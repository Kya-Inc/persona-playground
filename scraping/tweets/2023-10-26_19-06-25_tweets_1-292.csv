@SBF_FTX,2022-10-30T13:26:49.000Z,"8) One last thing:

I *am* seriously concerned that some relatively strident/adversarial strategies would end up backfiring and undermining DeFi.

@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:57:02.000Z,"24) Sometimes the easiest answer is the right one.

Zuck is planning to spend tens of billions on building out The Metaverse because he believes in The Metaverse.

@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:57:02.000Z,"25) Facebook has the largest possible social media network on the web.  They won.

So what's next?

Start building Social Media 3.0.",87,39,318
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:57:01.000Z,"23) So, to be clear, I *do* think that the above claims might be true:

Facebook wanted to distract people from its reputation and its lack of headroom for growth, and so it became Meta.

But I think there's probably something else, too.  Something that explains the next $10b.",18,5,77
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:57:01.000Z,"22) Which makes no sense if this is all a diversion.

It's one thing to blow $10b/year on smoke bombs.

It's another thing to blow $10b/year on smoke bombs that don't produce very much smoke.

Why throw good money after bad?",10,9,62
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:57:00.000Z,"21) Except there's one last problem.

Investors have now decided that spending $10b per year on The Metaverse is dumb, and Facebook (er, sorry, Meta)'s stock is tanking.

The vague meta guidance is no longer working.

And yet Zuck keeps spending.",18,10,64
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:56:59.000Z,"20) And so that could explain why Facebook did it:

to distract from its reputational problems, and to project on a vague and unclear and futuristic enough space that they could convince people that maybe they were going to make another $100b from it,

Facebook became Meta.",12,6,89
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:56:59.000Z,"19) You need something which is everything and nothing.

Something which could be the whole world, but where no one knows what to expect or how to know if you're doing it yet.

You need The Metaverse.",9,7,66
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:56:58.000Z,"18) Something with the following properties:

a) People think that maybe it could get really big.  Like, $100b revenue big.

b) If Facebook plows $10b into it people will be like ""yes, that is how you make this thing really big, I guess, sure"", and not ask any more questions.",9,4,55

@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:22:33.000Z,"19) That's how we operate, and the way that we would be able to collaborate.

If that doesn't work--if we aren't able to have a nuanced, detailed conversation acknowledging realities--then that sucks, but so be it.

There's no point in debating if it isn't constructive.",10,2,36
@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:22:33.000Z,"20) And the only remaining decision is whether we should run with *our* beliefs about what is best, or whether someone else should take the lead.  And we're fine either way!

@SBF_FTX,2022-10-29T22:22:33.000Z,"18) So anyway, long story short:

If people disagree with us, we're super excited to chat and see if we can come to agree!  Hopefully we can do so in a *constructive* way that acknowledges nuance and cares about the details and doesn't try to steamroll or judge.",10,2,31
