        "0": "stuff again today we have an exclusive interview with Sam bankman free discussing the bankruptcy of his billion dollar company FTX why he hates when people talk about his love life and his massive donations to political parties now since going bankrupt and being accused of fraud Sam's been mostly quiet but recently that changed when he gave an interview to a citizen journalist Tiffany Fong now we've actually talked about Tiffany's work on the show before last time she released an Insider call of a different billion dollar fraud Celsius this time she's talking to Sam bankman freed and since I know a lot about FTX hopefully I can provide some context in fact checking where needed because Sam he lies a lot now we'll be talking to Tiffany later but for now let's talk about one of the biggest claims in the call you might have heard by now that ",
        "1": "Sam was the second largest Democrat donor in 2022 which in addition to his significant donations to news outlets might have been one of the reasons that he was covered so favorably with an image of being the most generous billionaire But ultimately Sam told Tiffany on a call that this wasn't the full story they do need a thousand about the great citizens united being literally the highest profile Supreme Court case of the decade and I think everyone's hospital when they talk about campaign Finance for some reason efrac is no one can possibly fasten the idea that someone team practice actually gave dark so I don't know all my Republican donations were dark wow Sam is claiming he gave Republicans the same amount but under the table the citizens united ruling that he's referring to it allows people to donate so-called dark money to influence politicians in other words Sam wouldn't be required to disclose that donation and the reason he wanted to do ",
        "2": "it this way was so that basically the journalists would like him more and the reason was not a regulatory reason is because reporting just freak the out if you donate to a republican Charleston liberal and didn't want to have that fight so I just made all the Republican ones darts all right there's a lot to unpack here let's start with the fact is this even true I I don't know I have no idea he could be lying Sam lies all the time for example anyone remember what he said FTX was solvent right before it went bust yeah so because of that because I don't know if he's lying I decided I'd try to verify these dark money donations go figure I couldn't because the money is it's it's dark you're not supposed to be able to find it but either way if he's lying this looks bad for him but if he's telling the truth it looks worse I mean it shows you how cynical Sam was he never cared about politics he cared about power and perception that's why he played both sides so he always would come out on top and worst of all they ",
        "3": "bought it the media loved him some of them still love him and going back to the part about trustworthy though this is what's kind of hard about covering Sam in general everything has an asterisk or a question mark next to it because unfortunately Sam is very biased against not going to jail he wants that to be the outcome here so everything we talk about needs to be viewed through that lens so for the next part of this call I want to talk about an example of how Sam lies and obfuscates the truth because so much of it is about trying to craft an image with Sam obviously we just talked about how he tried to craft an image of being this generous billionaire but after the FTX blow up well he can't be that anymore what's the new image well instead of being a fraud the new image is a a smart guy who made an embarrassing mistake and you'll hear that in how he answers this next question which is essentially talking about the back door in FTX which was used to defraud customers and pay ",
        "4": "attention to how he answers it mean I feel like there's something about a back door that allowed you to execute commands that could alter the company's Financial records without alerting others something like that this was put in place I think that was a Reuters article um which made it seem like you secretly were moving money in the background wait and this is something that I would be doing I don't know it kind of said that SBF put like a secret back door so that he was moving funds to Alameda and it was undetected like this was something that you put into place potentially I mean that's how it read on the article well I think for things because that I can tell you is definitely not true okay I don't even know how to code is the honest embarrassing after no I certainly wasn't like building some back door in the system I could barely use this system um user interface perspective ",
        "5": "um but I uh I literally never hoping to code it all right so for any of us yeah um so I hear me build the back door in there and I don't know exactly what they're referring to I find this response to be so telling because Sam is lying here while telling the truth I mean it is technically correct that he didn't build the back door in FTX for Alameda but he wasn't even the person accused of building it because it turns out Tiffany had misremembered the Reuters article it wasn't Sam it was Sam's right-hand man Gary Wang who was accused of building it now this is obviously a simple mistake and Sam would know what she's talking about who she's talking about and that Gary had built it but instead of answering the real question Sam uses this minor slip up to create a loophole for himself to dodge accountability oh what I coded it no I didn't code it I don't code that's clearly a lie because I don't code at all see this couldn't be true because I don't code and he frames everything as ",
        "6": "this Preposterous idea while full well knowing that his partner is the guy who built it and he uses it to dodge the part of the story where he stole money and springboards into the part where he can sell his preferred narrative that he just made an embarrassing mistake well they try and give you the nearest neighbor to that so like the thing that is true that like Smooth resembles that statement which is that um uh there was a stuff uh long and I was wrong I didn't correct on elevated balances on FDX by a seriously large number an embarrassingly large new one and it was because of a like very poorly labeled the accounting thing which was a historical artifact of a time before when like from before SKS bank account and the result of that was basically there was a time way back Yonder when people would wire money to ",
        "7": "Alameda and then actually credited on FPS that is basically never got screwed up and that was like a pretty big uh yeah I meant that Alami was like substantially more lovers than I thought it would I don't know if that's what that comments talking about but that's the best thing I think the sort of closest thing I can think of for it this is the image Sam wants to sell you one where he didn't steal money he just fell prey to a mistake a historical artifact an accounting error honestly sounds like it could happen to anyone you forget you had that number in the spreadsheet and oops it turned out to be eight billion dollars of your customers money now he's not explicit about what this accounting error was but I can guess based on what he said because back in the day FTX didn't have a bank account for customer funds so they had customers wire money to Alameda research their sister company instead of FTX and FTX would then just credit that money to their customers ",
        "8": "accounts so I'm guessing Sam's explanation here is that they mislabeled those incoming funds to Alameda as alameda's funds and then somehow forgot that they owed those FTX people their money it's just a number on a website somewhere when they go out to cash it out all of a sudden it's like well Oh I thought that was alameda's money that's the strongest defense I can maybe think of here that oh we had this complicated accounting system that was confusing and we screwed up oopsy-doopsy we lost eight billion dollars and crucially you'll notice that Sam's explanation requires no amount of fraud or stolen money it's just a poorly labeled account it's an embarrassing mistake and we even saw this end up on one of Sam's internal spreadsheets as a quote hidden poorly internally labeled Fiat account which he says actually explains most of this story this whole long Saga okay and then there's like a dumb gay count that we've labeled confusingly it's four years ago and that was like two-thirds of the whole song now this ",
        "9": "has to be one of the most transparent dog ate my homework excuse just in the world of High Finance you know I mislabeled an account I I just accidentally labeled your money as my money oops sorry guys lost eight billion dollars there didn't mean to do that I mean again this is me reading into what he said here about why he lost it we still don't know exactly what this internally labeled account is I'm just trying to give the best explanation from the available evidence but either way Sam claims that even despite all of this the real mistake was actually declaring bankruptcy in the first place because without it well things would kind of be fine I'm like right now right now and not just us International as well and uh I might still get there we'll see I don't know it might happen it might not but I uh ",
        "10": "two minutes after I filed for bankruptcy four billion more payments um are you able to add it to the estate I'm working on it but the current Trustees of the state would rather burn it all to the ground out of steam and it's time to find a way to bring more value to customers so right now it's like in a jurisdictional battle between countries over the band Garcia's all right a lot more to unpack here Sam claims that FTX and FTX us would have basically been fine had he not filed for bankruptcy because he got four billion dollars in liquidity minutes after filing now the problem with this is that we just have no evidence any of this is true and given all the past claims of Sam that have proved to be wrong like his solvency I find this very incredible it's very convenient when you think about it that oh we got a bailout right after I can't help anything anymore and that those darn bankruptcy lawyers just want to burn it all down somehow I doubt that anybody would turn down four billion dollars for customers but that ",
        "11": "appears to be the story Sam's sticking with in addition to this Sam also insists that FTX is not as bad off as people say here's him responding to a claim that users will get almost nothing from the bankruptcy well I mean not nothing like I think sorry there's that's not counting like just liquid assets that are there and I think if nothing happens if I can never do anything get into their own prices eventually us will get a penny on the penny a dollar on the dollar once they get around to admitting that and an international get found like 20 25 cents all the dollars so I don't know exactly what something like that now these are just more wild lies from Sam specifically about the part about FTX International which is hopelessly insolvent he claims it only needs four billion dollars but that's not true the only way he arrives at this number is because he's counting billions of dollars in coins that FTX has as real money while football knowing he could never sell that so I find this to be kind of dishonest because like if I create coffee coin and create a billion tokens sell one of them for a dollar ",
        "12": "technically my market cap would be a billion dollars uh but you'd be a fool to actually believe that's what I'm worth but that's essentially what Sam's doing with his own balance sheet he's treating these coins which he owns the majority of as if he could sell them at the current market price which everyone knows he can't and this denial also extends to his own coin ftt which is the native token of FTX which used as collateral to get these loans now Sam says is probably a mistake to use them as collateral but he argues that ftt was really valuable although hearing him explain how is pretty interesting I think FCU is basically more legit than most tokens in some ways like I think it's his value is more economically underpinned than the average uh you know than the average spoken was that being said um why do you feel that way strong uh oh it's like Divine burning like you know it's not it's not just like a token that that like does nothing but you ",
        "13": "can't at least he does something now I'm kind of speechless here Sam seems to be suggesting that his token doesn't do nothing therefore is justifiably worth a billion dollars this is despite the fact that he created it from thin air and owned most of the tokens uh it's just so insanely cynical in my opinion his real justification for its use case is only these by and burns he did with the ftt token which is just basically where FTX spent money to buy up a bunch of ftt tokens which they owned most of so it's literally arguing that pumping your own price makes a token valuable I I don't know it's akin to saying my Ponzi is better than your Ponzi because I pump my own money back into it sometimes I I don't know it's ridiculous and it reminds me of a video we did six months ago where Sam described everything as a Ponzi scheme well it seems fitting that he actually created a Zone token with similar Ponzi nomics with a few extra bells and whistles I suppose now funny ",
        "14": "enough after this long call spent dodging or being duplicitous about his responsibility of fraud here Sam complained about reporters not being interested in the real story the boring story and he said that he's tired of getting questioned about these provocative questions like his relationship issues the problem is that at the end of the day their metric is quick like that's what they need to get and it's fine it is what it is but like what it means is that like a boring story won't tell and so they're going to be trying to ask me like the most provocative possible questions I kind of felt like all right like we as a society have in my opinion my humble opinion spent about enough time this week trying to figure out whether anyone in uh living in Albany with polyamorous I found this answer really amusing since he's the one who's been dodging hard questions this entire time and then says ",
        "15": "no one wants to hear the real story and also then brings up his personal life and says why do people keep asking about my personal life like wait a second you just brought that that up so I find it really weird to be complaining about nobody wanting the real story and then not answering hard questions about back doors and instead talking about your relationship I just thought that was really funny now so far I've spent a lot of time talking about Sam's credibility or lack thereof but to me this all begs the question what can we learn from Sam who's so calculated who's so intent on building this reputation or this image of himself and he just isn't a reliable narrator and I think the only honest answer is that we can see how flawed and warped his reality really is because in Sam's World he's still the good guy he just made an honest mistake an embarrassing mistake sure but an honest one it's the lawyers who screwed him who want to burn things to the ground he's standing on the sidelines with four billion dollars that no one's seen ready to put it all in to save everyone if you ",
        "16": "only let him sell you his Ponzi tokens on the way out it'll all be fine but we know the truth things are not fine at FTX reality has finally barged its way into the Bahamas and it's taking hold so I want to wrap this up by speaking to the person who's responsible for this interview Tiffany Fong I wanted to ask how she even got this interview since so few people have been able to speak to Sam I was surprised that he was willing to chat with me too I'm not a traditional journalist or a reporter I literally only started posting about crypto at the end of June because I lost a lot of money to Celsius Network so I mostly started posting on Twitter and YouTube just to vent but a few months into posting Celsius employees started sending me leaked information like leaked files and leaked audio one of which was a leaked internal All Hands meeting that I posted on September 13th to the public and I think you actually briefly covered that in one of your videos but Sam bankman freed started following me that day so we had a couple ",
        "17": "of free friendly exchanges on Twitter a couple of them I think are actually Republic so our DMS were already open when FTX filed for bankruptcy on November 11th so I just figured I would shoot my shot and see if he'd be willing to chat with me I really was not expecting a response from him but a few days later on November 16th he said he'd be happy to chat and he actually suggested a voice chat so that's how all this came about and it's all still kind of shocking to me as well that's so crazy because basically you're one of the few people who got a call with Sam I don't think he's spoken to many other people definitely no one else that I know of on audio so I understand that you'll be releasing the full call yourself on your YouTube channel but you know how long is it how long is this call where can people learn more about you the call should be about 20 minutes long I did redact some of the parts that he explicitly told me not to repeat but yeah I'll post a call on my YouTube channel because I think that a lot gets ",
        "18": "lost on Twitter threads so for sure for short guys be sure sure to go check out the full call on Tiffany's page I'll link both of her Twitter and YouTube on uh in the description below that's all for now thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one "
