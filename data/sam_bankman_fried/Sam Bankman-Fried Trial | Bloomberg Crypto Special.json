        "1": "that we actually defy the label consultant because sometimes consultant seems to imply that we only give advice and when you look at what Accenture does we're really different than the traditional version of a consultant we're really about relevance and results and that's what is uh driving our business what about a Consulting project in my example I'm the CEO I have a problem I call you up I say solve my problem or give me a solution we don't operate as big companies permanently in crisis mode and so when you think about like how long does it solve things a lot of it starts with you know the company being willing to set aggressive goals and so what we are trying to do now is work with our clients to work differently and to work faster how did Jeff Bezos realize you could sell anything on the internet the web was growing at something like 2,300 per a year anything growing that fast is is going to be big why did Bill Gates ",
        "2": "create control alt delete kind of become the poster child of hey couldn't you have made the stuff a little simpler and what inspired Diane von fenberg to create the rap dress the rap dress created me on the David Rubenstein show I uncover The Untold Stories of the world's most successful leaders right here on Bloomberg it's really a reminder isn't it just how sensitive the markets are to any commentary about trade we did see some pressure on the UN we did see some pressure on the Futures that is now being reversed [Music] good afternoon and welcome to Bloomberg crypto I'm kitly lines with shanali bosic and I am live outside the US District Courthouse in New York City where FTX founder Sam bankman Freed's trial is underway we are starting with jury selection for what prosecutors call ",
        "3": "one of the biggest financial fraud cases in American history and Kayla we have a full lineup of guests for this hour we're going to hear from the former assistant us attorney for the southern district of New York that is Jos Josh naftalis plus Kristen Smith the CEO of the blockchain association former US senator Pat Tumi and kav auta from the Delta blockchain fund it's an awesome guest lineup but before we get there let's first take a moment to look back at how we got here you in the span of 3 years Sam bankman Frey became one of crypto's biggest stars in May 2019 bankman freed and business partner Gary Wong founded FTX its goal to create a safe and responsible platform for Traders by October 2021 Venture capitalists had poured Millions into FTX and A-list celebrities like former NBA player Shaquille O'Neal model Jazelle bunin and comedian Larry David had endorsed it that same year the fir was valued at $25 ",
        "4": "billion and users soared to more than 5 million globally at least 1.2 million of them in the US the FTX name became well known appearing on t-shirts in commercials and even on an NBA arena by early 2022 the Bahamas based company's valuation skyrocketed to $32 billion FTX had become one of the world's biggest crypto exchanges bankman Freed's net worth climbed to $26 billion and he said he wanted to do good with his money following effective altruism I both think it's not what I should do with my money I think I should be thinking about how I can help the world with it the then 30-year-old also became a major political donor he contributed tens of millions to bipartisan political action committees and frequented Capitol Hill to be a voice for his company and the industry at the time he had no plans to slow down I'm going to be here for the long term I have no plans to leave um you know that is not something that is on my C and but in November of 2022 things began to unravel coindesk ",
        "5": "reported that the crypto hedge fund bankman freed had also founded Alam research had a significant portion of its assets made up of ftt a token that FTX created in response on November 6th CZ the CEO of rival crypto exchange binance posted to social media saying quote we have decided to liquidate any remaining ftt on our books the move triggered a massive wave of withdrawals sort of like a run on the bank and FTX didn't have the funds to meet them in a rescue attempt FTX reached a deal with binance to sell itself but binance backed out we became very quickly there was a lot of funds missing like to the tunes of you know double digit Billings I couldn't trust any of the information in the data room so by November 11th it was over FTX filed for bankruptcy and bankman freed resigned as CEO that same month he apologized at a public event I made a lot of mistakes are are things I would give anything to be able to do over again ",
        "6": "um I didn't ever uh try to commit fraud on anyone but just a few weeks later Sam bankman freed was indicted accused of misappropriating billions of dollars at the cryptocurrency exchange it's fair to say that by any anyone's life this is one of the biggest Financial frauds in American history and we're joined Now by Bloomberg's Mr Elena Gul aulu who leads the US legal team here and has been covering the case when you look at what the prosecutors might bring forward to build their case what are you expecting so really Sam mman freed here faces seven charges five of which carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years the most important charge is the wire fraud charge which really speaks to the heart of what this case is about did SPF knowingly take money out of FTX customer funds and use them to you know engage in speculative trading through Alam research to buy real estate property in the Bahamas ",
        "7": "or to you know for political donations that is the gist of what the prosecutor's case is sort of relying on and what we're expecting to see is a lot of evidence of what was going on behind the scenes at FTX so think about that Infamous balance sheet that circulated when the story first broke or any data that shows you know what these Executives were talking about but the key here is to prove intent did SPF know that this was happening and if prosecutors are able to essentially prove that that sort of like gets SPF in a lot of trouble okay so if that's the aim of the prosecutors to prove intent how is the the defense likely to counter that considering Sam bankman freed has pleaded not guilty to all seven of these charges he's pleaded not guilty Kylie but he's also Kaye sorry but he's also been in jail for the past month which I think is an important thing to remember his bail was revoked and since then all of his lawyers have gone to the judge and said Hey listen it's been extremely ",
        "8": "difficult for us to prepare him for this case so he's kind of going into this trial already feeling like he hasn't necessarily been given enough time to prepare his defense what he's going to try to do based on what he's hinted leading up to the trial is essentially say this wasn't my fault I didn't intend for this to happen and I didn't know this was happening it was bad risk management but I never wanted to steal anyone's you know money and that's going to be sort of what he's really going to tried to push for but he has a lot to go up against particularly since the prosecution is bringing in three cooperating Witnesses Caroline Ellison Gary Wang and Asad sing Who are all in his inner circle and know what was going on behind the scenes so that is probably going to be one of the few Peak moments throughout the entire trial yeah and all three of course have pleaded guilty to criminal charges as well great setup Bloomberg's missina agu Polo thank you very much for joining us but let's look closer at what Hasen happening today and that is jury ",
        "9": "selection let's talk about how jurors are selected for such a high-profile case such as this one and bring in Chris Dominic senior Jury consulting adviser at IMs Consulting and expert service he has advised clients on some of the nation's highest profile trials so Chris thank you very much for being with us how difficult is this to find a jury in a case that has gotten so much media attention and has touched a lot of people it's difficult it'll definitely take some time uh they're going to want us question people pretty close about some of their attitudes on this particular case and they're going to want to dig in on some issues to try and get what we call cause challenges which are ways for the court to actually find that somebody may be biased and will basically remove them from the pool that means that the attorneys don't have to use some of their peremptory challenges that they only get a fixed amount of what do we know about the juror's perceptions of crypto and of this case itself given how high profile it has ",
        "10": "been we've already heard one of the jurors or potential jurors come forward and say she actually had an investment with FTX but feels that she could be impartial obviously that is not going to make it too far onto uh making the jury stand yeah no that's a difficult situation because if they say they can be fair but they had a big problem then it's up to the judge to determine if they are somebody who's suitable for this case or not I'll tell you in terms of the national understanding here we learn a lot of what we do through through focus groups and mock trials and there's also polls and in this particular case uh we have the fortunate nature that um the Pew company Pew research did a poll on what Americans who have heard about cryptocurrencies think about them and 75% are not confident in their safety and reliability so that means that the defense team has a lot of work to do and making sure that some of the people that are eligible potentially aren't going to be sort of biased from the very beginning how do you expect the ",
        "11": "prosecution and defense to employ strategies in this kind of scenario given even just the jury selection process is so difficult right right well I think the the key here is getting people to be as honest as they possibly can getting them to open up because certainly high-risk jurors for the prosecution are people who are anti-government anti-regulation people who are very Pro free market capitalism maybe even people that are fans of Sam bankman freed and maybe don't want to talk about it too openly but you can get get that out of them maybe they think he's misunderstood there's certainly some people that might say hey crypto is basically gambling and if you had your money in this you know you should have known what you were getting into that's not necessarily a broad sentiment but those are the kind of people you certainly have to uh identify and on the defense side you definitely want to make sure that people are talking about what their stance on government White Collar prosecutions ",
        "12": "are there's a lot of people who believe that the government hasn't been tough enough on white color crime as it should be they think it's really common for companies to cook the books or it's common for executives to get rich at the expense of everyday people that kind of thing is what you're trying to get out because that's the kind of thing that'll allow you to make some of your decisions about what we call deselection because although it's called jury selection actually you only have the power to get people off of the jury by using either cause challenges from the court or peremptory challenges from what you've been given which is a fixed amount on each side all right really helpful insight to get on this jury selection day in this trial IMS senior Jury consulting adviser Chris Dominic thank you very much we appreciate your time now coming up we're going to have more on how Sam bankman free plans to defend himself despite some of his closest allies set to testify against him here's how former FTX US president Brett Harrison who left ",
        "13": "the company before it went bankrupt felt after learning about the allegations it's so clear that there were deliberate steps taken to mislead investors to mislead internal employees like myself to hide what was happening from the general public and that that has been sort of the most shocking part of all of this that there was that this was not something that we could have ever really known given what steps were taken to to hide this from from everyone [Music] [Music] [Music] ",
        "14": "obviously we were trying to create shoes for me to wear in the Olympics and that was happening pretty quickly and then just understanding a new industry and how shoes are even made but as we went down that path and started to just learn and research more we learn that shoes have not been made for women what that means is a shoe is made off of a lass which is a mold of the foot and it's the mold of a man's foot used to make women sneakers and I I think it took time for us to really grasp that because you know we've been in shoe stores and we've gone to the women's section and it's like no there are shoes for women like what's this over here and then to really understand like all of that is marketing this is just a man's shoe like in a different color and so that kind of eye openening ",
        "15": "experience was just like okay we got to do this and even more than making the shoes like there's a deeper purpose here like women deserve better and we shouldn't be an [Music] afterthought people ask me all the time what is the key to being a really good investor and I tell them it's to surround yourself with and work with the best investors you can find on Bloomberg wealth I'm going to take you to meet the greatest investor in the world the people that I would like to have managing my money when you go through a period when it's super easy to raise money for any purpose or no purpose and you go into a period when it's difficult to raise money even for a good purpose clearly many more companies are going to found [Music] her not sophisticated at all uh sophisticated perhaps in the way ",
        "16": "uh they were able to sort of hide it from people uh uh frankly right in front of their eyes but this isn't this isn't uh uh you know sophisticated whatsoever this is just plain old embezzlement that was current FTX CEO John Ray testifying on Capitol Hill last year now let's discuss Sam bankman Freed's defense with former assistant us attorney for the southern district of New York Josh nalis he is now a partner at Palace Partners so Josh thank you very much for being here we of course have heard repeatedly from Sam bankman freed in the leadup to this trial actually beginning say it was never his intent to commit fraud on anyone he has pleaded not guilty to all of these charges how difficult is this going to be though for his defense team I think it's going to be a big lift for him intent in White Collar cases is always a hard thing to to prove up for the government but in this case as as Mr Ray said it's it was a straightforward case of embezzlement and ",
        "17": "misappropriation so Mr Mr beon freed is going to be faced with what is really a pretty simple story and I think it's going to be hard for him to to exent he takes on the burden defeat that well and of course the prosecution is aided by the fact that they have three pretty key cooperating Witnesses Gary Wong who co-founded FTX NAD sing who was the head of engineering Caroline Ellison who was the CEO of alamer research how critical are they going to be in this case I think they're going to be key I mean cooperating Witnesses are really the best evidence that the government has they give a window into what happened and that's what the jurors want to hear in the end the emails the bank records are a little dry but the drama is really from the people who committed the crime with them matter here Josh how difficult will it be for the government to be proving intent in a case like this I don't think this is going to be that hard of a a case for the government if they keep it at a high simple level ",
        "18": "which is this is Mr Ray said again this is about misappropriation lies and greed and with when Kaye mentioned the cooperating Witnesses between those and all the documents and the admissions that Mr bangr fre has made I think if the government uh keeps marching along as it will getting the evidence in uh we'll likely see a conviction how much is he expected to to testify himself I my expectation is that he he will testify or it's more likely than the average White Collar defendant and of course he's not average for a number of reasons Jos including that just a year ago this was someone who had tens of billions of dollars at his disposal and quickly saw it all uh disappearing obviously there are a number of charges in this case there's seven in total which in your mind are a the most serious and most likely to ",
        "19": "result in a conviction in the end they're all actually about the same thing I know that there's white collar wire fraud and securities fraud and conspiracy but the story is really taking money that he shouldn't have had misusing it and telling lies to investors and to the customers and of course conviction would really just be step one then there's the sentencing question and we've been talking all day about how he could very well if icted spend the rest of his life in prison given some of these charges come with a 20-year maximum sentence do you think if found guilty that that would actually happen what kind of sentence would you expect him to get yes he he faces if convicted life in jail mhm I mean the closest analog is Bernie maid off who of course got life in prison so I think that that will be the argument the government may make I think it's unlikely he gets that long in the end because he's so young oh interesting Josh obviously this is a historic case that we're seeing when it ",
        "20": "comes to the world of white collar crime uh it involves crypto but really it involves a lot of financial texting we've seen before in other white collar crime cases what about it to you is the most striking I agree with you it's it's it's a crypto case but it's it's not uh and that's what the government will focus on is that it's it's really just financial fraud in the crypto space I think the defense is going to want to make it all about crypto and the government's going to want to make it sort of of a piece with the standard large multi-billion dollar fraud that is is obvious for the jury to follow and we find often on this show Bloomberg crypto that there are varing degrees of familiarity with crypto as a concept so especially given today this jury selection that is happening how crucial is the jury and their pre-existing knowledge or not going to going to be in this case I don't think the pre-existing knowledge is is a good or a bad here I ",
        "21": "think what people meaning on either side of the of the case are going to want to to get out of the jury are people who have a bias for against crypto but the the understanding of crypto which no one can really pretend to be an expert in is not something that the government wants to go near uh I think the defense may want to go there but it's not something that we I would expect a jury to have and just on the subject of defense and we've said a number of times how Sam bankman freed is is unusual white collar crime defendant not just in that he may testify himself over the course of this trial but he has been so vocal in the media making appearances trying to make his case not having his defense attorneys do it how does that complicate things for his legal team I think it makes it it much more difficult he has he has great lawyers uh but controlling a defendant like him is as adding to their burden I mean the evidence is what it is it seems rather strong but when he's out in front of the media uh it's making it's he's just adding ",
        "22": "another layer obviously the judge is not happy with him either and finally we have been told that this trial could take weeks up to six weeks potentially unless something happens right do you think there's any real probability of potentially a plea deal or you think that is is not something that would be pursued in this case I don't think that the government's going to offer anything at this point I I read that uh one of the prosecutors said in front of the court this morning there have been no formal offers and now that they're in jury selection I think that they're going to make him what's called eat the indictment if if if if they've gone this far theyve prepared that it's a great team of prosecutors and I don't think that they're going to it's too late it's too late I think that's Pal's Partners Joshua navalis thank you so much for your time now coming up this month we learned that FTX sued the parents of Sam bakman freed for allegedly exploiting their access to the sun's wealth the details up next and as a reminder you can listen to Bloomberg's spellcaster podcast and The Chronicles of the rise and fall of bank and freed listen ad ",
        "23": "free on wondering Plus on Apple podcast and on Amazon music This is [Music] [Music] blumber [Music] ",
        "24": "Josh that's me Max what's up how are you I have been writing about Wall Street for almost 15 years and what that means is I write about feuds and rage and Rises and falls and comebacks and every now and then I also write about a couple of villains thank you so much and now I am about to do something new and very very scary we are making a show and is based on Bloomberg Business Week Magazine so what is this show about it's a show about money power culture pop business organize complicated and profound people about their ideas their careers their lives their risks their failures their imagination it's so incredibly liberating not to care what other people think I was giving my tools to other communities I wanted to bring those tools home tune in like please like really actually tune in I I desperately ",
        "25": "need an [Music] audience now FTX is suing s bman Freed's mother and father in order to quote recover millions of dollars in fraudulently transferred and misappropriated funds we're going to bring in Bloomberg's Max chafkin who recently wrote about how the Stanford Scholars opened the doors for Sam and provided a halo effect for his company when we're looking at this trial start to go underway there is a cloud over the head of the bankman freed family in terms of what was the role of his parents what was the role of his parents well it's it's complicated and as we've seen this uh proceeding proceed as well as the bankruptcy we're seeing that they ",
        "26": "are both kind of his parents they've served as the um you know the normal Mom and Dad role but also as his lawyers at times deao lawyers at times maybe at times His official lawyers um Sam bankman freed has been a little bit fuzzy on it and maybe deliberately so uh they are we should say famous uh law professors they both work at Stanford uh bankman Freed's mother Barbara freed um is a famous ethicist and and what what makes it so interesting about this case is that they were part of the reason that s bankman freed was taken so seriously you know a lot of people there there were reasons to be skeptical of an overseas crypto exchange and one of the big reasons investors you know including seoa capital and others went in with this company was that they thought hey the son of Sanford lawyers who what could go wrong okay so they lent him credibility and so much of this does come down to how that credibility ultimately imploded Max yet they haven't actually been accused of any wrongdoing here so are they likely to come up at all in this ",
        "27": "trial if not to testify are they are they likely to be to be used against him at all in some way well so so two things one is they have not been accused by prosecutors of any wrongdoing they' have not been charged um FTX you know the the company that is bankrupt is trying to recover customer assets has accused them of you know being part of the misappropriation of customer funds which they've denied um I I think it's looking unlikely that they will be you know testifying in court they will probably be in court you know they've been uh I I don't think they're there today but they've been there you know by his side throughout and there is some chance that they will come up um they've come up in the court filings you know uh they were you know cced you know on on numerous emails especially as the crisis was unfolding um and and and and Barbara freed as we we learned in the FTX lawsuit may have been involved in some of the political contributions which has been another sort of Nexus of prosecutorial you know question knowing that some of his friends or ",
        "28": "former friends at least have been cooperating with uh with the government on this trial what does this mean for maybe the Silence of his parents in between well I first of all I think you know there's a difference between somebody's parents and their and their colleagues and I think from the uh Prosecutor's point of view well I mean you know I I think uh if you believe the narrative the prosecutors have laid out right uh Sam bankman freed was this you know amazing fraudster Who tricked everyone I don't think it's hugely surprising again if you buy their narrative which Sam benen Frey denies that he would you know fool the parents and and so in some sense of all the people most likely to believe the story that he was telling you know who else but his mom and dad of course Sam bankman freed appears to have used that appears to have used the fact that his dad was was a lawyer and then eventually became an FTX employee to uh both you know operate the company and and and Joe bankman his father uh was involved in numerous decisions along the way um and also became sort of part of the public face of the company blomberg's Max chafkin thank you for your time I ",
