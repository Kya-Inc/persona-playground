        "1": "everybody's got a lot of expenses coming up but uh if a few folks have some extra bucks I know it'll be appreciated and it'll help her have a warmer season this year and she certainly deserves it so again GoFundMe Portland mass shooting paralyzed Survivor fund thank you ah God is dead and you Jamie Loftus have killed him I finally did it you did it you did it no God Was A Hymn and Jamie killed him Hammer to the back of the head and and people are going to be critical of that but you know they are you don't know my story and in my six part mini series in which I'm played by Amanda Seyfried I think we're gonna start to see my side of the story and I'm definitely not going to jail for what I did that's good unlike Elizabeth Holmes who we just found out has been sentenced to 11.25 years in in prison uh I'm kind of I like yeah I have mixed like I have mixed feelings because ",
        "2": "it's like people don't go first of all the prison industrial complex in general it doesn't make anyone better to the extent that there's value in the present day and putting people in prison it's people who are like a severe ongoing danger and I I don't see this making anything better like at the same time I hate her so I don't I'm not gonna it's not it's not gonna be the top Injustice I I Rue today I do kind of like that her uh after being exposed as an unrepentant criminal she's like oh I think I'm just going to kind of be like a normie girl for a while and I'm going to go normal kid yeah and you're like Liz it's too late it's too late for that Liz you defrauded people with a fake medical device that led folks to see to get treatment for things they didn't have and ignore illnesses they did which is bad not before too many bodies hit the ",
        "3": "floor but yeah that would have stopped you but you didn't really care you you applied Steve Jobs logic to something that was not just a silly box to keep in your pocket um Lizzie Lizzy uh Lizzie also putting her in prison for you know probably nine years when you consider all the other things is like not gonna help anything uh it'll just mean that that kid she has grows up without a mom for nine years and that's not gonna make the world better it's like it's a huge moment for many things can be true at once and just having to hold all of those truths and um still record an episode of behind the bastards I can I talk about illegal okay this actually this actually will be relevant to the episode but yes please please wait really yes okay this is definitely not going to be relevant so let's let's Okay I was a legal case I was thinking about today um was the the Beanie Babies billionaire ",
        "4": "um when he went was taken to court in 2013 for holding money in a Swiss bank account um he so it was like attack is that illegal oh a tax evasion tax evasion um so he was uh up for as many as five years in prison for tax evasion then he got off with uh I mean he's a billionaire he's never gonna suffer a consequence right but like he ended up getting a two years of probation on the ground that it had been too publicly humiliating so he didn't have to get to go to jail because he was awesome it was so embarrassing that he didn't have to go to jail what that's absolutely [ __ ] weird anyways I'm gonna I'm gonna see how far this goes by committing murder and then having my pants fall down and like well judge look yes I did stab that man 47 times but then everybody saw my Underpants yeah I pee peed myself so ",
        "5": "can we just zero this one out man I love the Beanie Babies story so much I'm surrounded by my beans feeling safe wow that's good you do literally have one on your shoulder right now yeah Patty the Platypus just just like I have this rifle next to me I think that we both have our comfort objects at the ready right um so Jamie speaking of Elizabeth Holmes because the person we're talking about today is gonna be the next story like that uh by this time next year there probably is going to be an HBO documentary about this guy oh God maybe Taylor Taylor Kitsch could probably play it um actually if he wanted to really like that Taylor Kitsch played hot David koresh in the Waco show I walked into that one yeah they'd have to give him like a belly suit or something that's not anti-fat I'm just being accurate uh but he could do it um maybe that is yeah I don't want to ",
        "6": "see this man ever again no I'm mad Taylor kids you don't want to see Taylor Kitsch again no you don't want to see those [ __ ] gutters again unbelievable God damn it Robert there's plenty of in this town Robert there's a million come gutters I don't need those oh that that is true but anyway so through the street do that that that is that is true of Los Angeles and no other city today we are talking about a guy who absolutely never comes Sam bankman freed why did you know this guy do you know this guy I don't know this guy you don't know this guy you don't know this guy have you have you caught any news in the last week about how like a massive cryptocurrency exchange has collapsed plummeted I did hear about that this is that guy oh this is the guy with his like polyamorous sex ring that was running a big crypto Bank in the Bahamas and it all fell apart now billions of dollars are gone you've lost me again oh great okay well I'll I'll try to this is ",
        "7": "still breaking um I we are because this is a Thanksgiving week episode we only do one episode on thanksgivings I needed a single one so I just want to give everyone background on this guy we will we may come back to this story because there's a lot we don't fully understand about how he did what he did and the degree to which but the gist of this is that this guy this guy ran a trading service called Alameda research and a crypto exchange an exchange is basically like a a bank right it's a cross between a bank and like a trading platform called FTX which was one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world and was also considered by most people to be the most stable and like ethical and legitimate right people who are just kind of on the outside looking at when everything collapsed earlier here this year right you remember that we have that video I was engaged in that it's just that I get a lot of my news yeah journalists on Twitter and they've been busy this week when the when the when crypto like fell ",
        "8": "apart when a lot of crypto fell apart earlier this year and like a bunch of places went under FTX was one of the ones that stayed stable and actually were buying up a bunch of like failing crypto companies to try to like prop up the industry they just collapsed and like the value of all everything has been plummeting for for the last several days it's a big disaster it is very light yeah and in in as in words that will annoy me as little as possible can you explain why FTS remains solvent and other it is not solvent oh now why did it Outlast because they lied um so they were they were operating the short end of how to describe it and and we may there will be more details to come but at present it seems fair to say that it was a giant Ponzi scheme where they were they were they were taking in money promising unreasonable returns using other investor money to gamble on stuff to try to provide them anyway and ",
        "9": "it works they were they were dishonest yeah it is it is very likely what what differentiates this is the scale because this is very likely a financial crime on the level of what Bernie Madoff did we are talking in the 10 to 20 billion dollars stolen wow a lot of money this is a serious Financial crime I'm hoping in on this pretty cool yeah I'm listening so it for the other Pro the other kind of mass of um like Touchstone of this is that it has led to a class action lawsuit against Larry David Shaquille O'Neal Tom Brady and a number of celebrities who were all in a a Super Bowl ad for FTX um I remember that ad that was so embarrassing for my man Larry the lawsuit is basically so advertised it was a high dollar Ponzi scheme and you guys were using your name recognition to sell on registered Securities which they were which they ",
        "10": "were which they definitely were sorry I just want to Circle back to Shaquille O'Neal will put his name on anything to the point where to the point where very funny I worked uh at a haunted hayride this year which we don't talk about because it was a bad idea but the Rivalry was a bad idea guess what I'm alive [ __ ] [ __ ] I lived I supported I live to tell the tale it's very unclear who is right in the side of should I work in a haunted hayride or not I still haven't really landed on an answer point being our closest rival haunted hayride was was shocktoberfest it was wow shack-themed haunted attraction in which the only Shack related thing was a gigantic inflatable Frankenstein that looked like Shaq which did sound awesome that sounds actually like the best time anyone's ever had I love shackle put his ",
        "11": "name on anything including crypto and Halloween what a what a king um probably not I'm sure there's horrible things about Shaq that have come out that seems almost unavoidable anyway Sam bankmanfried is the guy behind this gigantic Financial crime that is still unraveling as we do this episode and I want to talk about less about what happened on The Exchange because none of us want to talk about how somebody carries out the nuts and bolts of a cryptocurrency scam but I want to talk about pass out I want to talk about the social elements of this scam I want to talk about how he conned the media how he conned celebrities and how he conned regulators and I I just want to talk about also the way some of these people talked and wrote about him because there's a lot about I don't know a week or so ago we did an episode on The Daily Show we do it could happen here about ethical altruism which is in brief a theory that like the instead of trying to help people just because they need help you should only help people after you consider the way ",
        "12": "to help people that is like the absolute most beneficial way for like the least amount of you know effort it's utilitarianism right what kind of how can I do the greatest good with the the the the least resources and one nice amount of yeah and it's it's the way a lot of these like it and it's merged with this kind of thinking towards what billionaire types call long termism and the gist of this is like it's not worthwhile for me to do stuff like pay taxes to have a society or guarantee like Universal Health Care instead I should make instead the most ethical thing that I should do is make as much money as I personally can and then put that money into things that I believe will save the world like research to stop AIS from killing everyone and getting to Mars and [ __ ] it's a way for billionaires they're really fast trains it's a way for billionaires and the other Mega Rich to justify like continuing to do exactly what they want and feel like they're saving the world anyway Sam bakeman free guy from Beanie Baby you know the Beanie Babies billionaire did to improve the world he made a lot of Beanie Babies ",
        "13": "and then he bought the Four Seasons Hotel and kept making Beanie Babies he didn't do [ __ ] that's well you know that's I'm fine with that compared to these guys because they're all doing the Elon Musk thing where they're pretending anyway Bank Sam bankman freed is one of these guys and we're gonna get into that but we did this episode on it could happen here where he was kind of a tangential character in this very unsettling and and Insidious movement that is behind guys like Elon Musk who are claiming to be saving the world while just [ __ ] over people and then like four days after it came out his entire life unraveled and his fortune disappeared overnight because he was a giant con artist what a treat it's very funny so that's why we're talking about him right now he's like 30 years old and looks like Mark Zuckerberg and David dobrik's love child he's 30 years old I feel great about myself right now Mark Zuckerberg and David dobrik's love child look I shouldn't call anyone a schlub but he looks like a schlub I forget what David dobrik looked like because my brain protects myself ",
        "14": "respectfully I understand two villains two villains love child yeah um anyway so I uh yeah Sam bankman freed was born in 1992 on the campus of Stanford University uh continuing a long and proud tradition of absolutely nothing good ever coming from that hell hole his parents are both extremely prominent Stanford professors his mother Barbara is a lawyer her clo who clerked for the second circuit court and graduated from Harvard she founded mind the gap a somewhat shady and mysterious Democratic fundraising group I think it's Shady in that people don't exactly know where all the money comes from or like what their goals are she also had some shady yeah yeah she also pinned an essay in 2013 that the right wing is going nuts about because she was basically arguing that like it good and evil are less a factor in in what people do than environmental factors and and all that stuff like when people do things that are bad it's more ",
        "15": "often a product of their invite it was kind of a um oh God what's that [ __ ] psychologist uh it was like a Skinner type argument where it's like well if people have bad inputs in their youth then that's going to determine anyway um I think that's funny given what happens um I I'm gonna guess she sucks at what she's she she's she sucks uh and so does his dad Joseph bankman okay uh Joseph is also a lawyer he is a graduate from Yale uh his big claim to fame was developing a proposal for an overhaul of the California tax return system that would have filled out citizens tax returns in advance and I do no I just said he sucked but actually that sounds like a good thing um I think that that's actually a cool thing to advocate for the measure failed by one vote after heavy lobbying from Intuit a tax prep software company vote oh [ __ ] yeah it kind of is it's it's total [ __ ] because stuff it's the thing everybody agrees with on paper but nobody will actually fight the tax prep companies which is like hey the IRS like knows more or less what I make and like ",
        "16": "knows more or less what I owe why don't I just get a thing from them why do I have to go through this like anyway there's no need but it's like that's the only other countries do it that way we don't though and it's because because there has to be a convoluted system that's expensive and where they can charge you if you make the tiniest mistake because you can't read size one font well and more to the point because I don't actually think the IRS is advocating to keep it a pain in the ass I think it's these tax prep companies um because they have an entire industry based on charging people to do the thing that they have to do to avoid going to [ __ ] prison um anyway I I said he's an [ __ ] and I'm sure he is but he was right about this and I don't know what to say about that uh like all of us Joseph is also a podcaster he is the host the co-host of the stand legal podcast oh and so horrible times too and he's a nerd well if it wasn't the holiday season and I wasn't like getting ready for friends and family and all that that good stuff I would have listened to his podcast and ",
        "17": "we would probably be making fun of him but you can do that on your own oh my goodness I believe it isn't it doesn't it feel so horrible when you think of how many people do what we do but they're the worst person you've ever heard of it's so sad it's embarrassing yeah it's it's like I don't know I avoid self-identifying as a podcaster as it is it's still not assistant but then on top of that they're like oh like what like I mean you know you know the only you know the only thing that that I can compare it to is like when I started making a living as a writer 15 years ago and I would say that at like a at like a a party or something someone would ask like well what do you do and I'm like well I'm a writer and like four other people would say yeah me too uh and then you wind up listening to everybody's pitches for their novels that they're never going to finish um and So eventually I just started lying and saying that I still worked at special ed well I like I mean it's the same thing ",
