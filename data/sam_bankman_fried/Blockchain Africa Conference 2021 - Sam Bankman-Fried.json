        "0": "[Music] all right so um yeah i want to talk about serum today and i guess i want to start from from what where why serum is instead of what it is um and i and maybe let's just start with what defy is um you know what is defined why is d5 um you know decentralized finance is this thought that you know sure one thing you do with crypto is you can buy and sell tokens um but if you look at a blockchain it's not just a way to move tokens around um a blockchain really at its heart is a full decentralized computer and i think this is like one of the things that ethereum really showed um and it's it's really ethereum's hallmark and it sort of changed the industry forever um that people realized that um you know you can do anything on a blockchain it's you know they're basically turning ",
        "1": "complete um so you can program whatever programs you want into a blockchain and and that sort of led to the realization that well wait could you program a cryptocurrency exchange in to a blockchain itself and the answer is yes you can um you know you can sort of write out all the code for you know swapping assets with each other and and you can write it directly into the blockchain and that's what that's where dex is a decentralized exchange and the really cool thing about it um well there are a lot of really cool things about it one is that uh you you kind of have to be honest if you're doing it um all the you know you make public the code and it's immutable it's just sitting there on the blockchain anyone can look at it um and then anyone can interface with it and you take yourself out of the equation there's no person running the exchange it runs itself or you know the blockchain runs it um so that's really cool but another really cool thing is that anyone can use it and anyone can build on it ",
        "2": "so if adam comes and builds uh a decentralized exchange into some blockchain and then bob comes and bob wants to build some you know retail facing application and they want to have the ability to trade assets in it you know usually when you start up a new application that has to have trading in it it's a huge hassle like you have to figure out how how to build an exchange that's our step one uh and and and that that sort of like makes it really hard to to build new cool types of companies if you have to start out by building the old ones but in d5 you can just compose with the existing dexes you can just plop adam's deck straight into your product um as if it just natively is built for it put whatever gui you want on top of that and you're done and so you can take any existing decentralized products um and put them into your product and that's super awesome ",
        "3": "because it means that you can start building things by piecing these together i think one of my favorite examples is borrow lending plus a dex so if you have a borrow lending protocol like ave or compound you have a dex like unit swap or sushi swap um you can just click those together and create a margin trading exchange where all in one transaction you like send assets to the bar lending protocol you borrow something you send it back to the dex you purchase with it and now you've done a margin trade um and you can't do that in centralized finance like if you try and piece two different exchanges together one of which for bar lending and one for the actual exchange it's gonna be a massive pain and it's not gonna feel like it's one product it's gonna feel really disjointed so so that's sort of like a second really powerful thing about d5 um i think that's key there's this composability this sense that projects can build on top of each other because without it everyone is building their own little ",
        "4": "mini island their own little mini decentralized application and you're sort of back where you started like everyone you know trying to run their own company um instead of building this giant exponentially growing ecosystem of applications that people can piece together um and and i think that's where a lot of the power of d5 is or a lot of the power of the potential of d5 um but you run into now one of the big constraints um which is that if this is your goal um you know you've got uh however many applications exist in in this sort of hypothetical defy ecosystem um all combined together you know all maybe composing with each other and you know they all have computational needs they all through but the only transactions um and how many do they need well i think it's actually a really important question to ask i think it has really really big implications and you can actually sort of address it um and you really what it gets down to is how big are you hoping it gets ",
        "5": "how big you're hoping this decentralized ecosystem gets if your goal is to have like something which is the size of uniswap today in usage then you know you need two transactions a second or something i i think it's like roughly what uniswap uses um now it's super expensive you're spending 100 sometimes on the transactions but um but sure that's a service you know like uh five users uh at once or you know something like 20 000 a day you know maybe a hundred thousand to a 500 000 total ever um but you know really the goal is all more than that what if you want to build something massive what if you have a vision for for crypto and for d5 which is bigger than just one protocol right now what if you imagine a world where 100 million or a billion people are using d5 right a world where it's gone mainstream and where it's powering everyday applications ",
        "6": "um what does it take then and i don't know you can just look at these things right you can look at nicer nasdaq you look at facebook or twitter you look at visa um and they all sort of you know tend to take something between ten thousand and million transactions a second that's sort of the ballpark but these are global scale applications really require and i mean that sort of makes sense you know if you have 100 million users um and they're uh you know each taking a few actions a day you can just sort of figure out how many actions a second it's going to be um and two i think that if you want d5 to get huge you need to have something like a million transactions a second um and anything less than that is just gonna be you know that your your goal is gonna be that much smaller um so okay so so so far it's been pretty high level and and you start sketching out the some of those sort of constraints on it what does this mean well it means that you have to make a choice also about whether it's all going on one blockchain ",
        "7": "or if they're it's going on a lot of different shards or blockchains or non-composable elements and you could do it such that you just run like a million blockchains in parallel each with 10 transactions a second the problem is that they're not really interacting with each other you lose composability applications can't build on each other and no single application can be any more than 10 transactions a second um you know twitter alone is like hundreds of thousands so like you know say goodbye to anything that scale um so really you want this all composable you want those all in one shard um and you want like a million tps and you know if you get 10 000 tps instead then it can only get one percent as big you know you're sort of like winning case of the like best that this can do is like one million users instead of a hundred million users which is suicide um uh it's really sad because you're sort of giving up on crypto becoming huge you're giving up on it going mainstream and you're giving up on it powering ",
        "8": "everyday applications and you're just saying yes it's always going to serve a niche thing which is really not not the goal um okay so uh so now let's see where we are so ethereum has 10 transactions a second and that's just the end of the story um that is a factor of 100 000 too low and that's why you can get 10 000 users and no more on it you just can't have more uh there are no transactions for them that's never going to change i so you can give up on that um but you know there are more things in the ethereum ecosystem and there's ethereum 2.0 it'll come out at some point and that's probably get you know a few thousand gps per shard and then multiple shards so you can get a lot if you put it all together um but no single application can be bigger than like a thousand gps and applications for charts can't compose with each other um it depends what your vision is for d5 you know at a thousand tps you know you're gonna be something like a factor of you know 100 to a thousand smaller than the grand vision you know you're ",
        "9": "going to be looking at 100 you know at a million users max um and uh you know you're not going to be anywhere near one of the largest applications in the world or at least no single application on it can be anywhere near one of the largest in the world i think that's losing a lot of the upside of deep i think sort of settling for for something not so great um you can look at roll ups you get sort of similar stories um and and so i think if you want to have a million people in d5 and you really want to have it in a really powerful way and possible way you you just need to find a blockchain with a million tps which is how it is um and there's sort of not much i don't know i don't think there's any way around that um you're just giving up on the upside if you don't do it and and nothing will ever recover for that like nothing can really compensate for it um so so okay um so now you're looking at blockchains with a million tps and and what i think there are none ",
        "10": "no blockchains have a million tps right now no public blockchains do you know decentralized ones um but okay what's the biggest you can get one of the road maps and that's where we get to salon salon is at about 50 000 tps right now which is enough to host like any one application in the world sort of or a bunch of big but not huge applications um but it's also still growing pretty quickly in tps um and he's gonna get to a million or so in the next couple years so it's sort of on the on track on the roadmap to get to where it needs to get although it'll take a lot of clever engineering work to get there there are a few other blockchains that are sort of like trying most aren't with blockchains aren't even trying to get anywhere near a million tps ever and so you just i think that you know they can never have the base version of it um so um so okay that's sort of where solana comes into this story um and that's why i you know that that's sort of why uh ",
        "11": "serum started building out on solana because it was one of the only blockchains which even has the ambition to get as big as it would need to get uh in order to host world scale applications um it's okay what is serum then serum is basically um an attempt to build out the framework to build out the fundamental primitives and tools that could power an ecosystem of a billion people on chain um and what that means is basically thinking all right if you're gonna try and build some massive on-chain product what things are you gonna need like what are you gonna really hope someone's already built that you can compose with um and well one thing is in exchange um a lot of products need some sort of exchange um and the really cool thing is that because of sort of the speed and throughput and and cost effectiveness of solana um there's a dex on serum uh which is actually full ",
        "12": "exchange it's not just an amm um it has an order book it has a matching engine you can place limit orders at any price in either direction um there is you know price time priority it just works the way exchanges do and it's live and you use it today and you know there's there's some ui elements that need to be made better um but but it feels sort of like an exchange it's fast it costs 100th of a penny to do a trade um it can process thousands of trades a second and i as you know 100 order books or something as market makers with like scales that are constantly updating you can place your own limit orders you know to make your taker it's actually a full exchange um that's super cool and it's basically the only fully on chain matching engine and order book based exchange that's uh that sort of uh high functioning um so um so okay um that's that's sort of one piece but it's not the only piece ",
        "13": "um what else do people want well borrow lending it's a really core piece of law financial infrastructure is the ability to lend assets out for yield the ability to borrow assets to margin trade um and a bunch of people built out borrow lending protocols and serum so there's oxygen which launched recently it's in alpha right now um which is a fully on chain full serve prime brokerage model of risk management and pool based like trading and borrow lending uh there's mango markets which has a simpler streamlined uh margin system built on top of the serum decks just composing with it um what else is there well amms one really cool thing you do on serum is what radium did so radiums it's an amm like unit swap um same curve same you know you you you put your you know whatever you're you're eating your usdc in and you provide in that that same way you get fees when people trade on it um but the really cool thing about it is that it's not a standalone application it's composing with the decks so it the way that it provides to takers ",
        "14": "is it sends maker orders on a serum decks and the really awesome thing there is that means that it doesn't just get order flow from the people who randomly happen to go to its website to trade on it anyone who trades on the serum decks from anywhere will be able to trade against radio and that that's the whole point of a matching engine right is that like you could have someone providing liquidity on it and someone else who has no idea about that first person go and take that liquidity and trade with them without having to directly match each other up um so that's super cool and it means that radium just has the access to you know potentially your rebates from all the flow from anyone using serum anywhere not just radium specific order flow um so that's something else which is live um and i you know what else is there uh one super cool thing which i think is launching soon is um is a media network say streaming ",
        "15": "um uh platform it's a a decentralized it's basically sort of like uh you know you can think of it as like a sort of streaming platform but on chain like bittorrent but on chain um and allows people to coordinate passing content back and forth in sort of a trustless way um i and it's sort of like obviously a lot of applications that that could that could empower um uh you can look at bonfita which is basically building something which composes with a lot of the big protocols in serum and build service uh you know a gui that uh people can access all of them from um and and integrate them with each other um there are a bunch of wallets being built out there other random tooling um and there's a bunch more on the roadmap and and and really the goal is build out all of these products such that if you know visa or twitter or someone like that came tomorrow i was like i want to build my ",
        "16": "thing but on chain you really great build on serum and already most of the the core things you need are there you just compose with them you don't need to rebuild them all you need to do is think about your product and your gui and your positioning and your structure um and so one thing that i'd be really excited if someone built with was a fully general encrypted on-chain messaging system and social network system where you could just basically specify exactly which people had access to to decrypt um what you wrote and so it could be anything from just dm'ing back and forth to tweeting to the world or anything in between and it could act as the backbone for everything from twitter to chat to facebook to you know whatever other social networking you wanted to use all on chain and any application could build it in any application could trivially tap into the existing communication networks you could even have like on you know type things into your chat that would cause trades to happen if you ",
        "17": "wanted again it's all happening on chain um so is that sort of another thing i'd be excited for um but then what's the end game here so okay so you have a scalable blockchain which could directly support a billion users you have these core applications which are like used in many different products what's a value accretion in the end the final step of this is then actually taking a version of a product that has mass appeal and mass use and putting it on chain using the salon blockchain and using these fundamental primitives built out on serum and so you know if you want to then launch on chain twitter you can just do it and it would just work and and all you'd have to think about is is the user interface and and you know economics and things like that um uh and you know one example of this is maps on me it's uh has a hundred million plus downloads and he's going to ",
        "18": "be composing with oxygen and the serum decks and other things on serum to offer trading investment yield and cross-border remittances uh to all its users uh so anyway that's uh that's sort of where crm comes from and hopefully where it's gonna go fantastic fantastic sam um i have one fundamental question for you okay so this is something perhaps uh from what you're currently working on and building uh depending on your answer will significantly help the millions of people out there in the world that are looking to join this whole crypto ecosystem uh based on the things that we as engineers are building behind the scenes so there's two aspects right so when it comes to technology and adoption there's obviously uh the engineers that we are uh the software developers the market makers and everybody else who understands ",
        "19": "the the the difficult aspect of the tech and are building solutions that everybody else can actually consume right i mean if we look into google today when somebody actually wants to even the lame person in the far unreachable place in africa or in a third world country who actually happens to have a smartphone device with internet connectivity and wants to be able to search for something the first thing that comes to mind is google but you know when they go google they don't ask the question hey how the hell was google built right how ip protocol works so actually let's just go ahead and do my search so because you're working on the future the decentralized financial ecosystem of the future i'm envisioning a world where technology technical terms aren't necessarily actually part of the norm but i know one thing that if i need to do my banking if i ",
        "20": "need to do my market making if i need to do my my my trading activities if i need to invest i need to go on to a platform that actually responds to my personal needs for me to be able to invest right so how do you think in layman's terms for the person out there that has absolutely no quick conclusion of what d5 is and what the eccentric means how do you think that you are solving that problem to respond to these basically and i'm going to close it yeah i think that's a super important question and i think that like it's a question defy is up in a lot of ways i think you know i think that like in the end that has to be the answer is is the pitch can't be going to five billion people in the world and saying it's decentralized it's on chain it's trustless look at the number of validators that we have right like they don't give a and and you know you go to visa and you're like look it's on chain it's trust us and they're like look those are buzz words we don't know ",
        "21": "what they mean tell us how it will help our business or help our users and your users like tell me how it will help me invest or help me pay money or do remittances and like if you can cross that barrier then you can get people excited about maybe the decentralized nature or the technology but no one's going to want to use it if you can't make it a good product to use in the first place absolutely this would be the goal and what i would say to that is you know step one is building out the the underlying pipes of this building out the technology that can power it but then step two is packaging it in consumer facing products that are designed to be great to use and you know one way that sort of we've thought about this is like on on other sides like ftx and blockfolio where ftx it's if you if you want to spend five hours a day trading crypto i think ftx is a great product if you spend one hour dating it's a great product um if you want to spend 30 minutes a year investing in crypto you probably don't ",
        "22": "want to see the word trailing stop anywhere on on your site you probably don't want to see maintenance margin requirements or right or like you know and what you want to see is i want to buy 50 bitcoin how i how do i do that and so block folio it's like the it's gui is just like deposit your dollars or your you know aussie dollars or whatever currency you have and i buy that much bitcoin or ether or whatever you want and it's back ending on to ftx it's the same core technology in the back end powering it but the the gui that's displayed to people is instead of phrasing it in sort of native trading terms it's packaging it all together and making an easy intuitive you know investing uh interface and that's what needs to happen with d5 is that people need to then take these primitives right take the decks and instead of saying hey guys here's a dex here's where you can go get your decentralized wallet here's how you deal with your super keys yeah it said what they need to say it's like look here's the website you go here and you just log in and and then you can ",
        "23": "invest and it's back ending onto those same products but a huge part of this as you said is actually in the end building uis and rappers that make it make sense to most people makes sense to people who aren't crypto native who aren't defy native that's absolutely huge and you know hopefully map stop me will be one step in that direction as a mass consumer application that's gonna be you know just showing people hey click this button to earn yield on your assets but on the back end is using you know an on-chain prime brokerage protocol back ending onto a serum decks absolutely sam thank you very much lee for your contribution thank you "
