        "3": "customer assets they were inappropriately transferred from FTX and importantly we will hear how Mr Ray and his team are trying to recover funds for customers by piecing together bankman Freed's broken record keeping and by identifying potentially unlawful transfers to himself as well as his friends and family under my leadership over the past four years this committee has closely focused on the growth and popularity of crypto precisely because of the many concerns that the failure of FTX has highlighted last year I created a digital assets working group comprised of democratic members of the committee with the goal of learning more about the underlying Technologies applications for finance and the risk they pose to customers consumers and the economy when the president's working group on financial ",
        "4": "markets urged Congress to safeguard the economy from stable coin risk I and ranking member McHenry jumped into action and continue to work on a bill with the members of this committee the ongoing failures of crypto firms lack Terra USD Celsius blocked by and most significantly FTX and alamed to research only serves to strengthen the importance for Congress and the public to understand the harm cause to customers what laws have been broken or flaunted and how Congress and The Regulators can prevent this from happening again I want to say that I'm pleased that the committee's efforts have pushed enforcement agencies across the country to take greater action against Bad actors who misuse customers funds I also applaud the SEC for authorizing separate charges relating to Mr bank and freed and I look forward to additional actions ",
        "5": "to hold him accountable and make customers more whole again I yield back and I now recognize the ranking member of the community the gentleman from North Carolina Mr McHenry for five minutes thank you madam chair we've heard everything but the truth tweets DMS and interviews are no substitute for the facts and that's why Cheryl Waters and I work together to get this hearing on the books the first bipartisan hearing of this Committee in the last four years and we've worked together to invite two witnesses one Mr Ray is proven to be a reliable Witness second well um frankly I look forward to getting these lies here on the records under oath nevertheless the rest of Sam bankmanfried is welcome news but it still does not get at the bottom of what happened at FTX and why it happened and ",
        "6": "who else may be responsible we need to understand the flow of funds between FTX and Alameda research and the 130 related entities we need to examine the actions of those who may have contributed to what has been called a quote complete failure of corporate controls end quote uh that quote comes from Mr Ray the newly appointed CEO and we need to answer we need answers uh for the U.S platform customers stuck in limbo but our work here um that well our work doesn't stop there we have an obligation to do everything in our power to ensure this never happens again but let's face it there's an old saying there's nothing new Under the Sun and it's safe to assume that fraud and fraudsters I've been around just as long as that phrase has been around bangmon Freed's play is nothing new we've we've seen it before ",
        "7": "in the late 1800s when the Union Pacific purposefully inflated the price of Railway railroad construction to line its executive Pockets or in the 1900s when the con man George C Parker was arrested for a legally quote unquote selling the Brooklyn Bridge Madison Square Garden the Statue of Liberty and in the 2000s when it was revealed Enron engaged in a massive corporate fraud in corruption sending shockwaves throughout the business world uh there are many comparisons you can draw between each one of these Pretenders and the alleged actions of Mr bankman freed it appears to be the same old school fraud just using new technology but it's important to note and I think it's very important to know we still use railroads we still buy and sell real estate and we still rely on businesses to provide services we have to separate out the bad actions of an individual from the good created ",

        "11": "the FDX group's collapse appears to stem from absolute concentration of control in the hands of a small group of grossly inexperienced and unsophisticated individuals who failed to implement virtually any of the systems or controlled that are necessary for a company entrusted with other people's money or assets some of the unacceptable management practices have identified so far include the use of computer infrastructure that gave individuals in Senior Management access to systems that stored customers assets without security controls to prevent them from redirecting those assets storing of certain private keys to access hundreds of millions of dollars in crypto assets without effective security controls or encryption the ability of elementa to borrow funds held at ftx.com to be utilized for its own trading or Investments without any effective limits whatsoever the commingling of assets the lack of ",

        "15": "possible to investigate what happened formulate conclusions and hopefully inform the committee's work here I should note that my ability to comment on certain of the matters today will be inherently limited by the state of fdx's Records ongoing bankruptcy proceedings and of course the numerous ongoing investigations by the U.S law enforcement regulators I look forward to answering your questions to the best of my ability thank you again for allowing me to present in front of this committee thank you thank you very much Mr Ray it has been widely reported how FTX shifted customer funds held at the exchange to Alameda research which was a hedge fund owned almost entirely by Mr bankman freed this allowed the firm to effectively gamble with customer money uh without their knowledge or consent if FTX was registered as a Securities Exchange several laws would have ",
        "16": "required the segregation of customer assets and prevented such clear conflicts of interest Mr bankman freed also appears to have tried to hide the linkages between the exchange and his hedge fund have you seen evidence of such a cover-up have you seen evidence that there was any independent governance of Alameda separate and apart from that of the exchange foreign operations of the XTF group were not segregated it was really operated as one company uh as a result There's no distinction virtually between the operations of the company and who controlled those operations well Mr Ray ",
        "17": "another bankruptcy filing revealed that Mr bankman freed personally received one billion dollar a one billion dollar loan from Alameda research in a meeting with committee staff Mr bankman freed was unaware of the terms of the repayment interest details and could not confidently State who authorized the loan he claimed that he reinvested this money into the exchange but knowingly chose to have the loan issued to him rather than FTX to avoid directly connecting Alameda research to FTX can you elaborate on any significant findings in connection with this loan the the loans that were given to Mr uh had been freed uh were not just one loan it was numerous loans uh some of which were documented uh by individual promissory notes uh there's no description of ",
        "18": "uh what the purpose of the loan was in one sentence instance uh he signed both as the issuer of the loan as well as the recipient of the loan uh but we have no information at this time as to what the purpose or the use of those funds were and that is part of our investigation did you find any business or operational activities that the inter entities jointly engaged in that you would consider inappropriate are detrimental to FTX if so could you give us an example well certainly thank you uh the operation of uh valameda really depended uh based on the way it was operated for the use of customer funds that that's the major breakdown here of funds from ftx.com which was the exchange for uh non-us citizens ",
        "19": "those funds were used at Alameda to make investments and other disbursements did FTX have sufficient Risk Management Systems and controls to appropriately monitor any leverage the business took on and the interconnections it had with businesses lack again Alameda there were virtually no internal controls and no separateness whatsoever with that I'm going to um call on the gentleman from North Carolina Mr McHenry who is the ranking member of the committee you are now recognized for five minutes hey Madam chair Mr Ray uh thank you for your testimony um we had uh your predecessor Mr Sam ",
        "20": "bangman freed before this committee a year ago um and give give him where we are can we just start from the beginning um you having your declarations some clear outlines but I want to make sure we have this in the record uh there are different groups of businesses under the FDX FTX platform or umbrella your declarations separate the businesses into four silos we describe that yes uh for structural purposes and just for ease of presentation we tried to take the over a hundred entities and we put those in four silos to demystify that it's very simple there was a U.S Silo which was the FTX U.S exchange for U.S investors there was an International Exchange called ftx.com again for uh non-us persons that invested in crypto uh there was Alameda which is purely a ",
        "21": "crypto hedge fund which made other Investments Venture Capital type Investments and there's a fourth entity which was purely Investments and although our investigation is not complete uh those those Investments were most likely made with either Alameda money or money that originally came from fdx.com but that fourth Silo is just purely Investments and who owned those four silos all all those entities were you know owned or controlled by Sam bankman freed okay um and so can you describe the differences between theftx.com and FTX us Silas yes uh very simply you know FTX us was for U.S citizens who wanted to trade crypto uh ftx.com was for uh you know you know U.S citizens were not allowed to trade on that exchange uh that's very simple ",
        "22": "and I would make one other comment which is suffering apart from uh uh any of those two silos it was Ledger X which is a regulated entity regulated by the CF test TCC solve it and separate from the FTX U.S silo okay and that that is a distinct shot that's a distinct um company that was a distinct company within the U.S Silo yes okay so then Alameda research and the Venture Capital businesses what did Alameda reach research do I essentially made crypto Investments uh engaged in you know margin trading we took long and short positions in crypto essentially invested in crypto but of course we now know also invested in over five billion dollars of other assets which are in a variety of sectors and what was the practice between Alameda research and ftx.com do you have have you established any anything you can disclose to us today in ",
        "23": "essence you know Alameda was a user effectively a customer of fdx.com uh that's how it was essentially structured uh was that a distinct set of capital between those two uh companies well we now know the answer to that is no no okay and with the information you have right now when when approximately the FTX began to experience financial trouble uh well it was first disclosed uh to the public beginning around November 2nd uh but you know when this began it was months if not you know earlier years our investigation is is continuing this is but this is not something that happened overnight or in the context of a week okay uh so you you said the distinction between FTX usftx.com Alameda research what was a what was the relationship between ftx.com and FTX us was there a distinction ",
        "24": "between the two uh there was a public distinction between the two uh what we're seeing though is that the crypto assets for both ftx.com and for FDX us you know were housed in the same database it's called the AWS system which is just an acronym for Amazon web services it was all housed in the same Web format and is that distinct from alamitas um assets yes it is okay um so in in your testimony you said that there is quote an absence of independent governance throughout the FTX group end quote uh yet Mr bankman freed has said that quote he wasn't running Alameda or making decisions on the Alameda side end quote is this an accurate statement by Mr I I assume you're going to say your statement's accurate is Mr bankman Freed's statement accurate I I don't know the basis for his comment ",
        "25": "I will note that he owned 90 percent of Alameda so but you've seen that you've seen no distinction in governance between the two oh yeah absolutely not There's no distinction whatsoever uh the owners of the company could really run free reign across all four silos thank you for testifying the gentlewoman from New York Mrs Velasquez who is also the chair of the house committee on small business is now recognized for five minutes good morning Mr Ray you have learned you have had a long career working working on several high-profile bankruptcies most notable being the andron debacle Mr Ray you were recently quoted in the New York Times as saying you have never seen such a complete failure of corporate control and the level of this function was the worst you have ever seen can you expand on these statements and what you ",
        "26": "have seen since taking over a CEO to make such a remark yes thank you that comment uh it went to really uh you know one thing that we found which you know every case is different uh the challenges of every case is different uh the issue here that I was speaking to is I've just never seen an utter lack of record-keeping uh absolutely no internal controls whatsoever and uh of course this case is then made difficult in that context when you're dealing with technology Mr Ray a number of their directors in the FTX group are located in offshore jurisdictions will this complicate the efforts to retrieve the assets of those there is so why uh no I it I don't think it will complicated at all the various ",
        "27": "jurisdictions historically in bankruptcy and I've been in a number of cross-border situations uh the jurisdictions uh will cooperate with each other uh The Regulators and all these jurisdictions uh I think realize that everyone's there for a common purpose to protect the victims and recover assets for the victims of of these situations have how much have you been able to secure and where are most of these assets located uh we we've been able to secure you know over a billion dollars of assets uh We've secured those to uh cold wallets in a secure location uh it's an ongoing process though uh which uh which will will take you know weeks and perhaps months to secure all the assets our most Predators located in the U.S or foreign jurisdictions the the majority of the creditors uh ",
        "28": "trade through the.com Silo and are outside of uh this jurisdiction although there are some foreign customers that are on the U.S Silo uh and vice versa so it is my understanding you established four silos can you explain why you believe establishing this silos and taking this approach will maximize asset recovery recovery for creditors and do you think this approach could help determine what happened to the one billion dollars that has gone missing uh yes uh so one of the reasons why we set up the Styles the way we did was to First focus on you know the the FTX Silo for the US it's a relatively smaller uh trading volume uh fewer users uh it's truly meant you know to be for the U.S customers the.com Silo was really for uh for non-us ",
        "29": "customers so there's a logical reason why we separated those two out uh the Alameda fund well that's just the fun that you know that Drew resources from the exchanges so it's it's really separate it was not for customers per se it was just simply a hedge fund um as we here in Congress consider the possibility of legislation in this area what is the one thing that you have seen in your short amount of time at FDX that you will Air to us to keep in mind or is needed the most uh you know I I don't want to speak to to you know detailed regulations or make observations about regulations that's certainly not an area of my expertise however uh we're dealing with people's money and their assets and you know my basic observation is you need records you need controls and and you need to segregate people's ",

        "91": "had a lot of pushback from my friends on the other side I didn't hear them quite today pushing back as they normally do I'd love to see that um but again someone has to regulate this if it's going to exist don't you agree I certainly think there has to be you know more controls in this sector who's your regulate it I defer to this committee that Madam chair I yield my time back thank you thank you now the gentleman from Texas Mr Williams is now recognized for five minutes uh thank you madam chair and thank you Mr Ray for being here appreciate it there's been many comparisons that have been made as as people examine what happened to FTX and from Bernie Madoff to Enron it looks like this will go down as one of the largest frauds in history and Mr Au a unique perspective on the fact that you have worked on the Enron bankruptcy I'd be interested real quick if you talk a little bit real quick about uh how it ",
        "92": "Compares you got cut off in nearly time and I'd like to hear a little bit about that you know Enron was a you know as a really a different company uh you know as a the crimes that were committed there were a highly orchestrated uh Financial machinations uh by highly sophisticated people uh to keep you know transactions off balance sheets uh you know the this is really old-fashioned embezzlement this is just taking money from customers and using it for your own purpose not sophisticated at all sophisticated perhaps in the way uh they were able to sort of hide it from people uh uh frankly right in front of their eyes but this isn't this isn't uh uh you know sophisticated whatsoever this is just plain old embezzlement old school old school there you go uh it ",
        "93": "seems like uh uh freed has some interesting ideas on how you can stay relevant in the FTX world and even after stealing customers money and driving and coming into bankruptcy and I have read that he wants to be retained as an outside consultant and been very critical of your own appointment quite frankly into this position so after his arrest last night all of his wishes seem even more unlikely so what role if any should he play in FTX moving forward the role he's currently playing zero good uh you stated that FTX was a platform allowing for users to trade digital assets uh were users engaged in simple exchanges of assets or were users permitted to engage in leveraged complex transactions yes I'm sorry can you repeat your question sure uh you say that FTX was a platform allowing for users to trade digital assets were users engaged in ",
        "94": "simple exchanges of assets or users permitted to engage in leverage complex transactions yes okay you also stated that you have recovered over one billion dollars in assets can you give a description of the nature and type of assets you have recovered to date we've recovered uh over a billion dollars of crypto assets these are you know coins of various nature and we've secured those but that's been my primary focus we've certainly also secured you know our cash and all of our bank accounts the bank accounts were frozen we've got control over those counts with new authorized users which you know certainly includes myself uh but our main goal is to secure the cash and secure the crypto assets and that is an ongoing Venture okay thank you for being here and I you my time back thank you very much the gentleman from Guam Mr San Nicolas is now recognized ",
        "95": "for five minutes thank you madam chair Mr Ray thank you for being with us here today there's a lot of people following this trying to understand trying to understand what happened for a variety of reasons um of course your primary responsibility would be to to make sure that um the um creditors are made whole as well as depositors and everybody else who has a a stake in varying degrees within the company my first question is have we been able have you been able to pinpoint the specific cause for ftx's collapse I know that there's all kinds of stories about um loans to the owner and um no internal controls loans to Alameda commingling but is there is there a specific a specific trigger point or specific cause that has ",
        "96": "resulted in the FTX collapse you know I think I've described it it's really just the unlimited uh ability of those in control positions to borrow customer funds or take customer funds and then deploy them for their own use their use involved margin trading which is inherently you know risky um and uh of course they've spent enormous amounts of money beyond that but it's really the misuse of funds and it's as simple as that you know and you know on a large scale basis so what is what is the um the the big picture um balance loss as a result of this bankruptcy how much how much has FTX lost as a result of this we don't have exact numbers but we know several billion dollars you know in excess of seven billion in excess of seven billias so in excess of seven billion dollars we're saying that the um the sandbagman ",
        "97": "Freedom Company basically took or misallocated seven billion dollars and that's why the and that's why FTX has collapsed right so he so funds were taken from customers funds were invested trading losses incurred in Alameda and then funds were deployed it will never be you know valued at the same dollar amount there was over five billion dollars of Investments made uh certainly there's some value there and we'll try to get that value uh and sell those assets but oftentimes even when he made those sorts of Investments whether it was directly or through others in management sometimes you would do that really without any pro forma or any valuation um not really quite sure how some of the purchase price numbers were derived so it you know gives you a sort of worry obviously that the purchases were overvalued so there's a concern there as well so uh so Alameda Alameda lost seven ",
        "98": "billion dollars as a result of investment decisions and margin trading there's there's a there's a multitude of reasons that that cause you know the Gap in assets between the customer balances and and what's there today and what we hope to gain uh it can't be pinpointed just on on you know losses on trading activity the reason I'm asking and I'm just kind of narrowing it down because my time is expiring but it's important for us to very clearly understand what caused this collapse you know when we had the 2008 financial crisis and bear Stearns collapse and Lehman Brothers collapsed you know we could have gone in there and we could have pointed all these different reasons that could potentially have have contributed to it but the underlying reasons were there was a subparime crisis and a lack of liquidity in these respective institutions that allowed us to have a policy response a regulatory response to prevent that kind of thing from occurring in the future the FTX collapse right now is just FTX ",
        "99": "but are these lack of controls and are these environments that resulted in the FTX collapse are those still existing today and could the same thing happen in similar operations such as binance for example could they also engage in the same activities under the current regulatory regime and if things go wrong by the same outcome well sort of sort of just three points I'd make uh first of all I mean we are going to detail the sources and uses and what happened to all the funds that will tell us exactly you know how the losses were incurred some of those may be Lessons Learned some of them just you know frankly will just be payments that were made you know from other people's money it's it's uh it's just going back to my questions on Mr Ray yeah the circumstances that led to FDX has collapsed those circumstances still exist in the crypto space and can other companies collapse in a similar set of circumstances well certainly we've seized trading so won't happen in our company could it happen at other companies I can't speak to them because I don't know how each of ",
        "100": "these companies are operated obviously our company operated in a very distinct way that that led to losses but I think every company is different my time's expired gentleman from Arkansas Mr Hill is now recognized for five minutes I thank the chairman I appreciate you being here Mr Ray glad to have you before the committee and I want to thank the ranking member Mr McHenry and the chair chair waters for working constructively in the digital asset space over the past four years and I want to remind my colleagues that Mr McHenry talked about uh bond rip-offs in the railroad expansion in the 1870s and 1880s true Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac leading us down the Primrose Primrose path in the early 2000s on housing ownership in the secondary market and there were frauds and fraudulent actors but that didn't mean that we didn't want to invest in railroads in the United States for the history of the country and it didn't mean that we don't need a vigorous of single-family housing market ",
        "101": "and secondary Market in our country so let's not confuse the malfeasance and disgusting activity of FTX with the fact that we need a proper thoughtful regulatory oversight of digital assets and so I think chair Waters and ranking member McHenry 14 years ago this week Bernie Madoff was arrested and charged with operating the largest Ponzi scheme in American history its collapse injured 37 000 investors and late led to Major reforms at the Securities and Exchange Commission and their oversight and finrun bangman freed was arrested in the Bahamas last night in many ways the fall of FTX dwarfs that of Bernie Madoff with court filing suggesting that over 1 million creditors are somewhere in the Lurch in the FTX silos Americans were hurt and I want everyone listening to know in today's hearing that this is just the first step that Congress is taking in understanding what ",
