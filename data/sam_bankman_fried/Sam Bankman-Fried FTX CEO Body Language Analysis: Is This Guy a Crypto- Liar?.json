        "0": "foreign [Music] hey there welcome to the channel today we are joined by Gavin Stone again he's been here before what I like to do on this channel is to bring experts and do a little exploration of human behavior uh True Crime never know what we're going to come across and today we're covering Sam bankman freed and Sam fried is in a bit of hot water if you will he has managed to somehow lose billions and billions and billions of dollars in a short period so he's gone from being the darling of I'll say the Democratic party donating more money than anyone on the planet saved George Soros to well I don't even know if it's bankruptcy how are you doing today Gavin ",
        "1": "I'm good thank you I'm looking at introduction well I wanted to have you take a look at this video because you do body language statement analysis Etc and a lot of people invested in him and he's getting kind of a an imagery building right now and I saw on Twitter for example that Kevin Leary famously of shark tank is saying you know what I think I believe him so I want to put this to the test Gavin we're going to look at a little bit of uh video with him being confronted about a couple questions and I just want to see if he strikes you as believable okay so let's go ahead and take a peek here this is him at a conference put forth by I believe the New York Times being directly questioned on some of his points and you could tell ",
        "2": "he's maybe a little bit uncomfortable there at the moment just a little bit so here we go Sam help me with this um on November 7th you tweeted and then deleted a tweet that said quote FTX has enough to cover all client Holdings we don't invest client assets even treasuries we've been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be unquote you then deleted that tweet and literally just moments ago you told me it was on November 7th that things took a turn yep um you're telling the truth so all right was there anything in there in that just that wall is being read to him which by the way kudos to them because often when trying to view these things you have a situation where you'll hear a question being asked or you'll watch the person asking the question ",
        "3": "but you don't get to see the person who's being asked the question which is very very frustrating but here you actually got to see the question being asked but look at him reacting in the time is being questioned yeah that's brilliant I hate it when the camera comes from one to the other or switches between one and the other and you can't say the the actual points where they're asking the questions this was brilliant because from the moment he started asking the question you could see his mouth getting dry straight away he takes a a sip of his drink um there's little bits that are going on with you watching his entire body language and seeing him getting more and more uncomfortable and more closed in you can see his palms are getting sweaty and he's trying to put them on on his legs you can't see his hands but you know what he's doing um you know and he's kind of getting more closed in as he gets to the the point of answering the question um and then the beauty of this is uh you've poured it at the perfect time because with a question like that and ",
        "4": "when somebody finishes with what you try are you telling the truth there's one word you want to be listening for and that's yes simple as that yeah um you know yes or no you know it's a it's a yes or no question so you can expand on that but if you're not hearing the word yes something's very very wrong um I know that certain people have habits of starting answering the questions with the words well and with the word so if that's in their bass line and they they normally do it then you can write it off but if it's not in somebody's Baseline um and they start answering a question with the word so you know that um chances are they're trying to hide something or make something up in there and that's exactly what he uh started off answering with as soon as you paused it there so I will say however fair play to him for sticking himself in the firing line um I wanted to point out that whether you like this guy whether you don't whatever your beliefs are ",
        "5": "he's put himself out there and the hardest part for me he's obviously he's in a very nerve-wracking position he doesn't know what's going to be asked so the hardest part for me is distinguishing between nerves and deception so you know um but I did watch this at the beginning as well uh so he's had plenty of time to settle in and get used to things and get into a routine and get comfortable with the entire situation or at least get used to it so maybe a little bit of both but so far from what I've seen um he's definitely kind of squirming on the spot all right and the so is typically used again as a filler to buy some time like a good another good one would be uh can you repeat the question or so and then repeating the question back to the person and then while it's going scramble scramble scramble what am I going to come up with what am I going to come up with filtering heavily faster than words at ",
        "6": "any point and of course you know what you've bought yourself those extra three or four seconds it's giving you a hell of a lot of time to think and to come up with it even even just the start of an answer even if it's not the full answer so the bottom line is you should be saying yes well now I mean if I say to you Eric were you on Mars yesterday first are you high no okay in that case it might be like that one I would probably ask you again yeah yesterday oh okay if we're confused okay what were you in France yesterday no no no it's as simple as that it's all you need to know I think that's Mars because I didn't know you might have been in France as far as I know probably highly unlikely sometimes I could be almost people might think I'm on Mars my opinions could be from Mars that is true Which Way rhymes with the women are from Men Are from ",
        "7": "Mars women are for Venus um or and I don't know the order they put it but things were changing fast and you know when you look at at November 6th I was feeling nervous but I felt like things were probably going to end up okay we still had I mean you know assets way larger than liabilities and um uh and yet there is increasing withdrawals man but we were meeting all of it we were processing all of it although it was a weekend so we were a day delayed on a lot of wire transfers and stable coin creations and Bitcoin node was overloaded but you know their assets were a continued process by November 8th um I did not think the odds were that high that we were going to be able to meet all client demand and I was worried that there was going to be a substantial liquidity shortfall the the this feels to me like word salad yeah yeah so what you've got going on I've done it ",
        "8": "myself then I'll go so um so what you've got going on here is a couple of things uh he he kind of invited the question and he's trying to think of something to to kind of um convince more so than conveyors which is I love Lena Cisco's use of that terminology um so uh as long as convinced truth tell us convey and that's because the truth tellers don't need to convince you because they've got the truth on their side whereas obviously Liars they do have to convince you because they haven't so in this instance what he's trying to do is convince you of a story and say you know this was happening that was happening and if you noticed at first he's got a lot of nervous energy and again I know you can't see his leg but you can see his arm resting on his leg and you can see he bounced up and down like that you can see this band's going on his leg he's going uh like restless leg syndrome because he's got all that nervous energy caused from the adrenaline dumb because of what's happening and and what's going on around him so that's where that energy is getting used up I think it possibly comes away becomes aware of it and moves ",
        "9": "his hand off his leg maybe I'm not 100 sure um but what I do notice as he's gone into his kind of speech for like the word salad that you said all of a sudden it's come to him that he's got facts and figures and things you can say and and that there is a bit of a saying here in England if you can't blind them with science baffle them with beer yeah I didn't know whether you could say on this channel or not so and this seems to be what he's doing here um so it's kind of he knows you have another truth on each side so he's using all these facts and figures and again you'll notice when he started to to get into the swing of it he's becoming a bit more animated his hands are out here and he's you know making gestures and he's a lot more open with what he's talking about because he's a lot more confident in what he's saying because a lot of the things he's talking about the things he's familiar with but then when it comes back to being more direct about answering the question he is very much like this and very closed off again and ",
        "10": "very shrunk and I'm very still movement not much motion there not very open I think another word for the word salad as I called it is a chaff and redirect according to uh Greg Hartley and Scott Rouse yeah verbal vomit verbal spew Chuck and redirectors there's loads of different slang terms for it you can take your pick I think was it was it I think it was Mark Bowden that come up with the term um word salad wasn't it it might have been uh word sounds an old term I don't know you know it could be used as application but word salad is just out there like any politician that blathers or or whatever it's like he's just sounding smart the guy probably is a talented programmer and he goes into full nerd to confuse people like I'm just saying they're listening to and getting lost in the rhythm of what he's saying and you know the funds were here and and that's a deliberate thing because I've done like a a geek talk or nerd talk or ",
        "11": "whatever programming and you can do that you can just go deep into the technical and realize you're actually not seeing anything you're just laying out a whole bunch of uh technical terms that people are afraid to confront you and ask you a direct question because then they'll be perceived as dumb so it is a powerful method to escape from scrutiny me if you will oh definitely it works is fantastic and again with that you'll notice when he started he was very clunky with his speech a lot of urns a lot of uh there's a lot of well I I and and then eventually when he got into the swing of it like you said when he got into the technical terminology that he was using uh his speech sped up he was talking a lot faster there was a lot more it was just a lot more rhythmic in general he knew what he was on about the most confident in what he was saying but the the clinic speech doctor once once he got himself on on track as it was yeah perfect ",
        "12": "process by November 8th um I did not think the odds were that high that we were going to be able to meet all client demand and I was worried that there was going to be a substantial liquidity shortfall November 7th that we started the transition day and you know even just to start versus the end of November 7th I felt I felt fairly different um [Music] a lot of distancing language too right like um somebody instead of saying no I did not kill the child I would never hurt the child he's saying I didn't feel confident or that instead of saying our ass was in the sling we are out of money he's like we didn't feel as confident and things like that do you feel the same the little statement analysis in there yeah so this is this is what like what I kind of refer to as the kind of the customer service speech ",
        "13": "um this is where um you know your customer service is representative is going to say something like I'm not confident I can make that happen on time instead of saying I'm saying no way is that going to happen we are so deep in the stuff that it is not going to happen sorry about that um so what they do is they give this kind of you know smoothed off version and this is what he's doing here um he's not turning around and saying I came in I had a look at the figures and went Whoa We are deep in it um I'm gonna need a snorkel he he's kind of basically turned around and said you know uh yeah I wasn't feeling confident you know blah blah blah and again if you notice this entire time um I I should have pointed it out last time from the minute he was asked were you telling the truth the whole of the way through is there going well I didn't feel confident that I had quite above I've exaggerated a little bit when I'm doing it but he's shaking his head from side to side and you don't need to be a genius to figure out what that means [Music] ",
        "14": "you know and uh I can't remember exactly what I was thinking or or or when I said that but you know I remember trying to think about feeling conflicted about what to say and trying to think about what I could say that I believed and um you know by by not that long later I no longer believed that I no longer that no longer felt like it had much like that was a a at all reasonable representation of where my mind was at and uh I don't remember exactly the word is LIE there's a lie um there you go have you ever seen an infant in in a caught in the act of something and you go to them what were you doing with your hand in the cookie jar and they go uh there was a cook and there was a jar in the kitchen we're in the kitchen and then the house and then from the food starting with the time with my brother oh did I tell you my brother went over ",
        "15": "here exactly and and this is this is pretty much what he's doing there one of the things I also noticed as well um a couple of times you said I was trying to think about how I felt about that um I I never in my life have I needed to try to think about how I felt about that and then to try to think about something else would you followed up straight with again I tried to think about and I don't need to try to think it kind of happens naturally from the minute I open my eyes um and I certainly don't need to try to think how I feel about something you know it's something that you know if you ask me um well no how do I feel about um crime I can say well I feel it's wrong well it's it's funny they're trying to think about how I felt about that is writing your testimony in the future yeah what you're doing is you're trying to think of the story of how I felt about that versus because sometimes you do go how do I feel about that and that's ",
        "16": "legitimate because you know it's like something just happened and you're like that was odd am I sad or angry I don't know I'd say you can't think of it but but trying to think about yeah exactly it's like especially when it's something that's in the past tense yeah you can you can turn around and you can say something like you know there was loads of money lost and I felt you know just wanted panicked afraid of what it whatever emotion you want to put in there fill in the Gap but you can't turn around and say you know I was watching this it happened and trying to think how I felt about it right or on that note to go one back at you with Mark Bowden you might have been around when he was doing a commercial for a little known company called Nike when he came running through the stadium as a Streaker and if if you were to be sitting there and a Streaker suddenly ran by you naked with their bits flopping in the Wind that is a perfect example of ",
        "17": "I'm not sure what I think about that you know there would be a pause it's like is it a surprise is it a laugh are you embarrassed for yourself for them that's it you'd be like what's going on yeah you want to take a moment to pull stuff but yeah I mean you know with his his speech there there's a lot of things going on all over the place there's a lot of lip compression and licking of the lips as he's talking probably got a little bit of a dry mouth um again a lot of this could be put down to nerves because of what he's doing and the questions he's answering and the pressure that he's under but at the same time there are too many clusters not enough consistencies and and definitely not enough in the way of straight answers so you know so far the guy's got more red flags than a Russian airport uh and I will be a little bit concerned about uh um entirely honest all right ",
        "18": "I no longer that no longer felt like it had much like that was a a at all reasonable representation of where my mind was at and uh I don't remember exactly when I deleted but I remember at some points like that shouldn't be there let me ask you a different question because this is all around the same time uh the New York Times reported uh that uh 515 million dollars was suspiciously in quote trans uh transferred oh that's a very big smile for a thing that happened that was quite disastrous yes and let me leave that up there for a minute this is the Showcase smile folks this is the the Jack Nicholson in The Shining look technically I'm gonna say there could be a Scotia of duper's delight in that smile you think Gavin um I'm not saying that there was Criminal Intent for definite but to be ",
        "19": "fair a little bit of white face paint red lipstick and green hair dye and he would probably be somewhere on the lines of like the the Batman villain Batman villain uh live going on there um foreign I've been kind of looking at this replaying it several times and thinking could this be put down to a nervous smile and the answer every time that I come back um there's too much going on there for that to be a nervous one a nervous smile it would be a lot more fleeting and I know a duper's delight smile is fleeting but another smile would also show that the the nerves on his face not Delight so nervous one is like you know you can see that somebody's still nervous when their mouth Twitches is that there he looks like he's just been told he's won the the the Tri-State Lottery yeah this smile right here is what brought this whole thing about people ",
        "20": "sent this to me and said you got to look at this you gotta look at this guy and I shared it immediately With You Gavin but uh that that's The Shining Moment what started the whole thing and what I love too is he's doing that little Peak thing yeah I mean he's heads down it's kind of like a little like the kid you're talking about did you feel the cookies but yeah he can't help himself on that oh there we go so we'll get that moment live again transfer it from FTX while it's after after yeah the bankruptcy filing and there have been accusations that this is the assistance effectively of theft where did that money go and then again again like a child home oops Yeah I even that the word theft that was a the little micro expression yeah ",
        "21": "um yeah the whole time he's kind of looking down he looks up at the smile with the missing 515 million um I mean sorry was it fun 515 billion wasn't it oh no no no it wasn't but it was yeah yeah it was dozens of billions yeah it was it's so much it's staggering money more money than you and I will ever see or consider yeah it's a lot of money to lose and it's not like you've lost it down the back of the couch um we're not talking small numbers here you know he's not left it in the center console of his car this has been deliberately moved from a place to another place you know and somebody knows about it and if it's his company well he he bloody well shouldn't really shouldn't he you know um I get people make mistakes but that's a pretty big mistake so but yeah you're right with it I mean if you again you look at the body language again there's very closed off ",
        "22": "he's very looking down he's very kind of you know uh guarded as shall we say um I'm not showing any signs of being open or willing to wanting to share is after your thoughts at this point yep and there have been accusations that this is the assistance effectively of theft where did that money go so uh I will copy out this by saying at that point I was being cut off from systems and so I'll I'll give you the answer to the extent that I know it um which is that I believe that a few different things happened within a short period there um I think that uh the uh us team took actions to seize some of the assets and put it in custody um um we're back to the word salad again yeah and distancing language all at once yeah so ",
        "23": "we've got that clunky speech again from the beginning uh we've got the the very much distancing language I mean everything from the start of when he started talking again there's that word so from the very beginning rather than him coming in and and going straight for an explanation he's gone so um I will caveat that with um and again this is unless there is a really kind of complicated compound question that you have to answer there's no need to caveat something you know it's it's a reasonably simple question where did the money go it shouldn't need to come here they should be able to say you know this is where it went you know if he doesn't know he should be able to say I don't actually know you know and and he'd give his reason why but he shouldn't need to put a caveat in before he's even started talking at this point so that's one thing again um you will notice that he does his hand class thing again and and he's kind of ",
        "24": "putting his um hands between his legs very small movements very Frozen movements he's not back to his animated confident self again um so again he's kind of thinking very carefully while he's buying himself those seconds with that clunky speech uh and yet again no direct answer all right well that's you know what that's perfect I want to put it out to all of you what do you think do you believe him are you like Kevin Leary and you believe the kid quote unquote or are you like Gavin and me and I wouldn't give this guy money to go buy me a burger from the store please let us know down below and we'll see in the next video "
