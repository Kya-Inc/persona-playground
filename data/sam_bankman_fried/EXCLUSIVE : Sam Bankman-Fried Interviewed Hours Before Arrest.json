        "0": "hello hello oh hey hey Sam do you hear me I can hear you now yes all right great um so yeah thanks for joining today uh obviously talk about uh I know that uh a lot has happened in these last uh several weeks or so and uh and you've gone out of your way to to speak out and try to piece together um exactly what transpired um what you knew when uh what could have been done to potentially prevent this and we're going to touch on some of that today too but but I also want to kind of dive a little deeper as well into sort of what this says about the crypto industry as a whole and in particular some of the the centralized entities that play important parts of it so I'd like to just Begin by by asking for you to kind of give a little bit of perspective here uh it's been I guess about five weeks since all of this started it's been a little bit over a month since you resigned as as CEO uh what have you learned I mean what is your um yeah I'll just leave it there ",
        "1": "uh well I've learned a lot um I've learned a lot of things I this shouldn't have been what it took for me to learn um even if it if it was um I have reflected a lot on uh what happens when I get shitty um on what happens when I start to become less grounded when I start to lose focus and lose uh concentration on a lot of important things um I've reflected a lot on like people that were hurt by this and on what I can do to try to go some distance towards making part of it up um and I've reflected somewhat on what it means for the crypto ecosystem and what what I certainly wish I had done differently we've done differently as a business and you know what that means ",
        "2": "maybe other people could do too and I think like you know a uh really huge focus on transparency on things working exactly as they intuitively should and as they say they do um having large amounts of data that are easily available and consumable by customers representing all the core risk metrics um having uh you know as many panels of transparencies you can on as many windows of the business as you can both because customers deserve that and because frankly um that helps I think that would have helped um keep me more in touch with what was going on as well um and I think they're doable things I think they're achievable things I think in a lot of ways with some really giant and important exceptions ",
        "3": "um there were a lot of powerful things about what we've built about FTX obviously I [ __ ] that all up is there anything in particular specific learnings that you've come across again I know you've been asked this many times and and you often say you wish you had access to more data your access to systems was was cut off but I know you've been working the phones I know you've been talking to people I'm sure you've been laying up at night looking at the ceiling wondering what the hell happened uh is there anything in particular that you've learned since then that sort of helps kind of put the pieces together a little bit more to some extent and I don't have total confidence in it but I have I have a map in my mind of of roughly what I think happened and um you know what are the biggest mistakes there are a lot of ways to view them um and I had to screw up a lot of things for this to happen and um you know a lot of exogenous things ",
        "4": "had to happen it's um but you know going through a few of those that that I now think were um you know were deeply relate to what happened um you know one piece of this is thinking about hedging um uh I think Alameda had a substantially long Market position on I think that position was you know the percentage Leverage level if it was not very large a year ago even if those just because the value was so big then um uh and I it was not sufficiently hedged um I don't think it was close to sufficiently hedged and um I think that that uh left it vulnerable in a world in which there was a change in economic environment uh which we saw uh with you know interest rates Rising um money tightening quite a bit uh uh borrowers quite cutting quite a bit and risk assets falling ",
        "5": "um I think his second thing was you know the classic story of the uh sort of idiosyncratic market crash that specifically targets assets that one party holds um you know that's what happened with long-term Capital Management what happened in other cases and it happened here as well and and part of that means that even when alumin did have a bunch of Hedges on I think later this year um those didn't do very much in the crash in early November because it wasn't a broad-based market crash it was a specific crash in assets that Alameda held and some of the specific hedging positions that Alameda had because one one thing that I think most people find frustrating about this Market is how highly correlated it is and yeah and we've learned time and time again that trying to put on positions to offset risk might displace it a little bit or or really just does not actually do what it's intended to do so so what were some ",
        "6": "of those positions so uh I don't have the exact ones before me but I think basically you know combination of like very liquid crypto assets very liquid real world uh assets like you know basically things you know uh top top tokens uh you know stock market indexes um was I think basically was comprised of and you know to give like some I'll see if I can pull up these numbers here but you know over the uh you know over the first few days of November you saw a you know 50 to 90 percent uh decrease in you know the price of the assets that Alameda held and you know something like a you know zero to fifteen percent decrease in the price of the hedges that it had on um and so it didn't come close to hedging uh you know that risk and that was something that you know was another risk that I think was ",
        "7": "substantially underestimated of you know idiosyncratic Market moves that that don't uh look like traditional broad you know broad-based economically or monetary policy driven Market moves but are in fact related to you know the company itself um so that was you know one of the problems um uh you know another problem is like I just like you know there are things that at FTX we built out really good dashboards for views for um you know tooling for uh you know spreadsheets that monitored um and you know volume is one of those like you know volume by by client by you know jurisdiction by a lot of other things um we didn't have that for risk we didn't have that for like position risk um we'd have that for you know margin risk uh we should have that would have uh probably flagged a lot of what happened um a lot uh more clearly ",
        "8": "um and I mean in retrospect obviously we should have had that like in retrospect you know I mean we're applying for a cftc license and building out lots of systems for that um which would have helped here quite a bit frankly do you think that Alameda uh specifically was was targeted I I know that um you've said in some recent interviews that there was a concentrated PR campaign against you yeah I think it was I think it absolutely was now I also think that's not that much of an excuse because like you know I absolutely should not have allowed FTX to get into a position where it was vulnerable like that that was a huge huge mistake on my part um but I do also think it was the case that uh that there is a you know targeted attack okay one thing that I do I am curious about because you've also said multiple times that you kind of ",
        "9": "feel that you've become you became ungrounded uh that uh um I mean you started buying uh naming rights to stadiums and and sports teams and uh and I guess a proposed 100 million dollar sponsorship deal with Taylor Swift which uh led to some jokes that she has better due diligence than uh than some some VCS and institutional investors that's a different story but I I am excuse me I am curious too because you are an effectively altruist I I assume that you still are and you very publicly adopted the role of earning to give and yep it seems like for that to excuse me it seems that for that type of role you need to have very strong discipline so that if you actually are successful at earning you you you keep it long enough to do the giving and yeah I'm I'm just wondering how you think do you think that these different delineated roles in that this type of Silicon Valley philanthropic type of approach is is achievable um or like how like how ethical is it to ",
        "10": "try to make money in as much as you can in almost any way possible it's putting a lot of trust into into those people that they're going to end up doing the right thing and and not taking on too much risk I think the devil's in the details there and like I think it is doable I think it can be a model that's incredibly effective and good for the world um for that to be the case you have to not screw it up and I it's I I don't think it's a failure in the high level model I think it's a failure in my implementation and I think like that that that's entirely on me and and and as you said like it's it's this this didn't serve anyone well this this was bad from everyone's perspective and and obviously most of all from customers perspective um but I I but like you know I didn't make out well from this like the causes eyes ",
        "11": "supporting didn't like this is this is just a this is a failure on on every front Okay so I I do want to ask uh because you've also been very public about sort of your uh uh helps it your the way chapter 11 is is going forward um you've you've um mentioned that you like for instance FTX U.S you consider to still be fully uh liquid and solvent and then could um turn on withdrawals tomorrow if if they wanted to um yeah I'd like to get your overall assessment of of how the current leadership is is Prosecuting this but but also I am curious too that I mean you you've said multiple times that you really do not have a handle of the financials of the company and what money was where and and who owned what so assuming that magically you got implemented back into CEO as as tomorrow do you think you you would be better at ",
        "12": "trying to unwind the company than than John Reyes or I mean what how would you be better at this than than a trained and experienced team of of Executives that specialized in this very thing I totally hear you and so giving a few and there are a few things going on there um the first is you know how are things going today I mean I don't know for sure and obviously maybe there are great things beyond that I'm not seeing like that that's obviously a possibility um I can tell you from my perspective from what I've seen um I've heard from many people that there are a lot of really great people um who are working on the chapter 11 team right now who are putting in long hours to try as hard as they can to do what's right here and I'm incredibly grateful for that and for them um and for them taking on this responsibility here um I think it's it's uh you know uh yeah ",
        "13": "it's like I think that's great from every perspective they also have a really hard job um because they're you know inheriting a company which is is a really complex company is a global company um and you know trying in short order um to understand you know all of it and um and piece it together um and they're doing that as far as I can tell without any of the help or support of any of the people um who knew how the company worked um and that's that's not just a a herd challenge that's an impossible challenge um I don't think that needs to be the challenge I think there are ways to work constructively together um where you know I've seen statements made in filings of the form like you know XYZ didn't exist where it absolutely did exist so I wouldn't know how to get it so I mean you know you look at things like you know a record of the top 50 customers um that would have taken me you know 90 ",
        "14": "seconds to get um that that's not like you know there are a number of of things that have appeared in filings are uh you know data requests that are I just not hard to piece together from the context of like you know the team that knows that company well um but I think if if you're missing that context it's it's incredibly hard um and if you're missing that context and shut down all servers and data um that that sort of like ties your hands behind your back further um and so I think this is like certainly not the easiest version of that that you know could have been done and I think that that has frankly been detrimental and I think that's led to a much clunkier process than needed to be and I don't think this is the fault of most of the people who are a part of it because they they got thrust into this um I the chapter elephant filing I I ",
        "15": "think was uh problematic from a number of perspectives in the first place um and I was uh done on a an unreasonable time scale unreasonably fast um and I beared some responsibility for that absolutely um so sorry to interrupt but I mean you were the controlling shareholder in FTS right nobody um could actually force you to resign or file if you didn't want to right you've said that you've gotten some bad advice in the past I mean what was the deciding factor um so that late at night 4 30 in the morning you finally clicked yes and decided to file okay so two things the first thing you'll notice I did not file for chapter 11. um I did um I put uh mystery in charge of some of the businesses ",
        "16": "um but I did not at any point believe it was appropriate to for instance have FTX Us in chapter 11. that's a fully solvent company that never should have been I was not expecting it to be um I'm surprised at how that ended up um I'm confused um I but in terms of why I did what I did I mean I I certainly regret how I did it I think it was on an incredibly messy process and I think it it uh was not thought out well I was under a lot of pressure to do it I was getting a large number of messages that were um I felt at the time and think now um fairly I inappropriate manipulative um uh but fundamentally like I shouldn't have been susceptible for that like I should have I should have been in a position where I was able to uh you know ",
        "17": "navigate that for myself um and uh I think frankly like it was a really stressful situation I got some very bad legal advice um can you share who I mean these pressures This legal advice who actually um who actually applied that pressure I mean who who was the the winning voice here for you I well I think you can look at who ended up um directing what happened um you know after the filings and I I think that um I think frankly there were a lot of lawyers involved in that process probably too many lawyers I didn't I don't know there's some things I didn't know until uh well after I didn't realize until fairly recently that in the Enron bankruptcy um I I guess the total legal fees charged of the estate by the by various ",
        "18": "lawyers were I think 700 million dollars or so um I I think that like um I you know I can't speak to motives but um uh but there were some law firms uh whose names I'm not gonna name right now that certainly gave me very bad advice that certainly reneged on agreements that were explicitly made um in ways I don't know to be legal um and I certainly acted in quite bad faith there again I say all this but like it's on me that I [ __ ] that up let me ask you this did any lawyer signals that you may face or less legal Jeopardy if you were no longer CEO if if you resigned did Europe yeah factor into that um some people said that that was the case I generally responded by saying that that wasn't what I felt like mattered the most there and that that ",
        "19": "was that was not the right thing to be focusing on um but I I but I guess at the end of the day um I I got a lot of pushback on that and I mean I I asked myself a lot why I cared about that pushback um you know a lot of the pushback was that this wasn't the right thing to do for customers necessarily but that I was dumb to think about that and that I should just be thinking about myself that never felt right to me um I different people are taking different approaches um the arguments were all over the place for me to do it um and ultimately it's basically all coming from a series of a tighten it group of lawyers in law firms that were coordinating with each other I believe on that messaging to me um but I but I think you know I'm not even sure they were locally right on their claims and I also continue to think that that's not what mattered here ",
        "20": "and What mattered here was like whatever had the best chance of making customers whole okay one last question on this and then we'll we'll move on I'm just curious um what advice your parents were giving you during um during these few days you know mostly they were trying to be supportive as best they could and support what I ended up you know support what I did whatever it was and you know um I mean they've been putting incredibly difficult position here through no fault of their own um and yeah I'm I don't know grateful for the support they've given um but at the end of the day they weren't pushing me one way or the other any any legal advice or or was it mostly just support it was mostly support and and Council and um I uh yeah okay so one of the details that that you've you've shared is that I think it was something like eight minutes after you signed the papers you ",
        "21": "got a multi-billion dollar uh funding offer uh I I love it if you could share the names of any of these these companies or funders that that offered to help recapitalize the firm I don't have permission to do that I'm gonna see if I can get that permission um I don't currently have it but uh but yeah I did get that um and I mean frankly I gotten multiple multi-billion dollar um seemingly fairly serious funding proposals um um including multiple since after the crash um and many you know are multiple since after the filing and many after the crash but before the chapter 11 filing oh no go for it I was just going to ask can you share if they were Uh current investors or new sources of capital I I mostly mostly they are not Uh current ",
        "22": "investors obviously is talking to a lot of current investors but most of it was news sources okay and just to maybe just get a little more detail if we can on what some of these were yeah yeah what were they looking was this an equity investment was this some sort of debt instrument uh how much Equity were they looking for or what role would you have in the company like were these offers contingent on you staying a CEO or leaving a CEO so I there's a variety but I think the most typical type of offer was something like a convertible um I think like the most typical type was something like you know debt in the company which would convert to equity under various circumstances um and I mean they're fairly favorable to the investors as is appropriate there um you know this is a a case where we were uh Bakers can't be choosers so to speak um and in terms of you know myself like ",
        "23": "I I can't speak for them but you know if I had to get a sense of where most of them were at I I think what I would say is that most of them were envisioning a world in which I was still involved with the company and I was still um helping and I was still pushing forward but in which there is also more oversight um than there had been before and that there was you know much more transparency that there were more people over you know checking what was going on um and so you know I to my knowledge I think that that's what most of them were looking at scenarios where you know I was involved but with heavy oversight when you say involved do you think that means as a CEO or as perhaps like more like an Adam Newman type of deal with wework where he negotiates a a favorable sort of uh golden parachute and I don't think it would be the latter um I you know I I think it wouldn't be a lot for multiple reasons ",
        "24": "um um but uh but I I I you know in terms of titles I don't know and titles have never been what I've cared about in the first place um I you know they're just words at the end of the day um but it's a good question and in many cases it wasn't discussed in some cases it was discussed and left unclear um and you know if I had to sort of you know I I don't know like I think some variants on this were like you know that I have some senior role they're not just an advisory roll a real role but that there is at least one person with a role that has oversight of my role um and different people have different formulations of that and um you know there are a lot of ways you can construct that one very public offer that came was from from uh CZ at binance do you think that his offer um was legitimate no no I don't think it ever was I ",
        "25": "obviously helped you for sure but so I mean well looking back on it like there were a lot of signs that um that uh this was maybe not a Bonafide offer um one is he carried surprisingly little about her terms um it's just like yeah you know sort of like yeah billion here a billion there who cares on what the terms of it were which you know maybe you could take as a sign that he wasn't expecting those terms to matter um and uh and I also think it just sort of like fits with you know in general what I think his approach was here and so I I don't know for sure maybe I'm wrong um but I it I did not get the impression that it was bona fide and I mean we found out that they were uh pulling out via their tweet uh about it uh we were not separately informed of that if if you didn't think that it was legitimate I know you've said Beggars can't be choosers and you were in a dire ",
        "26": "circumstance but why did you um why did you sign the LOI uh could that have potentially turned off some of these other suitors that you may have been speaking with at the same time yeah maybe I shouldn't have um at the time I was hopeful that it was real and uh a lot of people really want it to happen um and I felt like it was worth a shot and we gave it a shot we gave it a really good faith effort you know we tried as hard as we could that day to get as much information as we could and to be as Cooperative as we could um uh in retrospect was it just a waste of time talking to them yeah probably once this time we spoke with Carolyn Ellison oh it's I think it's been like a month I'm I'm curious because there is a feeling out there uh even though CZ has denied it that he kind of played you I mean that um the FDT leverage uh it was part of a ",
        "27": "plan to to sync FTX I'm I'm curious your thoughts on that and also I'd love to get a reaction from you when when Carolyn mentioned that she she tweeted at CZ that she would buy any amount of ftt from them at twenty two dollars a token uh what did you think did you realize that she perhaps showed her hand with with that tweet so um so in terms of uh the CZ angle obviously I can't know for sure but like my guess is he he he played me he played it well I think he probably did better than he thought he would like I don't think he thought this was going to be the outcome I think he thought it was gonna be damaging but not this damaging I don't know I'm guessing he's happy that it was oh I can't know that for sure um I but uh but he played it quite well over the last couple months like I uh in real time was seeing what he was doing ",
        "28": "um but was not I was not good at predicting what his next moves were going to be and um uh he had a far more carefully thought out plan I think than what I originally thought he would have and um I was I think well constructed um and obviously quite effective um I you know in terms of showing the hand with the tweet I don't know it wasn't how I interpreted it but like obviously other people didn't interpret it the same way I did so um uh maybe like my thought I was just like that's the efficient thing to do like it's you know if CZ says look he's worried about the impact of selling this out then just do an OTC trade like it's a lot cleaner um and I think there's a little bit of calling his bluff on that um because I think if he actually did just want to sell out in an efficient market way he should have really liked that OTC trade idea um and I think the fact that he didn't ",
        "29": "was maybe some evidence that uh the pr impact was the goal what do you make of some of these allegations that have come out that you were shorting tether that you were trying to manipulate the price of Luna in an effort to save the company it's [ __ ] ridiculous I mean look I [ __ ] up a lot of things like I just absolutely did and I deserve a lot of [ __ ] for that and I I'm like I mean yeah it sucks I I feel incredibly bad about all that but also like you know I I I there are a lot of things I didn't do as well like I you know these sort of Open Season right now for conspiracy theories and like the shorting tether thing is ridiculous is is a five hundred thousand dollars uh 250 000 maybe short position something like that uh that was claimed to be um I I me trying to tank the price of tether ",
        "30": "and there's so many things wrong with that theory like first of all 250 000 is nothing to the price of tether uh obviously and I would know that second of all I wasn't even doing any of this I was like only even vaguely where anything was happening third of all why would I want to be tanking the price of tether that makes no sense like I think the claim is I want to tank the price of tether in order to tank crypto prices that seems like nine in the right direction like I I I don't even get the theory for why I want to be doing that let alone like actually doing it then um and like I had so many things going on that day like boy did I not have the brain space to even try and come up with like a wacky plan you know let alone the fact that I wouldn't do that and didn't want to and it wouldn't be effective and didn't make sense and you know I think right now it's just like people have realized that they can get clicks for saying mean things about me and like yeah I deserve that in general but like I I sort of wish that it stuck more to ",
        "31": "the things that I actually did screw up and not like uh you know not just like random ass like problems with the world or or non-existent problems with the world that are like being retroactively blamed on me with no evidence okay so I I want to um just move forward a little bit I I want to talk a little bit about ftx's approach to to regulation and yeah compliance and I I just one of the statements I think he gave it to George Stephanopoulos that you spent zero time doing compliance and risk management um it was really kind of kind of stunning and I'm hoping you can maybe just shed a little bit more like I mean in a survey response that um that your legal team gave to us back in back in August uh we know that you have a 72 person compliance team yeah what were they ",
        "32": "doing like how and how did more of that funnel up to you well so I did spend a bunch of time on compliance I think I did not on risk management and um I think like you know I was spending a lot of time thinking about regulation and thinking about how to apply with regulations and thinking like I was very heavily involved actually on that side of things now there's an enormous amount going on also because there are 200 jurisdictions in the world and so there are a lot of things that like other people were doing it well and I was not involved in on the compliance side um but but I was putting a lot of time in there but risk management I was not putting much time at all into did any Regulators ever ask about margin positions on the exchange or or how you uh how you keep track of that so I think it's and I don't know the details of this but I think in some jurisdictions we had reporting actually around that um where we would give ",
        "33": "um I don't know if it's daily or or some some sorts of periodic reports to the local Regulators of um is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction it's just like you know it's different it's different in each country but in some countries uh yeah we did have reporting requirements there and and I think frankly that those may have come out better than other jurisdictions I I haven't done like a super careful survey of that but I I do think that like there is potentially value to that and that that that's a healthy thing and something that frankly um I think kept um I kept you know the exchange in those jurisdictions um more I I environment's not quite the right word but um uh you know force it to be on top of its [ __ ] um uh but it was not in general the question that we got a ton of like it came up in some jurisdictions but it ",
        "34": "frankly wasn't the type of thing that we got asked about the most like um were the ones that were yeah so I mean there's a lot of like random regulations in different jurisdictions that would come up which just didn't even have analogs in other jurisdictions um and so you know questions of like you know what the notification process is for a margin call is like I think that mattered for some jurisdictions um questions about a lot of questions about the freezing of various things like if you use this word then it counts as marketing but if you use this other word it doesn't like that's the kind of thing that would come up a lot and so like there'd be questions of like was a product being marketed or advertised in a particular way or jurisdiction or was it being passively discovered and we spent like an absurd amount of time ",
        "35": "um I'll get to that stuff in one second because I do want to ask about it but strictly related to to to margin because that seems to be the Crux of everything yeah absolutely can you share which jurisdictions were the ones that required like regular reporting on on margin positions so the ones that I'm aware of are well the United States with FTX us derivatives and I believe Japan as well um and there may be one or two more I'm not confident um I know we had some reporting in Australia don't know the details of it um uh but I I am certainly aware that in you know fk2s derivatives did and I believe FTX Japan did to the jfsa as well um I will note that uh I believe that FTX U.S derivatives in fact all of FTX is fully solvent and fully backed and all customers could withdraw tomorrow that were allowed by The Operators of the extinct um and that fgx Japan I also believe ",
        "36": "um to be fully solvent and I have funds necessary to make all Japanese customers whole um as well okay was there ever a discussion about because clearly I mean you've said again previous interviews your dashboards really focus more on trading volume and revenue but clearly you built these products at least for some entities to be able to keep their finger on the pulse of of margining was there ever a discussion about applying it to the wider company so okay that's a really good question because obviously the answer kind of should be yes like certainly when you phrase it that way like I I feel like obviously I should be saying yes like I should be living in a world where yes is the answer I give to that um uh I'm not sure I'm actually living at that world though and to give maybe a little more color on that and how like how ",
        "37": "could we end up in that position um so there were an enormous number of things that we did for regulatory purposes just like a huge huge swath of things and um many of them frankly were kind of dumb like many of them served no clear purpose kind of the world um and I we just had to do them and some of them were actually like clearly counterproductive like we would sometimes have to like there'd just be like some weird regulation in some country that like you have to liquidate a user under conditions X Y and Z even though that user was way above water and like no reason to liquidate them it's like ah it's a third Wednesday I mean it's obviously not quite that dumb but like there there were things that that made no sense and then there were a ton of things that were just like fine like nothing was wrong with them except that they were just slightly different than ",
