        "0": "the first Network interview with Sam bankman freed the founder of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX and George we know that you travel down to the Bahamas in that Penthouse that he said and used to work with his former colleagues at FTX now alone with his parents and Rob and this was really something a wild interview almost two hours we sat down it felt at times like a therapy session he took every tough question he wanted to speak out about all the questions surrounding this collapse remember about a month ago he was worth about 20 billion dollars now he says he's worth a hundred thousand dollars he's under investigation by prosecutors and regulars but he insists he did not commit fraud let's take a look a lot of people look at you and see Bernie Madoff yeah I mean I don't think that's who I am at all but I understand why they're saying that people lost money and people lost a lot of money and I mean at the end of the day look there's a question of what happened and why and who did what ",
        "1": "um what caused the Meltdown and I think that is reads very differently right when you when you look at the classic Bernie Madoff story there was no real business there the whole thing as I understand it I think was was just one one big Ponzi scheme right fgx that was a real business he was at the top of the cryptocurrency world 30 year old billionaire Sam bankman freed you just need FTX it's FTX it's a safe and easy way to get into crypto yeah I don't think so Super Bowl ads naming stadiums Steph Curry Gizelle buncher we did a lot of things to try to uh to try and bolster our reputation to try and you know help our brand but in the early morning hours of November 11th it all came to an end when FTX filed for bankruptcy and bankman freed stepped down as CEO amid reports of FTX customer funds being used to pay Alameda research ",
        "2": "creditors this confirmed by former Alameda CEO Carolyn Ellison during early November video meeting with employees Alameda the crypto trading firm also founded by bankrin freed ABC News reached out to Carolyn Ellison for comment but as not heard back one of the reasons FDX went bankrupt is because FTX deposits yep were used to pay alameda's creditors Carolyn Ellison said you knew about that is that true you know the best I can tell uh Alameda did have a big position open on FTX um that position uh I think was you know very over collateralized a year ago there is a total Market collapse and you know specifically large correlated collapse in its assets you know over the last month and to some extent over the last year that I you know threatened that position quite a bit and I think that's you know as best I understand a lot of what happened there I I am no cryptocurrency expert of no Finance ",
        "3": "expert but I don't think you answered my question I always ask did you know that FDX deposits were used to pay off Alameda creditors uh I don't know of FTX deposits being used to pay off Alameda creditors are you uh which creditors are you referring to Carolyn Ellison said that you all knew that these funds were used were put into Alameda they were the funds owned by your depositors so I can't speak for who knew what you know a lot of the customers on FTX did have you know borrowers either you know in dollars or Bitcoin or Euros but as you know the FTX terms of service tell the people who signed up none of the digital Assets in your account are the property of or shall be or may be loaned to FTX Trading but you're saying that happen my understanding is a few things ",
        "4": "happen the first is there is a margin trading facility on FTX by which users can lend out funds by which other users borrow funds and so there are explicit cases where there is you know marching extended where there is borrow lending if the Alameda is borrowing the money that belongs to FDX depositors that's a bright red line isn't it there are a lot of cases where that's actually explicitly part of the programs and that are happening here here it says that the digital assets may not be loaned to FTX Trading they can't be loaned out I there existed a borrow lending facility on FTX and and I think that's probably covered I don't remember exactly where but somewhere else in the terms of service but they'd have to approve of that they're saying they didn't approve of it here they're saying you approved a bit if you've rewinded to you know the beginning of FTX ",
        "5": "um where you know some customers were you know uh I think in line with sort of existing relationships that that they've had at least in some cases wiring money straight to Alameda research in order to trade on FTX so you do know and you did know that FDX deposits were being funneled to Alameda so I was vaguely aware that that was how some virus were being sent in the first place um didn't that set off alarm bells in your head so there are a lot of people who are involved in that process and look I really deeply wish that I had taken like a lot more responsibility for understanding what the details were of what was going on there I knew that legal was involved I knew that other groups at the company were involved that you know there were agreements drafted up but you're ultimately responsible and ultimately absolutely like I look I should have been on top of this and I feel really ",
        "6": "really bad and regretful that I wasn't and a lot of people got hurt and that that's on me here's what Mark Cuban has to say about that yep he said if I were him I'd be afraid of going to jail for a long time at the end of the day you know it's not my call what happens and uh the world will judge me as it will are you worried about going to jail there are a lot of things that are worrying me right now um and you know as best as possible I'm trying to focus on what I can do going forward to be helpful and you know let whatever you know Regulatory and legal processes are happening play out as they will I do want to move on but just just finally on this this is really a yes or no question yep Carolyn Ellison says you knew that FTX funds were being final to Alameda did you know that I knew that there is ",
        "7": "an open margin position there and that involved no but that's all that I'm asking if she's in court and you're in court and she's under oath and you're under arrest and you're asked did you know that these funds were being funneled to Alameda what is your answer I did not know that there is any improper uh use of customer funds you also took out a one million dollar loan what was that for that was generally for reinvesting in the company I was not for you know consumption I you know to my knowledge I have basically nothing left um you know basically everything I had was invested in the business I expect I'm gonna have nothing at the end of this I ain't got a hundred thousand dollars left in my bank account last I checked and I I think I have you know uh One credit card working with that right now earlier this summer you thought you had what 32 billion probably 20 but uh a ",
        "8": "whole lot more than I do now I can't imagine what it feels like to go from 20 billion dollars to a hundred thousand dollars yeah it's I mean it's been a really it's been a really humbling fall in in a lot of ways how do you explain the failure was it an inattention arrogance um it's a good question is it unethical some part of it was just literal distraction I sh really should have spent some time each day taking a step back and saying what are the most important things here right and like how do I have oversight of those and make sure that I'm not losing track of those and frankly I did a pretty incomplete job at that I spent a lot less time looking at assets and looking at balances and positions because that's not where Revenue came from and so it I wasn't seen as a Core Business driver obviously it was a core risk and that was a huge mistake of mine to not think more about that you said ",
        "9": "one of your great talents in a podcast was managing risk that's right and it's obviously wrong well I it's I think that there is something maybe even deeper wrong there which was I wasn't even trying like I wasn't spending any time or effort trying to manage risk on FTX trying like and that that obviously that's a stunning station what that's a pretty stunning admission yeah I mean it I don't know what to say like what happened happened and like if I had been if I had been spending an hour a day thinking about risk management on FTX I don't think that would have happened I think I I stopped working as hard for a bit you know honestly if I look back on myself think I got a little cocky I made more than a little bit um and I think part of me like you know felt like um like we'd made it as I said that was a pretty stunning ",
        "10": "admission the whole job of the head of a firm like that is managing right at risk exactly and he wanted to he reached out he desperately he went against the advice of his lawyers uh he thanked me at the end we said we talked for close to two hours and you saw he didn't Flinch no from the tough questions but even though he had a hard time at times answering them and you know he just wants to speak his mind now one of the reasons he said he wants to speak his mind is is he still hopes that in some way he can contribute to the idea of getting some of the depositors monies back now I asked him is that delusional because that's a lot of money it's a lot of money and he has no role in FTX right now but he is under facing several investigations at this point but he wants to tell his side of the story I wonder how the people who lost money will respond to this interview because clearly he struggled to answer a lot of these key questions we will see yeah all right George thanks so much well hey there GMA fans Robin Roberts here thanks for checking out our YouTube channel ",
