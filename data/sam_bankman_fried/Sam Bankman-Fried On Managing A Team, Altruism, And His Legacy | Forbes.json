        "0": "[Music] i'm sam bankman freed i'm the ceo and co-founder of ftx i i you know brief backstory i went to mit um i had a good time there though i guess i learned that i didn't want to go into academia worked uh on wall street for about three and a half years after that at jane street capital really really enjoyed it there um got into crypto in 2017 and started up ftx a year later ftx it's a global crypto exchange um it's you know one of the top four or so exchanges globally have been building that out for the last few years i first started looking into crypto uh not because of anything to do with blockchain technology um it just seemed like a good trading opportunity that that was sort of what my background was and there are lots of signs that it was a space that had a ton of demand and a ton of excitement and interest and volume but not very much liquidity and what that means is there's a pretty ",
        "1": "significant chance that customers are not getting great prices when they're trading um and that for that same reason there's a potential law of mind to be made providing liquidity to those um you know being uh being a market maker doing arbitrage and trying to to sort of increase the efficiency and liquidity of crypto markets globally that did turn out to be true um it did turn out to be the case that this space was desperately in need of more liquidity especially you know in the early days um but it also quickly became clear that the space was in need of better infrastructure when you think about the infrastructure in crypto a lot of it is the exchanges they combine a lot of different business models together um and really the exchanges are both sort of the backend technology they're the risk engine they're the customer facing piece they're the compliancy aml kyc all put together and they weren't really living up to the task of servicing the space especially ",
        "2": "as it grew and it seemed like a really compelling opportunity to try to jump in and build something better i still didn't think it was going to succeed when when we started building ftx i thought there was a 20 chance that we would ever succeed in getting customers i had no idea how to market or build a brand and i was the most optimistic on the team other people were lower but it just seemed like such a compelling opportunity such a big opportunity that it was worth trying even though we didn't think the odds were very high of success i think there are a few things that i learned in a few things that that really surprised me um obviously there are a huge number of small things that i've learned over the course of my time in crypto but when you sort of zoom out uh to the bigger picture one thing that i definitely learned was how to manage a team and how to manage a company i thought i knew this going into the space i thought when i started in crypto that i knew how ",
        "3": "to manage people and i knew how to how to grow a company and the the you know the truth is that i knew how to manage a team when everyone was happy and i knew how to grow a company when it was easy and i was fairly good at that i had experience but i had no idea how to manage a team when there was stress when people were unhappy with each other when there was conflict i you know was presented with times when you know members of our team disagreed with each other disagreed with me especially and i didn't know what to do when people couldn't reconcile when people couldn't get on the same page and when that was really impacting our ability to get anything done as a company it took me a while i think to realize what you can do and what you have to do i think when you're trying to run a company to be able to get past moments when there's stress when there's frustration when there's disagreement because those moments will come ",
        "4": "and i think what sort of became clear to me eventually was that my my job is to make sure one way or another that we do the right things and that we get through them and you know my job isn't to tell someone that they should do the right thing my job isn't to hope people do the right thing my job isn't to construct a good plan and you know distribute it my job is to make sure that we do the right things at the end of the day one way or another and if i come up with a plan for it or we come up with a plan for her someone says they're gonna do it and that doesn't work i like it it doesn't mean anything for me to blame that on some someone else or something else or luck or a you know competitor or a teammate or anything like that i mean completely putting aside notions of blame or or anything like that like my job is to make sure the right thing happens one way or another at the end it took me a little while and i think a lot of conversations with people to really come to terms with that i ",
        "5": "think that's the single biggest thing i've learned about management you know in the in the uh in the time that i've been uh in crypto outside of that i i think that i've been really continuously surprised by how many opportunities there are um in crypto and frankly how many opportunities there are more generally i think there's just a lot of places where the world isn't isn't optimized it's not a sort of perfectly efficient hypothetical machine um you know people aren't all perfect shareholder maximize you know value maximizers there's an um and instead the world is messy that's how it is and it's sad that it's messy and it can be really frustrating i think and slow things down slow people down and cause a lot of damage but it's also an opportunity to try and make it better and i think that over time we've been seeing those opportunities in more and more places and i think as we build out more infrastructure um we don't see sort of the remaining ground ",
        "6": "to cover getting smaller we see it getting bigger because even faster than we're building we're discovering new things that we could build and should build in the end my goal is to do as much good as i can for the world i i'm perfect effective altruism community basically it's a group of people looking to try and figure out if you want to maximize the amount of good you do maximize the positive impact that you can have on the world what does that imply what does that mean you should do with your life and i think it sort of grew out of like here's a group of charities you're gonna donate a hundred dollars which will save the most lives right which saves the most lives per dollar donated um and you know it's centered on a bunch of really great developing world health charities uh things like you know uh the anti-malaria foundation systemiosis control um and some direct transfer charities to uh really poor areas of of the world and like like you know give directly is one there and giveaway will serve the pioneer of evaluating these charities ",
        "7": "comparing them and trying to figure out you know how you can save as many people um with with your money as you can you know since then the effective altruism movement has has broadened out to um include a lot of different ways of trying to to help the world because obviously not everything is direct and there are a lot of things that have uh broader but uh you know thinner impacts or harder to evaluate impacts and that doesn't mean they don't matter it doesn't mean they do matter either it's it's you know it just you need to analyze it one way or another you're never going to be perfect you're never going to know for sure but um but you can try you know you can try to figure out what the best causes are and i think it's identified a lot of particularly promising areas in addition to kind of developing world health um you know animal welfare especially on factory farms um and looking at things that could have really big impacts on the long run future of ",
        "8": "the world because anything that you do that affects the whole future it might be affecting tens of trillions of future people and um what might that look like you know i think amongst common causes global warming is probably one that comes up as something that could really alter the course um of the future it might not be the easiest place to impact though just because a lot of people have already started to work on that um and and so one place i think you know effective violations have been looking is where are more more you know neglected causes where are areas that might have huge impact and on which really not enough is is being done not even close to enough um you know one area which i think is really been sort of highlighted recently is pandemic preparedness um if the last two years has taught us anything i think is that we have no idea as a world what to do when a pandemic hits some lots of people think they individually do ",
        "9": "maybe some of them are right but clearly the world doesn't know clearly governments aren't prepared for this non-profits hospitals are no part of our response to kovac 19 was sort of well trained and as much damage as it's done and as horrible as it's been it's not the worst thing you could imagine for for all of it it harms you know the current price is not the most lethal virus and uh that's not to undersell how much damage is done to people but um but you could imagine something worse you could imagine something that was just as spreadable but but you know frankly more deadly and i think that especially as biotechnology advances this worry probably becomes bigger and i think it's pretty clear at this point that we need to start preparing now for the next time because you know what we're left with now was a really unpleasant choice that a lot of people felt like they had to make between their safety their health and their freedom ",
        "10": "and you never want to have to trade those off that's not a good situation to be in ever what what does that mean it means that you know we can be prepared to detect future pandemics early it means that we can build potential uh cures for them as quickly as possible as soon as possible to cut them off at the source um and it means you know doing future research on ways to combat these um things that hopefully can help prevent the worst hard choices in the future that's one area that i think could be extremely impactful and then there are other potential things that could really impact the future when you look at the impact of you know artificial intelligence which right now frankly is obviously incredibly you know impressive and promising but hasn't yet really revolutionized the world what we have right now are chat bots that are kind of okay um but that's a lot better than they were five years ago and ",
        "11": "you know if you keep going down this path they're gonna get better ai's gonna get more powerful and it has you know has the power to change the world for better or for worse and it's gonna happen we're not gonna not build ai um we're not gonna suddenly decide that you know technology is evil but it's incumbent on us to to make it you know as good as possible and and to mitigate the risks from it and uh i think that's an area which is really hard to make concrete progress on right now but it's going to become so important as as you know ai's progress that we're taking it seriously and that we are having the hard conversations about what role it should be playing what governance should be like um and uh you know what safety controls on on ai should be like as as it scales up those are i think some areas that are probably going to have pretty big impact um you know going forward and you know ",
        "12": "frankly i think that policy and politics do as well um so anyway you know i think as an a what what do i think about i mean i think it's you know mostly what what i think about is what role should i be playing here and i think the most impressive people i know the people who i've uh the most respect for and um uh and and who who are maybe doing the most good for the world are are the people who are really taking charge of some of these initiatives um to to combat some of the biggest problems that that we're facing as a society but you know another way that that one kind of impact is is by helping to to fund some of these causes and you know that that's what i've been doing so i've uh you know i got into finance in the first place to try and maximize the amount that i can donate to uh to some of the most effective causes and um you know i'd certainly love to be ",
        "13": "spending more time thinking directly about what these projects can be working on but you know right now there are a lot of really impressive people doing that i wish there were way more my main role right now is to do what i can to help support them financially or or any other way that i can [Music] my schedule is all over the place and that's intentional if you have an incredibly regimented schedule especially when you're running a company there's no chance it's going to lead you in the right place because the world changes your company changes different things are important at different times and if you have your you know daily call about you know exchange liquidity and there's nothing going on with exchange liquidity you're just going to waste that hour right and meanwhile there's some fire burning somewhere that you have to be attending to so it really does change day to day and it changes month to month we'll go through seasons where various things are really important or are less ",
        "14": "important but what are sort of some of the jumble of things that you know that really play a significant role in my schedule these days um number one is regulation and licensing that is the most important thing for our business um it's the most important thing for the industry right now and uh there's sort of a path that the industry could go down that i really hope it doesn't where you see bickering between regulators and companies both are are frustrated there's acrimony and it's just sort of like a continuous onslaught of non-compliance enforcement actions and constructive regulations which leave everyone upset most of all the customer who wanted you know safe powerful products and instead got complete chaos and uh and gridlock so you know one of the i think the biggest ",
        "15": "things that we're working on is first of all licensing we've recently received licenses in a number of countries which i'm really excited about and really grateful for the work that the regulators frankly put in in those countries to build out frameworks for a complex new industry and to engage with industry on those we are working with a number of others um on on licensing whether it's acquiring licenses whether it's building out licensing regimes or whether it's just being you know a source of of feedback when we can other than than than regulation you know i'll spend some time talking with developers um usually every day um it's just really important that i try to stay on top of what the important things that are going on are where our priorities are and how long those are taking what the feedback people have is i'll spend some time talking to customers each day you know ",
        "16": "i try to go through support tickets now and then i try to respond to customers who reach out and i think this is really important because if i don't know what's frustrating customers i won't know how to help guide people who are trying to help them you know people come to me with questions and problems and and as soon as i don't know what they're talking about i'm not going to be a helpful leader so i'll spend some of my day doing that i'll spend some of my day just answering questions from employees helping out um giving feedback on a really wide number of of you know things that we're doing people you know they'll draft up a document send it over i'll take a look give some feedback um i try really hard not to be a blocker on those i try hard to just green light them when i'm comfortable um and to give the feedback that i have and let people run with it because the worst thing that you can do is be the under-informed manager who's getting in the way ",
        "17": "um and you know i spend some time each day thinking about what the most important priorities for us are what the things we're screwing up what the things we should be thinking harder about doing better on are and talking to you know co-workers about how we can work on those i'll spend time you know talking with press i'll spend time you know on interviews i'll spend time on twitter i spend probably an hour to a day on twitter um it you know there are pros and cons but it's frankly the best way for me to get a sense of what's going on in the industry and and with our users um and um and then i'll just spend time talking about whatever else has come up and it's hard to predict day-to-day what that is but it's a fast-moving industry it's 24 7. things are always happening um and people are all across the world in every time zone and i'll take calls whenever it makes sense and you know shift my schedule to meet those so it's it's chaotic it's it's varied ",
        "18": "there's not a whole lot of consistency to it and that's by design because that's how the world is and it's important that you know i sort of keep in mind and that we as a company keep in mind what the most important high level goals are although those themselves change but it's just as important that we get the details right and the details are are constantly in flux i don't have a lot of time for hobbies i i play some league of legends quite badly i watch way too much sports in the background i i like i like multitasking and so i i will often have something up in the background and uh i play games i i play chess i play chess variants with co-workers um i daydream i play badminton um i think i think that's that's sort of most of them but uh but you know i try and squeeze them in when i can but but in the end you know work intervenes and that's the way it is ",
        "19": "i don't think i give a about my legacy that's not what matters like i think what matters is what impact i have on the world in the end and really more than what impact everyone as of the world doesn't matter if i make the world better or if someone else does that better is better and you know if i can do anything to help other people help the world that's just as good so it's obviously sort of part of me would love my my legacy to be to be you know generically positive but uh but i just don't think that's what matters in the end it's the mark that we actually leave on the world not the mark we're perceived to leave on the world that matters [Music] ",
