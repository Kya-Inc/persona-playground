        "1": "situation as they are the statutory regulator of companies like FTX digital markets who operate in the digital asset space to date the Securities Commission has issued two significant statements concerning the provisional liquidation proceedings involving FTX and other related matters I encourage you all to read those statements for yourselves as they are definitive accounts of the known facts and the application of the relevant laws and Regulatory regime in relation to FTX these statements should also be read in conjunction with the communication made to the House of Assembly by prime minister Davis on November 22nd also concerning FTX digital markets while cryptocurrency and digital assets are part of a new and complex industry on a basic level recent events involving the insolvency crisis experienced by the FTX group of companies have experienced been experienced around the world in ",
        "2": "practically every sector to that extent what happened can more readily be understood as a case of a very large business failure as a result of questionable internal management practices and corporate governance given how quickly things have moved it's hard to believe that it was only 25 days ago on November 2nd that an article first appeared on the news site coindesk with the details of a leaked financial statement of Alameda research a Trading Company also founded by Sam bankman freed I want to pause here to emphasize that among the over 100 companies located in dozens of jurisdictions around the world FTX digital markets is the only entity regulated in the Bahamas Alameda research is not regulated in the Bahamas to the extent Alameda research is found to have committed any improprieties in ",
        "3": "the Bahamas then of course they will be subject to our jurisdiction the balance sheet of Alameda research coindesk reported at the time revealed that a large portion of their assets were held in ftt this is a token issued by an FTX entity that granted token holders a discount on trading fees on their Exchange four days later on November 6 binance a crypto exchange that is a major rival to FTX announced that it was selling off all its substantial Holdings in the same ftt token this announcement prompted a large number of FTX investors to withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in digital assets from FTX causing a liquidity crunch in short FTX was experienced the equivalent of a run on the bank when customers you all rush in to withdraw all of their assets simultaneously ",
        "4": "two days later on November 8th it was reported that binance had entered a non-binding agreement to buy FTX however the very next day on November 9th binance pulled out of the deal and it was only one day following this on November 10th in 2022 the Securities Commission of the Bahamas announced that it had taken action to freeze the assets of FTX digital markets had suspended the registration of FTX digital markets as a licensee under the digital assets and registered exchange act also known as the Dare act and applied to the Supreme Court of the Bahamas pursuant to its regulatory Authority Under the Dare act to place the company in provisional liquidation the speed of which the Securities Commission was able to move was remarkable by any standard over the course of eight days Market confidence was lost in a company which ",
        "5": "at one point had a 32 billion dollar valuation the Securities Commission deserves the highest praise for moving so swiftly and decisively to suspend FTX digital markets license and appoint the provisional Liquidators in addition the Securities Commission recognized that given the nature of digital assets and the risks associated with hacking and compromise placing FTX digital markets in provisional liquidation was not sufficient to protect the customers and creditors of the company therefore pursuant to us their Authority Under the Dare Act and pursuant to an order of the Supreme Court of the Bahamas the Securities Commission secured the assets of FTX digital markets to be held on behalf of and for the benefit and restitution of clients and creditors of FTX the commission was the first regulator ",
        "6": "in the world to take significant steps with respect to the FTX group of companies which has operations and regulated activities throughout the world this was done for the purpose of protecting the interest of FTX customers and creditors as well as the Integrity of the Bahamian Financial Services industry the Securities Commission was able to move so quickly because of the strength of the legislative framework which was already in place in the Bahamas to regulate digital asset companies like FTX digital markets no other jurisdiction in the world moved or could have moved this quickly in circumstances such as these it is important for me to share this summary of what took place because over the last few weeks the basic facts have been obscured by guessing games and rumors we understand the enormous interest in ",
        "7": "this story but as a government we decided right away that what was most important was not to engage with speculation or gossip but instead to proceed methodically and deliberately in accordance with the exercise of due process and the rule of law as we have stated we are in the early stages of an active ongoing investigation it is very complex investigation the structure and reach of FTX activities are truly Global as they consist of over 100 companies located in dozens of jurisdictions as with any active inquiry we seek to share updates in a way that does not compromise or constrain investigators and tonight I can underscore that we believe that faith in the Bahamas as a responsible jurisdiction will only be strengthened as events continue to unfold ",
        "8": "the digital assets industry is still in its infancy the emergence of any new industry will inevitably feature ups and downs as innovators attempt to harness new technology to new applications since the official launch of Bitcoin in January of 2009 the possibilities that digital assets smart contracts distributed Ledger technology technology and fintech represented peaked interest across the financial and Technology worlds despite the rapid growth in the industry by 2018 many jurisdictions had not introduced any legal or regulatory framework that specifically addressed digital assets there are still no agreed upon standards globally Regulators around the world are still grappling with the issue of how to regulate digital assets there are a number of reasons for this including the complexity of regulating ",
        "9": "the digital asset space but most Regulators actually lack the broad statutory mandate or the legal scope to provide any regulation or even legal Clarity on cryptocurrencies digital assets and their related businesses digital assets are in use in jurisdictions across the world in North America Central and South America in Europe Middle East Asia Africa and in the South Pacific they are being utilized and traded in countries whether there is a regulatory framework in place or not the Bahamas decided that we needed to actively engage in this sector for two primary reasons first to take advantage of the Strategic opportunity of this new sector and second to protect our existing Financial Services sector from the risks which unregulated activities connected with cryptocurrency and other digital assets ",
        "10": "may bring about such as illicit Finance the Bahamas with significant expertise in International Financial Services regulation decided we would not allow this activity in our jurisdiction without the establishment of a robust legal and Regulatory framework reflective of the best practices observed in the industry and in compliance with recommendations of global standard setters in 2020 the Bahamas enacted the digital asset and registered exchanges Act it remains a pioneering piece of legislation recognized internationally as being Innovative and forward-thinking one example of this earlier this year assistant United States Secretary of State for the Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols noted and I quote the Bahamas has a has long been an important Financial Center globally and it is ",
        "11": "pioneering responsible cryptocurrency regulation it is the provisions of the Dare act which gave the authority the to the Securities Commission to act as quickly and decisively as it did in the case of FTX digital markets so how did we get to this moment with FTX digital markets in July of 2021 FTX digital markets was incorporated in the Bahamas and applied to be registered as a digital asset business under the Dare Act in September of 2021 just over one year ago the Securities Commission after many months of prior engagement approved FTX digital markets licensed to operate FDX operated globally for over two years prior to coming to the Bahamas having been headquartered previously in Hong Kong FTX digital markets quickly set about establishing a major presence in the ",
        "12": "Bahamas buying properties higher in training Bahamian staff and sponsoring a number of charitable and Community Ventures in many ways this Behavior was no different from that which we see from many of our corporate citizens meanwhile in The Wider economy inflation battered countries across the globe leading to higher interest rates the invasion of Ukraine added to the volatility of energy prices and a broad range of technology companies slumped in the stock market and laid off tens of thousands of workers the international digital assets industry experienced a major downturn as well as the Prime Minister Davis pointed out in his statement to Parliament and I quote there have been both booms and busts in the world of crypto and this year has been a significant bust with total market capitalization falling from ",
        "13": "three trillion dollars to 800 billion dollars or lower the Steep sell-offs and declining volumes have led analysts to describe this time as a crypto winter in the spring of this year Tara Luna a stable coin system collapsed leading eventually to a wave of bankruptcies by crypto lending platforms like Celsius three hours capital and Voyager for a time it appeared that FTX would bail out and acquire the assets of some of these distressed companies but instead FTX itself could not avoid the cascading failures and faced its own severe insolvency crisis so I asked where are we now as I said at the outset there's an active and ongoing investigation of the Affairs of FTX digital markets involving both civil and criminal authorities as is provided for under our regulatory ",
        "14": "framework we are ready working with a number of Specialists and experts and will continue to do so as the need arises there are a number of protective measures with the regulator has taken under Authority Under The Authority conferred by the Supreme Court of the Bahamas for the time being we will not set out those measures in any further detail until we are confident that doing so will not jeopardize any aspect of the ongoing investigations we urge all authorities here and abroad at a minimum to exercise at least the same amount of prudence and restraint in their public commentary as we do so as not to Prejudice any of the proceedings that are ongoing it is extremely regrettable that in chapter 11 filings for bankruptcy protection made in New York last week that the new chief executive of FTX trading limited not the bahamas-based ",
        "15": "FTX digital markets but an affiliate company incorporated in Antigua and Barbuda misrepresented the timely action taken by the Securities Commission and used inaccurate allegations lodged in the transfer motion they had filed to do so it is possible that the prospect of multi-million dollar legal and consultancy fees is driving both their legal strategy and their intemperate statements in any case we urge prudence and accuracy in all future filings in all matters as for what comes next the Securities Commission our financial intelligence unit and the financial crimes unit of the Royal Bahamas police force will continue to investigate the facts and circumstances regarding ftx's insolvency crisis and any potential violations of Bahamian law they will hold accountable any responsible companies and individuals ",
        "16": "and act in cooperation with other Regulatory Agencies and law enforcement bodies both here in the Bahamas and in other countries that are affected these events remind us of the lessons learned from Securities and other Financial regulation about the need for strong cross-border cooperation the public worldwide will be best served by a strong International regulatory cooperation that means more jurisdictions taking up the challenge following our lead and implementing strong regulatory Frameworks we will as we always do cooperate with International Regulatory and enforcement agencies ladies and gentlemen while new facts emerge every day there's still so much to discover and while they may well be a number of personal tragedies associated with this fall of this company there appears to be ",
        "17": "little contagion beyond the digital asset sphere both here in the Bahamas and around the world in fact bahamians and other stakeholders in the Bahamas should take great Confidence from the standard and Poor's ratings forecast for the Bahamas that was issued Tuesday November 22nd standards and poor has projected a stable outlook for our economy resting in part on the assumption that there will be no material adverse impact on the Bahamas from the worldwide collapse of FTX but as our investigations continue I must emphasize that ill-informed speculation is not helpful neither to the customers of FTX nor the creditors nor their investors or in fact the General Public any attempt to lay the entirety of this debacle at the feet of the Bahamas because FTX is headquartered here would be a gross oversimplification of reality ",
        "18": "the dozens and dozens of companies involved registered in numerous jurisdictions across the world the scope of related parties including some of the world's most sophisticated investors demonstrate the cross-border multi-jurious jurisdictional nature of this event and is deeply misguided to conclude that reluctance to communicate the details of an active investigation means that nothing is happening in fact the government's discretion stems from how seriously we take our commitment to the rule of law and the independence of the Securities regulator in the Bahamas we have been shocked at the ignorance of those who assert that FTX came to the Bahamas because they did not want to submit to regulatory scrutiny in fact the world is full of countries in which there is no legislative or regulatory authority over the crypto and digital asset business but I must say the Bahamas is not one of ",
        "19": "these countries we have been able to assert our leadership in this new field because in the in the digital assets Arena what matters is not the size of your land mass nor the size of your GDP but the Ingenuity and rigor of your people and your jurisdiction when a respected risk and Market Integrity firm rank the world's digital assets regulatory regimes earlier this year our country the Bahamas was first and for a good reason the digital asset sector is a high-profile embryonic sector of the Bahamian Financial Services sector an area where the Bahamas has just demonstrated Global Leadership for decades as a world-leading destination for terrorism we have been audacious before and asserting that it's better in the Bahamas we will not hesitate to do so again ",
        "20": "my fellow bahamians we know that the world is watching insofar as these are matters of pressing Global interest and concern we welcome the attention we have every confidence that the world will see how our policies our laws and Regulatory regime have so much to commend to others we have much to be proud of we do not apologize for our ambition for bahamians to be at the Forefront of this exciting Innovative sector the Bahamas stands behind its decision to regulate digital assets and related businesses we stand behind the quality of the regulations that exist we continue to invite digital asset businesses to operate from within this jurisdiction all told we remain one of the few countries in the world with such a complete and effective regulatory framework the actions of the Securities Commission ",
        "21": "of the Bahamas which they took on the 10th and 12th of November were to protect the clients and creditors of FTX digital markets this demonstrates why the Dare Act is among the world's leading legislative Frameworks for the regulation of digital assets and related businesses like the.com boom and bust of the past we believe that the turbulence currently being experienced by the digital asset sector will pass and that there is still much potential for growth and opportunity ahead in fact I am fully confident that as matters progress and the AFT the the activities of the FTX group are either restructured or wound down the Bahamas will emerge held in even higher esteem a turbulent cryptocurrency period on a global basis and the downfall of a single Bahamian company in no way threatens a bright future for the ",
        "22": "Bahamas in fact it's quite the opposite those entrepreneurs who are ready to create new Financial products that serve a broader range of consumers remain welcome to come to the Bahamas they can be certain that we have in place a principled fair comprehensive and ethical regulatory regime they can also be certain we will act quickly and decisively to enforce that regulatory regime if and when are laws and regulations are breached they will see that the Bahamas is a place of laws they will see that the rule of law and the exercise of due process characterize the Integrity of our jurisdiction and they will have found yet another reason why it's better in the Bahamas thank you very much this has been a national statement from the attorney general and minister of ",
