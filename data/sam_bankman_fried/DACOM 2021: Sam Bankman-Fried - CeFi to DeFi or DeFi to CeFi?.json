        "0": "[Music] thank you so much everyone for joining us today for the first day of our 4day.com d5 series jointly brought to you by crypto compare solidus labs so currency and the global digital currency association we've titled this event rising tide challenges and opportunities for regulated decentralized finance and each day over the next four days will bring together some of the industry's foremost thinkers in the d5 movement whether they be from leading projects and digital asset trading venues traditional financial services firms evolving to embrace this new evolution or regulators seeking to bring clarity and transparency amidst maturing and evolving financial landscape my name is alyssa ostrove i'm the chief of staff at crypto compare a leading provider of digital asset market data and indices this event has been many months in the making um and would not be possible without ",
        "1": "the tireless work of my fellow co-organizers ken arrad who is the chief operating officer of solidus labs a category definer for crypto market surveillance offering the first crypto native risk monitoring hub jackson mueller who's the director of policy and government relations at socurency a leading developer of institutional grade blockchain based financial and regulatory infrastructure technology and david carman who's the co-founder and board member of the global digital currency association a self-regulatory association for the crypto industry the format of this event is a 30-minute keynote fireside chat followed by a one-hour panel discussion each day covering a unique facet of the decentralized finance and digital asset ecosystem in today's session discussing what's next for defy we'll first hear from sam bankman freed followed by a panel discussion moderated by kami russo of the defiant ",
        "2": "and featuring an amazing lineup of speakers from ave alchemy consensus and balancer labs if you haven't yet signed up for the rest of this week's events you can join us at the same time every day with our final session concluding this thursday tomorrow we'll focus on d5 regulation and institutionalization featuring cftc commissioner dan berkovitz is our keynote speaker proceeded by a great panel of speakers from state street wisdom tree and so currency moderated by noel atchison of genesis trading so without any further ado i'd like to introduce today's keynote session featuring sam bankman freed the founder and ceo of both ftx and alameda research moderated by a sophomore ear ceo and co-founder of solidus labs assaf i'd like to invite you to take things from here thanks alisa excited to kick off this week events here with sam sam thank you for joining us really happy you're here i know it's quite late ",
        "3": "uh over in your side of the globe so appreciate it yeah thanks for having me absolutely um so how about we start with something light weighted uh considering the time um so you know as elisa mentioned dot com event is a very much about defy and crypto with a focus on the role of regulation and institution institutions in it um as a key main driver now taking a different angle you one of the key drivers i wanted to ask you about was your recent sponsorship of the miami hitz now the ftx arena and the most even recent partnership with tom brady uh now granted i am originally from israel i don't know much about american sports but even i know that tom brady is a big deal so i want to ask you about that you know is it all just fun or is it in your view a main driver for kind of mainstream adoption for crypto and d5 yeah i think you kind of hit the nail on the head there when you said that you know you're not ",
        "4": "from the states but even you know he's a big deal i mean i think that's exactly what we were shooting for and you know i think it is a big a big piece of adoption for us and you know what we're shooting for there is what are the things we can do that can get tens of millions of people um to to become aware and engaged um especially in a way that doesn't dilute our brand too much that doesn't seem just sort of rude and you know obviously you could buy tens of millions of facebook ads i don't know maybe it's correct uh you know maybe not um but we wanted to try and find something that would hopefully be a bit more engaging than that got it no i mean yeah that makes a lot of sense uh exactly if i heard about him then the reach was quite vast uh you know we we i want to even take this further into the decentralized aspect of things um you know we like speaking a lot about ",
        "5": "decentralization uh it's a lot of our work here at solidus but in practice most of trading today is centralized including at fdx and the key topic for this week is really whether d5 will go c5 or c4 is going to go defy and as someone who is you know serving millions of users on fdx but also recently launched serum on solana you're in a really unique position to try and answer that i'd love to hear your thoughts there totally and i think that the big thing that you know when i think about this is um you know basically like what are the core advantages and disadvantages of different systems um you know who knows exactly what will happen but at least you can map out what could happen or it might make sense to happen there are a lot of big advantages to d5 um when you look at the composability of different programs that's absolutely huge um ",
        "6": "and it means that you can get sort of exponential growth of the ecosystem in a really native way um you know there there are a lot of cool things going on there um there are also some downsides to it that i think people don't talk about that much what are the downsides well right now you can talk about the regulatory aspect that that's potentially it's uncertain and addressable so i'm going to put that aside although that is something that both regulators and industry are going to have to kind of cooperatively figure out what the plan is for but so maybe i can interject here when you're when you're speaking about regulation i want to yeah you know obviously it's something it's a big topic internally it's all yes and i wanna i wanna separate things here there's regulation that is usually uh mandated by governments right and then there is regulation in-house regulation that we are seeing a lot of the market participants pushing for in order to protect their users from bad behavior and you know and when it comes to defense initial conversation right whether market operators should be ",
        "7": "responsible and have their users backs in case something bad takes place it's super interesting it turns a lot of scripts on on on their head and it's not obvious if it's good or bad necessarily but it's different right and it's like you replace one sort of risk for another you completely replace the sort of like bad actor risk of the designer the protocol or at least mostly replace that but instead you have like bug risk which is way harder to address right and you have you know if someone makes mistakes somewhere it's often way harder or impossible to fix in d5 and so so i think that those are all super interesting questions i don't think that's necessarily going to you know determine the long run fate of d5 though i do things have very large impact on the short run but these are sort of addressable i think there's a few very hard to address things um and they get down to really the core computational efficiency of different protocols where if you have ",
        "8": "a geographically decentralized consensus mechanism it takes 100 milliseconds for light to travel around the world that's a very hard thing to to to sort of like i mean going faster than the speed of light is not easy shall we say um and you know and so what this means is that it's very very difficult to imagine a truly decentralized protocol with a latency of less than 100 milliseconds um it's also hard to imagine a truly decentralized protocol that isn't spending at least a hundred to a thousand times the minimum necessary amount of compute because again you want to have a ton of different validators or nodes or miners or whatever you're calling these people each independently calculating out the entire blockchain right not just one central server so what this means is it's not a good fit for things that are very very strongly uh kind of like bound by compute where just that that's a big factor in determining how well they work and so what does this mean it means ",
        "9": "posting a link to a video on a d5 protocol totally fine absolutely trivial posting a video itself on a d5 protocol very difficult because it's just so massive and file right and and and and then when you look at the trading realm robin hood type applications absolutely fine on d5 there's an extra half second flag when you swipe right on those so adding 100 milliseconds not a big deal when you look at two hft firms trading with each other 100 milliseconds is an eternity and so i think what that means is just that like you know i think the real big upside of defy is that like a decent chunk of the world's businesses will run on it not all of them maybe not most of them but a pretty sizable number i mean that would be absolutely massive we're talking tens to hundreds of trillions of dollars a value from that but i do think that like when you then get to the question of d5 or c5 of like which type of exchange will win i think there's always going to be centralized exchanges ",
        "10": "at least in some respects because for some of the trading that goes on you actually need to have a single centralized server but not for all of it and so i think that's sort of like the upside of d5 is that it captures some significant chunk although not certainly not all of that space yeah so you know it's interesting what you're saying there are you know concrete trading technical capabilities that need to be developed in order to usher in this type of kind of mainstream decentralized adoption and then i know you know uh solana is is developing a lot around its uh parallelization for scalability being able to um process multiple orders at the same time not sequentially and so assuming that's all solved right all those technical patches are being put there in 10 years so i i hear you often speak about this vision of being able to have 100x volumes on on decentralized ",
        "11": "finance but what does it mean for you know the retail accredited and institutional investors day-to-day i mean quite literally what what is that vision or i would ask what is your ideal outcome of that you know when you were deciding about solana what were you thinking what was your vision there so first of all i think the most ambitious vision has to have at least five percent of the world's economy running on chain like i think that is theoretically doable probably bigger than five percentages and so if you're sort of like you've got to be shooting for numbers that are at least that big um in sort of the real upside cases not saying you necessarily will reach them um and then what's that look like for the actual users um hopefully it looks like you know a billion people globally or more are using d5 and that there's an absolute explosion of applications on it and that there's a huge huge variety of them and that it's you know when you think about an entrepreneur ",
        "12": "that the easiest way to launch a business is to put a decent chunk of it on chain because you get to build off of what everyone else has right if you want to build your retail trading app by far the easiest place to start is to design a new trading interface on an existing dex because that is easy that you don't need like it's all a completely well-defined protocol that you can build on top of and so i think you see a lot of of innovation happening a lot of composability being taken advantage of with that and just a lot of new applications coming out and i think you know people talk a lot about about retail trading i think social media is another obvious example here where um all right now we're fractured between you know 50 major social media sites worldwide and if you tweet something no one can see it on facebook or weibo or wechat or line um but these all have the same underlying protocol right which is just like a way to send a ",
        "13": "message to some an encrypted message that some specified set of people can read and what you can imagine is an underlying protocol that all of these draw from where i you know there's some basically encrypted social messaging protocol and then everything else is a different sort of taking gui on top of that and use your experience on top of it but it means that you don't lose your data when you go from another one to another or you can specify the extent to which that happens but if you want you can send a single message is accessible on exactly you know whichever set of platforms you want it to be accessible on and it means that it's easy to launch your own you know it's a permissionless bottom layer and then if you want to launch a moderated you know version it's easy to use so if you want to launch an unmoderated version you can do so there can be different types of moderated versions depending on what people want there um and they're all composable and so it's not like you have this giant networking bottleneck that stops a new ",
        "14": "version from having any value because it already gets to draw from the existing corpus material as i think that's like another sort of exciting vision for what could happen with an industry on chain yeah you know what what i'm what i'm i was uh impressed with uh in one of your recent interviews you mentioned how um you have something that eyes or naive or nastic doesn't have and that's uh a twitter a very active twitter user base that keeps tweeting at you kind of what they want you know they wanted lumber features you had it in within you know a few hours yep i wanted to ask you know when it comes to and we touched upon this slightly earlier but i want to go back to that in terms of what's the role of and i'll put aside regulation but what's the role of risk mitigation as it comes to decentralized finance and and whether you've seen this type of push coming in from users from you know folks that are trading um here and on you know decentralized ",
        "15": "finance protocols uh what is your view there you seen that coming up so it's a good question and one thing that i will say is that right now and this may change but today most of the users of d5 are very highly engaged crypto users it's not a mass audience you know kind of new user acquisition funnel right now these are people who know their way around crypto and that changes the conversation a lot right these are sophisticated users who know what they're doing who understands the trades that they understand they're power users right and there's an ex bsc is a little bit different here because bsc's natural crowd to some extent is d5 but to some extent it's finance users bians has a massive user base much bigger than all of d5 put together today and many of them are much newer users and so when you look at like applications on bsc we see a lot more people asking very ",
        "16": "basic questions um when you look at basically any other active chain right now you know people know what they're doing the questions that we get asked are remarkably sophisticated and and so when you talk about things like you know security safety um you know how easy it is to break your funds accidentally everything like that it's just a less big concern for these users because they really know their way around but this is a big but when we see people who have never really done much crypto before try try out defy they have a miserable experience it's really bad and a lot has to be done on that and how does that how does that really reply towards institutions you might be talking with yeah it's a good question the answer is they're very excited about the idea of d5 most of them have never tried it when they do try it they're like jesus this is not ready um it's like a very negative reaction when they actually try defy but very positive when they hear about ",
        "17": "it and so what you'll see is that when they're staying in the distance they're like this is really powerful but we have to understand the regulatory positioning of this in order to figure out how we can interface it when they try it they're like this is this is not this product isn't there yet now that doesn't mean the sector won't get there and it doesn't mean the institutions don't think well like they remember why they're so excited to try it and and so i i really don't want to try and imply that like institutions think the idea of d5 isn't going to work it's that the current user experience isn't there um and so instead what you see almost exclusively when institutions want to get into d5 they don't touch it themselves they do centralized trading with a centralized counterparty that themselves touches defy whether it's an otc counterparty whether it's just a borrow lending desk or something else the real flow of funds here is regulated institution lends capital at some interest rate some ",
        "18": "other party then goes and does the defy thing you know gets a little bit higher interest rate and and and that middle party or maybe even there's one other party at this change here is one that actually understands how to interface with c5 protocols right i mean yeah those those entities have fiduciary responsibilities that you know they have to adhere by and different suitability measures um so yeah that makes a lot of sense at least at this point their gateway is a intermediary that knows how to access this realm of defy that makes a lot of sense so you know this actually makes me um kind of it reminds me of everything that happened with gamestop um you know it's the mix of retail institutions uh funny enough during the the crazy friends that happened um we were approached by market operators asking us hey is there anything we've learned from ",
        "19": "risk mitigation in crypto that we can apply possibly towards the traditional markets right because what happened with gamestop is yeah similarly what we're seeing crypto all the time i mean crypto is a retail first industry uh that all of a sudden allowed you know more and more right now institutions to come in but on the other side of things in the traditional industry it was always institutionally first that allowed retail to come in order to allow for liquidation do you think sam that the that you know the traditional industry has something to learn from the crypto um realm of things absolutely absolutely and i think that like when you look at at what that means um you know when when when sort of like you know gamestop went crazy obviously there's high volatility high lot gains high losses whatever things happen when things get volatile but you also saw a lot of platforms turn off buying if gamestop ",
        "20": "and that is not something that should happen in crypto and it's not something that well okay a lot of crypto exchanges actually did go down that day let's put that aside for a second that's what would you like that's sorry that's right yeah right um put that aside you know ftx data but uh but um but you know i and what happened was that there was um at its real core um there are a lot of issues with settlement in the traditional financial ecosystem um things will only trade like 35 hours a week which means that there's these giant gaps between trading sessions where things could move price a lot without any ability to close down positions you have ach and credit card transfers which take two months to settle and that entire time is basically a margin trade if you're using those funds to buy something because you might charge back um and ",
        "21": "there's the fact that there's like 12 different companies involved in a typical trade the cup the exchange the clearing the custody the stocks the fiat the the the the mobile app the customer acquisition those are all different costs different companies and and no one can fully trust that the other is definitely exactly what they say they are and so because of this you have huge uncertainty over settlement in a lot of ways and that just means that whenever things get volatile everyone's worried someone else is going to fall down on the trade right that someone else is going to fail to deliver and and that evernote supposes regulatory capital which is capital on top of fully funding a position because no one really thinks the position is 100 definitely fully funded um and that just causes serious issues and you put on top of that that there could be a 50 gap move overnight with no ability to trade in between so you have to have massive risk tolerance there with crypto everything ",
        "22": "is generally fully funded um if it's margin it's explicit that's margin with an explicit liquidation system that everyone understands and 24 7 markets and so you can close down positions whenever you need to which means you only need to be planning for you know 10 minutes of volatility not 10 hours um and all of those things mean that you know there's a lot of tools that the crypto ecosystem has to stay up in liquid um in ways where the traditional financial ecosystem often has to shut down right oh yeah and by the way those those i think merits of crypto uh the 24 7 operational market um the accessibility of it also creates uh more challenges that you know market participants have to deal with i'm being signaled that we're nearing the end so uh sam i wanna i wanna ask you kind of one question uh for foreclosure that we'd like to ask in dakon ",
        "23": "what do you think we'll be talking about in dot com 2022 and what do you think we'll be talking about in dakum 2030 if this year's highlight is defined you know what do you think is going to happen next year what do you think is going to happen in 10 years give or take totally so i mean i think that we're going to be still talking a year from now about different scalability solutions um i think that it's not the world hasn't figured out what's gonna happen there yet and i think that there is you know whether you're talking about layer twos whether you're talking about side chains about different layer ones and i think eventually the world's gonna decide all these words are pretty similar to each other and that like these grand distinctions drawn between them were thinner than people thought and really everyone's looking at the same thing which is a faster blockchain and you can call it what you want right if that that's what all these things are right um but i think that that that's not going to be fully resolved in a year ",
        "24": "and he's going to be absolutely just the biggest open question you know ten years from now i hope and i have significant uncertainty but my hope is that people are talking about uh all the cool new companies that are launching on chain that's my hope but if the industry us up then instead maybe people are talking about how it was such disappointment that that it never got huge what what we have a minute but i have to now follow up on this what would you consider a big scrub of the industry how can we now uh you know derail this if it's uh you know what should market operators avoid what would you pay attention to one big thing we have to we absolutely have to build great products with great user experiences if we don't do that nothing else is going to work and right now i think d5 hasn't quite gotten there um that's something just absolutely has to happen um and we have to solve scalability that's ",
        "25": "the other big thing like you just cannot be paying 30 for a transaction and you cannot have a completely fractured ecosystem where no one single application can exist because there doesn't even exist a single truck big enough for it um i think that those are the two big things that have to happen and to the extent those don't i think the industry is going to be kind of stuck unable to grow or go mainstream uh that's great and i guess that's also what's top of mind for ftx these days which is it's great to hear um i know we are at time and i think our mc at least i think right there's a there's a panel coming after us so sam i'd love to you know take this quick minute to thank you for being here today uh it's been great having you i appreciate it i know it's very late there so thank you thank you [Music] "
