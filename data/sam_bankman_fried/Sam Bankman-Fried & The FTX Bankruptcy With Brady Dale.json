        "0": "thanks for having me here tonight uh as it was said I'm Brady Dale uh a reporter who covers crypto oh I forgot to bring my copy my book up but Sarah left one here for me so that's great um yeah this is my book so um I just want to say I'm looking for my notes in my notebook here um all right cool so uh I'm really mellow about speaking in front of folks so I plan to talk about some pretty weird stuff tonight uh feel free to just like stop and ask questions as they as they just come to you it's like you're I'm not following this right now that's I don't mind I'm fine with it um so I'm happy for this to be like kind of a back and forth sort of thing um I am sort of assuming that everyone knows that this uh you know the Amazing Story right there's this cryptocurrency Market out there in the world uh this young guy became ",
        "1": "ridiculously wealthy he was in the cover of all these magazines uh everyone thought he was the greatest thing since sliced bread and then one day in November it all Came Crashing Down super hard to the surprise of basically everyone and people who said they weren't surprised or probably lying but some of them knew um I was surprised I'll tell you that I was super surprised and uh and then it turns out that several billion dollars were still sorting out exactly how much but probably like eight billion dollars was gone and now this guy he was gonna save the world and end malaria and whatever uh is in a jail just across the river um so yeah I assume everyone sort of like knows the broad amount of that story so uh so I'm gonna tell some chunks of store of stories in the book um I'm happy to Veer off into the directions that folks are interested in veering off into um but since this is an alternative investing investing group um I want to talk about kind of the middle part of the story which is the one that is kind of my favorite piece ",
        "2": "and really isn't about Sam doing anything wrong it's actually a part of the story where Sam is behaving kind of well um but before I do that um I think it makes sense because you know this is a thing about a book to like read a little bit of a book so um I'm going to read to you um from my I'm gonna read you my introduction to the book and I'll give you a little bit of a flavor for like what it's like um and sort of like where I'm going and I guess the thing I would say you all got it I hope you read it um what this book is it's the first book that came out about uh Sam and the collapse It Was Written really fast um because uh Wiley my publisher came to me with the idea to do the book and they they wanted to be in the first book on the market we already knew at that point that Michael Lewis was doing a book there's another book was doing on the same day as Michael Lewis's they wanted to meet him so what this book what this book is and ",
        "3": "what it isn't um what it is is an account of everything that we all that we know about Sam in sort of hopefully an engaging format um it also is uh a book that if you don't know a lot about the world of cryptocurrency and why it works and what makes it tick um it kind of attempts to answer some of those questions and make it make sense um so there's a lot of explanation of things along the way and that was sort of my intent in doing it um and I think it's kind of funny and white uh that's also the sort of the goal but it's it's not a book If you're looking if you want to if you want to learn more about the polycule or whatever um or like the weird parties that Sam had or like The Insider scoop of what it was like at elevated research that's not really in here and it'll probably be more in Michael Lewis's book because he actually was like hanging out with them this is a lot more macro uh but I think if you want to understand a sector which ",
        "4": "I expect is Gonna Come Back come roaring back again sometime in the next few years and will be more significant that time than it was this last time much like the internet was you know in the late 90s and then later in the 2000s um I think this book will get you a long way down the road but anyway let me read you the intro to the only couple pages long um I have to preface the intro when I read the people because there's a weird part about it which is not at all weird when you're reading it but you can't see it um so it opens with uh with like a sort of a journal entry which you can see that on the page because it's like all written in italics and stuff but it's it's in present tense um on uh what was the date how I was feeling December 1st 2022 was that writing this book it's about a month after after falling apart and then it actually sort of is like an actual book so it starts with that journal entry and then it becomes like a real intro and you'll know it's that journal entry's over when I say the name all right so the chapter one I want to believe ",
        "5": "I am drowning in Sam he's everywhere and unlike any other CEO after a comparably colossal unwinding he's not coming at me directly by a journalist searching his history no this Deluge is him he won't stop it's as if he can't stop I want to get the story of FTX down but how can anyone discern it through all the noise that is him that is Sam bankman free that is SBF that nasally excessively informed voice that just won't stop operating his version of events in his extra qualified statistically intended mysticism these words are coming to you from somewhere around the halfway point of writing this book it's December 1st 2022. tonight as my work as my work day at axios the internet native news site was ending I was trying to make some time to do a little bit of research on companies that one of his company's Alameda research is backed but then I got a message on our slack that svf the boy wonder who lost several billion dollars in crypto wealth was doing a Twitter spaces for those blessedly adrift from the gravity of Twitter ",
        "6": "spaces are where a few people can go online and talk with each other no video just voice well dozens or hundreds or thousands of others just listen interacting with a few Emoji space has become a big way for big accounts to broadcast and SPF since late November and here in early December 22 was all about broadcasting this was after SBF it made a morning show appearance with George Stephanopoulos which I haven't then which I haven't yet watched after a New York Times internet broadcast with Andrew Ross Orkin which I also haven't watched yet I'm the only person I know in the media who hasn't watched I'm too busy writing this book to watch a thing I knew would be there later when I was ready I plan to watch it later but now he is talking again to some random faux investigators on Twitter and I want to be Barbara Walters really I just haven't missed misfortunate hearing I listen to a little of the spaces but it was more aggravation and information there was too much of him I'm drowning Sam will not stop coming people say this Deluge is the master people Masterpiece ",

Sam Bateman freed offered a story that you wanted to believe the talkative boy billionaire would turn the wealth creation engine of cryptocurrency into a robber baron 4 chest with which he could fix the world he would be like the Andrew Andrew Carnegie with his libraries and who doesn't like those libraries there was one in my tiny little Hometown in southeast Kansas it's beautiful but ",
        "8": "Andrew Carnegie paid for those libraries in part by for example hiring thugs to Boston United workers trying to negotiate a better contract not great stuff as it goes some of our grandparents paid for those libraries and lost wages but SPF wouldn't spin up a war chest from anything nasty like air pollution belching factories and life-threatening working conditions SPF War chests would be created off the internet scratching wealth off like solid gold eight Flex from space money fountainer bouncing around something called a blockchain far from creating industrial scars in people's backyards blockchains don't even seem real so if a good guy could come along and make his wealth off that then help a whole lot of people with that money where could the harm be it was an appealing way to see SPF a lot of people got sucked into it I got sucked into it I believe that he believed the story he was telling Bonnie Tyler sang it out in 1984 and we all feel today just as she did then we're all Holding Out for a euro let me ask you this question what if we are all ",
        "9": "in fact better off for the fact that cespia never got a chance to take a crack at really going to town saving the world what if he was the very last hero anyone needed what if in fact the lesson of SPF is this the last thing anyone needs is a hero all right so that's how it starts and that's also kind of How It Ends uh so when you can kind of talk about that a little bit later but I guess for today's talk I think what I want to do is uh tell a little bit of the story of the book and then kind of walk through uh like I said what I think is sort of my favorite part of the book um and here's why so um the way this book came about was obviously well FPS that was a big part of it um and then Wiley came to me and they were looking for someone who could write a book about SDF and do it quickly and they were like you know uh it was mid-november at that point and they were ",
        "10": "like do you want to do a book about SPF and I was like sure why not and they were and they said do you think you could turn it in uh by the end of uh the year I think December it's November and I was like I don't I don't know if I can do that uh but I'm happy to give it a shot and uh so that's that's what I did and as it happened um it worked out sort of well for me because the first when people find out that I wrote the book that quickly the question they always ask me is uh were you were you already working on it and the answer is no sort of um I had an idea for a book already that I had done some amount of I've done a decent amount of work on uh and I had written a book proposal for it for folks who don't know about girls work it's a decent amount that goes into those it's kind of like writing a mini book uh and uh and that proposal actually did concern a piece of the SPF story um it wasn't a book about SPF um but he was in it and I think it's a ",
        "11": "really important part of the overall story so that's kind of the story that I want to tell you about tonight and I'm pretty sure I feel pretty safe as a bet that this is a piece of the SPF story that this this route doesn't doesn't know and it's it's really really weird um so uh here's the story so everyone knows that in um in 2021 uh that is when cryptocurrency started to have its latest all right which culminated uh in November 2020. in November of that year um yeah it would in Bitcoin hit its all-time highest 69 000. it was early 2021 in which people wouldn't really started to go it was just before uh the coinbase IPO it was it happened at the period in which um you all started to hear the term nfts on a bunch of those openings right like that's what that's what kicked the last bull run off uh but ",
        "12": "it really for those of us who were you know deeply in the industry and you know I I don't really invest in cryptocurrency but uh but I report on it you know I've sort of made my bet on it as a journalist um for those of us who've been around for a while the boom really kind of started a year before that before anyone started about it in this in this boom in this sort of mini boom that happened uh that was called the centralized decentralized Finance or Divine um and this time period it's it's now referred to as D5 summer um and defy summer was you know a really exciting moment for me as a journalist I had been you know covering cryptocurrency uh it's re it's we're kind of in a boring time right now you know it's like things get really exciting and then things get pretty boring for a long time and then they get really exciting and and defy summer was the first time I sort of felt like things were interesting again uh after a couple of years of it being pretty dull ",
        "13": "after you know Bitcoin fell apart really late 2017. and so here's here's what happens and and it gets to Sam uh towards the end so there was this D5 product so like you know this is a room that knows Finance you know what's one of the most fundamental Financial things that people do they lend money you know people put up some collateral and they borrow money against it right one of the most basic Financial products all right so uh in late 2018 I had written about the launch of this startup uh that was creating this uh it was creating a smart contract it's called compound and so compound was a product that exists on the Ethereal blockchain ethereum was the first blockchain that allowed people to autonomously run complex software uh on blockchain and what that means just to back up a little bit is um and this is I think one of the things that is one of the hardest things to understand about how things work in the crypto World um until blockchains came along ",
        "14": "every service that you ever got provided by anyone there was a person involved somehow there was a company you know there was somebody who you could call if something went wrong what blockchain's enabled is a world in which Services could be created uh that can function with nobody involved really no one like no joke no one um and the way it usually works is some startup will launch to make one of these services and the startup will run for a while maybe it's still running now um but the thing that's hard to sort of grab about these things when you're used to the world as it is is the startup can shut down like today it could go away like everyone could be you know thrown in jail somewhere and that service would still just run forever you know as long as it exists on one of ",
        "15": "these blockchains and and the way in a lot of the ways they get published you really you can't erase them you know so this service compound it was a basic money market built on the blockchain it was uh it just said you know you can come in and you can drop some assets into one of our smart contracts say it's a a million dollars worth of some asset right and if you do that uh we'll pay you a certain interest rate determined by the market for putting that in there and you can just do that you can just provide collateral for other people to borrow if that's what you want to do um but if you also if you want if you've got something you want to do um you can borrow some money against that and do something else and of course you'll pay a rate for doing that and and you know interest will approve over time and blah blah you pay it off and you get your assets back whatever but then all just occurs autonomously on a blockchain that was that was compound and and uh if this is interesting to folks one of the reasons why this was really appealing to people back in 2018 was you know there ",
        "16": "was a lot of people who had made a lot of money uh because they had invested in ethereum early they had youth they were e3ation cash War um so you might be a multi-millionaire in terms of Youth but she just had a normal work at a job you know you weren't you were already 70 000 a year as a developer but you had all this money but and you thought your eth was going to be worth way more over time but Southern token was coming out that you thought was cool you were to make a bet on it but you didn't want to sell your eth uh because you believed it was going to keep going higher and higher so what compound enabled you to do is you could just drop that Heath in there borrow some money against it and uh then make whatever bet you want to make and if it paid out you know Cash Out pay the loan off get whatever amount of your easy head back so this was a you know it was a real basic real basic service right so this runs along for a while people like it it's good uh in I think it was February 2021 uh there's this website um called D5 pulse it's keeping track of all the ",
        "17": "money that people have dropped into these various services and in February 2021 we're all very excited I ended the story about it I was just like whoa this is so crazy a billion dollars had been accumulated in all these various D5 Services the first time that that much money had had been built up you know it was like whoa a billion dollars it's wild uh and so a little while after that the guy who founded compound uh his name is Robert leschner really cool guy uh he and I have a decent relationship he likes to have he likes to come to me to release news and so he's like great I got a great story for you I want you to write about when you want to be the guy to have the story and I was like all right cool and yeah I was like what's the story Robert and he's like well we're gonna decentralize compounds and decentralization is one of the big buzzwords in crypto and I was like what does that mean it's like we're going to turn compound over to its users and I was like okay and I was like are you gonna do that he's like we're gonna make a new token and we're gonna start giving this token to everybody who uses compound for a four-year period And if ",
        "18": "you have this token you're gonna have a vote on how compound works if it changes what the rates are and things like blah blah blah um and I was like oh so it's kind of like Equity he's like yeah it's kind of like Equity I guess whatever but we're gonna create this token it's a really hot story and I was just like that sounds kind of boring um but you know okay I'll write it up so he announces this in like February of that year it comes out in June it launches in June and uh and then people start earning this compound token it's called com uh for all their deposits if you've got some money deposit and compound you get a proportional amount of sort of the daily mission of this new compounds of this new comp token you also uh get some money if you've borrowed on it so if you both deposited and borrowed you get comp on both sides this gives people very excited I remember as as this token was coming out uh there was this idea I don't even know how I got this idea but I was like the idea was the reasonable price for comp was probably like something like ",
        "19": "forty dollars a token somehow I believe that that was true and so I wrote about it Tom comes out and as soon as comp comes out money just starts piling into compounds just like crazy it's like people are just dumping cash into it to get this comp token at just enormous rates and comps value rapidly moves up to like 300 a token like you know almost 10x what I for whatever reason that was reasonable right and all of these additional things start happening because of this you know all these other businesses start taking off people are sort of pulling these crazy machinations to maximize the amount of pump they're getting the tickets it gets really wild and that's that moment when the comp token launches is the beginning of D5 summer okay so uh obviously what happens what happens when a startup is successful in something other people start copying it so lots of other people have or start making up tokens for the thing for things you might have heard this term I don't know uh liquidity mining that's ",
        "20": "what this was if you drop some money into a thing and it has a token you get this additional token on top of it right so liquidity mining is what got people very excited about geek okay so another application that exists on the ethereum blockchain and this is where it starts to get really if that's not weird enough it's gonna get a lot weirder is U.S one and so unit swap is this decentralized exchange and you know we all know it exchanges but the way most exchanges work right is you go to exchange you're like I've got this thing and I want to sell it and here's the price I want to sell it for and you wait around until someone else wants to buy it at that price that's how a base exchange works okay that's not how unisoft works the way unisot works is it's called an automated Market maker it just always has a buy and sell price for everything that's on it uh and you are trading with it and so it's a smart contract it's got a bunch of stuff inside of it the price for all the stuff inside of it is just the ratio of all the stuff inside of it you know so if ",
        "21": "there's only two things in there if there's like uh if there is one Eve and a thousand of a stable coin that's you know worth a dollar a piece then an ethereum is an eth is worth a thousand dollars right it's just and but it's obviously much more complex than that there's tons of things in there but just all the prices are just a ratio of whatever's in there that's just how it works and so this is a very popular Tool uh on the ethereum blockchain you can see if we just want to trade all the time they want to go to different liquidity mining Farms they've got a lot of there's a lot of exciting things that are happening and unisoft is where you go just like well I had I was you know I was trading this token and that was useful for this one thing I was doing I'm done with that I want to do something else pop over to unit Swap and get whatever you want you know and just like you don't have to leave blockchain it's all just like right there it is easily like it's it's like them it's like the uh it's the Grand Central Station of cryptocurrency you know in 2021 or 2020. and so but the thing that unit swap doesn't have uh it is what remains to this day you know it's very ",
        "22": "important tool in the crypto world what you know swap didn't have at that point unlike compound and everything else we come along is uniswap didn't have a token it it was like it was like no we're just we're just going to be in public good it's going to exist out there we've got a company that's you know trying to build it up it's making new versions of it but it sort of you know it just thought the whole token thing was kind of weird and they and they they weren't into it there was people in crypto who were sort of like of two minds of the whole token thing they just hadn't done one and this one-eyed crypto researching kind of call them a journalist this guy at the Block Larry cernack just tweeted one day because the thing one of the things about the way cryptocurrency works in the crypto world is all of these things that people build they all are they all make their code open source in general it's all just completely available online anyone can copy it anytime they want and uh so that it's really easy to you know sort of steal someone's work the various reasons why it's like hard to do that practically but you you know you can basically and Larry just viewed one day he was like ",
        "23": "what would happen if someone came along and just copy unit swaps code and said we're going to make a separate we're going to make a version of you to swap that just like has a token and if you dump money into it uh you earn you earn that token uh uh as it goes uh what would happen if someone did that and uh people were just like yeah wow that's a great idea and some Anonymous guy no one knows who it was this day there's a lot of ideas about that a few days later said I'm gonna do that and he went on Twitter his name was he called himself Chef Nomi and he said I'm gonna know I'm gonna launch an alternative student swap to uniswap it's going to have a token the token's going to be called Sushi and the new exchange is Sushi Swan okay and so here's the really strange part uh well there's lots of Parts but I when you when you put the way uniswap works the reason it has the reason it has money to trade in it is people ",
        "24": "throw their Assets in it they entrust their assets to be smart contracts uh whatever amount they want and lots and lots of people do this and when you and the more the more is in there um the better trading is on unit Swap and this makes sense uh it's like I said it's just the ratios right so if there's if there's a larger amounts in there then it's harder to change the ratio and so you have less slippage when people trade so there's there's a there's a strong people like it when there's lots and lots of money in there because that that lowers the slippage rate right so people dump money into you know swap to entrust it people make trades and every trade like any other exchange costs a little tiny bit of money I think it was like three basis points and those three spaces points just go back to the pool and so the more people trade on it uh you everybody who's in there gets you know gets a little bit more money they're all they're all earning off of those three basis points the more money you have in there the higher proportional and proportional piece of the of this rating rules that you get right and so um so the way that that's ",
        "25": "accounted for the way everything's accounted for in crypto it's not like you know there's not some database that has your name in it that says like you put this much money in there when you throw money into it a token comes back to your wallet it just says like this this token represents your chunk of the pool and you can actually you can send that to a different volume to the different person you can hand someone that token and that's there all it's just a receipt and it's a receipt that goes to anyone there's no name there's no kyc there's no identity check on it you just have this receipt that sits in your wallet right and so with the guy who created a sushi swap set was listen I'm gonna I'm gonna make this new exchange is going to compete with unit Swap and if you participate in it you're going to get the new sushi token that comes out it's going to take me two or three weeks to build it before it's ready but in the meantime I set up this other smart contract over here that says if you throw your receipts into this smart contract ",
        "26": "um that will allow me when my new exchange is ready to be launched to pull your funds over uh I will give you tokens now ahead of time I've already got the tokens ready to go I'll give you those and I'll give them to you at 10 times the rate that people will ever earn them going forward once the exchange launches right so typically but you know right now in in sushi swap I think it's like a hundred Sushi go out of day to everyone who's on who's on Sushi swap for that two-week period if you got in early it was a thousand Sushi swap a day it was 10 times better than it was ever going to be in the future and so a very crazy thing happened and this is sort of the classic thing in crypto is um what that meant was people started to pile money into unislab in this insane way so I don't remember the numbers they're in the book but it was something like a hundred million dollars or something that was in in a swap at the time when it's all when you know this ",
        "27": "kicked off and that was enough for them that was like what the market needed to function normally it was like it was going fine it was like 100 million dollars worth of crypto assets and unit swap at the time within a few days after Chef nobody made this announcement there was like two or three billion dollars that had piled into uniswap because people just wanted to get this token right and so so this is obviously very exciting for people and so folks are earning tons of these Sushi tokens and uh and a thing that was happening along the way is um a little bit of the sushi that was being earned was piling up in a separate account into a thing called the devil and and all of these projects have something like a devil and it's usually some chunk of their own assets that are just there to pay for to pay for developer teams going down the road because these things need to be you know updated that need to be changed uh they need to build new products to go alongside them and so uh so there was ",

        "33": "didn't steal anything you know um and so it looked like this was you know a person that we could all trust and so um from then on you know uh Sam kind of does what Sam does like you know he um he he goes on to launch a variety of his own decentralized Finance projects they all have tokens of their own that's important to the Sam story at the end because that's sort of the basis of where a lot of his money is um he gets super involved in this blockchain it's called Solana um you know it's a super fast blockchain it doesn't sort of adhere to crypto's uh essential uh essential values as much as other blockchains do but um you know if you get super involved in that he generates a bunch of new tokens off of it whatever there's this whole Sandpoint part of the book that you'll see if you read it um my favorite part of Sam's story that happened right around that and this was the moment uh that Sam really started to make me nervous is ",
        "34": "um in late 2020 uh FTX took a deal to buy the naming rights for the Miami Heat arena in in Miami Florida right and that was a um I think it was a 190 million dollar deal which sounds like a lot but it was actually over 19 years so it was just sort of a few million dollars a year they didn't have to know that it paid all upfront but I remember and I I never I never tried to claim that I saw Sam's uh fraud ahead of time I never critically in that I was I was in disbelief up to the moment that it you know became incontroversial incontrovertible that it was happening but that was the moment in which I I started to feel nervous about Sam for the first time because I'm old enough that I remember uh the.com boom of 1999 and 2000. I remember when I was living in Washington DC at the time I remember some random tech company it's in the ",
