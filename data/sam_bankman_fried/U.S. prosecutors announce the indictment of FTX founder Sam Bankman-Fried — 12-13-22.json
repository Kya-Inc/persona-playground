        "11": "for at all times safe segregated and secure but as we allege in our complaint that veneer wasn't just thin it was also fraudulent because in reality from ftx's inception in 2019 bankman freed began secretly and improperly diverting FTX customer funds to his crypto hedge fund Alameda research and as a legend our complaint he then misused those funds to make undisclosed Venture Investments lavish real estate purchases and large political donations bankman Freed's claims about ftx's sophisticated risk controls and other customer protections were simply bogus similarly his representations to FTX investors and trading customers concerning Alameda were also part of that carefully crafted veneer and were similarly false and misleading he frequently claimed that Alameda was just another customer with no special ",
        "12": "privileges at FTX but in truth bankman free directed that Alameda be exempt from the very risk management measures that he touted to FTX investors and to its customers he also provided Alameda a virtually unlimited line of credit funded by FTX customers and he also diverted billions of dollars in customer funds from FTX to Alameda bankman Freed's entire house of cards started to crumble as crypto asset prices plummeted in May of 2022. and as alameda's lenders demanded repayment on billions of dollars in loans but to continue propping up his Empire we allege that bank then freed diverted billions more in FTX customer assets to Alameda even as it was increasingly clear that Alameda and FTX could not make those customers whole in fact through the summer of 2022 he deferred he diverted hundreds of ",
        "13": "millions more in FTX customer funds to Alameda which he then used for additional Venture Investments and for loans to himself and to other FTX executives all the while he continued to make misleading statements to investors about ftx's financial condition and about its risk management and even in November 2022 faced with billions of dollars in customer withdrawal requests that FTX could not fulfill bankman freed misled investors from whom he sought still more money to plug the multi-billion dollar holes that he had created his Brazen multi-year scheme finally came to an end when FTX Alameda and their tangled web of Affiliates fought for bankruptcy on November 11 2022. that collapse has had far-reaching consequences for FTX customers for its investors and for its counterparties and our investigation into those consequences and to those individuals and entities involved remains ongoing ",
        "14": "but one immediate takeaway from today's announcement should be that non-compliant trading platforms pose dramatic risks to both their investors and to their customers among other things they don't provide them with the same robust level of disclosures and protections against fraud and conflicts of interest that's what traditional U.S registered Securities exchanges provide so it's imperative that non-compliant platforms come into compliance but as chair gamzler has made clear the runway is getting shorter for them to come in and to register with us and for those who do not the enforcement division stands ready to take action I'd like to recognize the incredible team from our crypto assets and cyber unit and from across our division responsible for today's action Evelyn Sue Ivan Snyder David Brown Brian huckrow Pasha salimi indicated this matter under the supervision of Amy Hartman Michael Brennan Jorge tenrero ",

        "19": "commission who supported the work I am proud of your your hard work your dedication to the mission of the commission and for always acting in the public interest thank you all right happy to take some questions number one um what is the situation with that tradition and finally um we didn't fit the profile of someone who you would think would be behind this I don't know what the profile is typically but he wore shorts to the T-shirt he was incredibly bright he addressed the fact that he didn't fit the profile in that part of the way he was able to fool so many people well you can commit fraud and shorts and t-shirts in the sun I mean that's possible too um so I think that that addresses the the last question in terms of whether we're going to bring charges against anyone else ",
        "20": "um look I can only say it this clearly but we are not done extradition is ongoing in the Bahamas I don't have anything to add on that next question okay so on the on the the timing of the arrests as I mentioned before I authorized charges last week Wednesday and he was indicted as a defendant in this District as of last week Friday and we had a warrant for his arrest and so the timing was dictated by law enforcement as opposed to any other considerations um including the timing of his testimony in Congress he was wanted for arrest and and we and we acted on that um in terms of the speed of the of the investigation you're right this is very very fast but I've also underscored that ",
        "21": "we're not done um but we have a track record here I think you've seen us you know this group in particular at this Podium multiple times since I've been U.S attorney announcing charges um in this space with with a lot of speed um I think that's a result of the collaboration and the hard work and the determination to make sure that we are acting as soon as possible and no sooner next question thank you look I think today's announcement is about one person um and and his conduct um it is fair to say that um this office and our partners um were standing with us today are very ",
        "22": "very active in this space I can't say anything more than that next question so if you're asking about who is cooperating who is not cooperating with our investigation I'm not at Liberty to say who has come in I will reiterate the call that I made before that if you have not reached out to us to talk to us I would encourage you strongly to do so and do so quickly next question right I'll take the last question first I mean I don't think it's fair for me to speculate as to what could have been done differently by whom and when ",
        "23": "um to prevent something like this from happening I mean we've alleged willful misconduct and fraud and so ultimately from where I sit given my role I view the fault as being with the people who we have alleged either in um you know the indictment or you know references CC's co-conspirators as being the people who are responsible for for this happening um can you repeat the first question again you said that any body does that means I'm not going to expand beyond what I've said previously next question um ",
        "24": "okay so that's a lot of questions um look I'm not going to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what we may or may not seek when he is here he's currently in the Bahamas and I'm not going to interfere with that that process by making a comment at this point in time um in terms of the contributions that we've discussed today and in the indictment um uh you know I'm not going to be able to expand upon who knew what um we have alleged what we have alleged and if we have more to add at any point we will we will do so then it's so hard to compare these things but I think it's fair to say that by any anyone's likes this is one of the biggest Financial frauds in American history ",
