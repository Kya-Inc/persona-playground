        "0": "the demise of algorithmic stablecoin Terra and its sister token Luna in May of 2022 wreaked havoc on the crypto industry check out this stable coin stable coin uh Tara's Luna breaking its one to one peg to the dollar plunging to as low as 26 Cents this morning what's happening with Tara USD how is it not a black eye for the entire industry it's one of the worst scandals in the history of the crypto industry digital currency prices were decimated and several businesses were forced to declare bankruptcy as their investments in the failed projects came back to haunt them but amidst the drama of those days and weeks after Tara's collapse Sam bankman freed who founded trading firm Alameda research in 2017 and crypto exchange FTX in 2019 quickly Rose as the savior of the industry SBF as he's also known and his companies poured billions of dollars of liquidity into the space bailing out businesses like blockfi and Voyager digital as recently as August SBF told CNBC that ",
        "1": "FTX had a billion dollars in cash to deploy at any given moment it's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain if we have like real blowouts and uh and it's not fair to customers and it's not going to be good for regulation it's not gonna be good for anything from a longer term perspective it's just that was what was important for for the ecosystem is what was important for customers it was what was important for people to be able to operate in the ecosystem without being terrified that unknown unknowns we're gonna blow them up somehow it seemed like SPF had become the White Knight of crypto the lender of Last Resort for an entire industry and for a while things were looking up the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies leveled out and developers continued to build new projects but now nearly six months to the day after Terra Luna collapsed FTX has filed for bankruptcy protection and Sam bankman freed faces investigations ",
        "2": "from U.S regulators and potentially the Department of Justice so what went wrong on November 2nd a report published by coindesk found that Alameda research a trading firm launched by SBF to trade thousands of digital assets was heavily invested in fgx's own token ftt it was a question as to whether or not they were you know fully solvent or fully able to to continue operations um to uh in the way that they have been after the report by Nancy EO Chang Peng Zhao tweeted that the company would be selling its ftt Holdings due to quote recent Revelations then there was this whole kind of back and forth over Twitter between CZ who runs Finance versus SPF and everybody from the Alameda and FTX side said there's nothing that there's nothing to see here we're totally fine we're completely solvent no questions asked but that didn't last a short time later Beckman free tweeted that binance had reached a deal to acquire FTX did about a day of due diligence looking through ftx's ",
        "3": "finances but Finance reportedly didn't like what it saw and backed out of the deal just a day later with few options remaining to say save the company on November 11th FTX filed for bankruptcy protection and Sam bagman freed stepped down as CEO it's a blow to the industry that we didn't need right now and it all started because of a simple tweet that CZ did because it created a run on the bank and it proved that FTX was actually insolvent which is which really is devastating to the industry which you can now see from the prices across the board it turns out FTX didn't have a billion dollars to deploy instead it had a gaping hole in its balance sheet a report from Reuters found that the exchange was transferring billions in customer funds to Alameda research to shore up the trading firm's business sources told Reuters that a large portion of that money disappeared and the top Executives had bookkeeping back doors to prevent some of those transfers from being noticed it's likely that they were starting to have issues in June and ",
        "4": "and maybe they were actually more wrapped up in the Luna and three arrows debacle than they let on and either FDA that's had a hole because of that or maybe or Alameda had a hole because of that and you know one was used to plug the other that's the only kind of reasonable way that we can assume that something to the tune of 10 billion dollars goes missing those transfers went unnoticed until customers rushed to withdraw funds amid uncertainty over the company's finances when you're running in a fractional Reserve process withdrawals are actually you know the thing that start to pull your lifeblood away so after the collapse of one of the most trusted names in crypto where does the industry go from here there's a lot of travesty going on at individuals families employees of the place people put money into the system indirectly and directly indirectly meaning there were people who trusted the whole Capital markets of crypto and now they've lost a lot of that trust on the retail side so the indirectly they've infected but I remember leaving ",
        "5": "there were people who put all of their bonuses back into leaving stock and then when it happened it seemed like it happened all overnight and you have families who lost their life savings there are similar situations here and I think those are the people that we should think about and try to support um as much as possible the first big issue is Contagion when other businesses could go under because of their ties to FTX the crypto exchange says it has more than a million creditors and up to 50 billion dollars in debt the other issue is making sure something like this doesn't happen it again some of the crypto space say the industry needs to step up and regulate itself because lawmakers around the world have been slow to enact guidelines others say this latest disaster could move Regulators to act much much faster I think regulation was coming regardless and now it will come really really quickly this is a case of unregulated centralized Finance running away with it ",
        "6": "again committing you know potentially illegal actions and so I think if we can take the time to educate lawmakers and and Regulators on what is decentralized what is centralized why is there dichotomy there and how massive is this separation ultimately we'll be fine but that that's really the education process that we're stepping into right now "
