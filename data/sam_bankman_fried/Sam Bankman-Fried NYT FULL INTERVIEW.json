        "1": "that's actually where the prophets were well I don't know that that's where I mean I think Alameda had made trading profits over the last few years but FTX had made profits as well um FTX had been a you know profitable growing business um and I was that was more than a full-time job I didn't have the bandwidth to run two companies at once I have the you know attention for it um and and again I was nervous about a conflict of interest between those two and so it was pretty intentional about not being uh very involved in what was happening at Alameda when did the co-mingling of assets begin so uh and again you know lots of Traders had open margin positions on FTX where they would have borrows of of us that's where they would be short some asset against uh you know against other assets as collateral um that being said I again looking through this now ",
        "2": "um I think that that position size for Alameda got substantially larger over the course of uh 2022 and that it was I think substantially larger by October 2022 um you know probably by July of 22 then it had been in April but it sounds like it's fair to say that there was always a connection between Alameda and FTX and and almost I mean not almost but from the very very beginning and then it never really stopped well I think it had been in some ways reducing I mean when you scroll back to 2019 alumin FTX were very connected in a number of ways um you know one of these it was that Alameda was the primary liquidity fighter on FTX it was you know 40 something percent of volume it was the backstop liquidity Fighter um and you know you scroll forward to 2022 it was down to two percent of volume uh we had a lot of backs off liquidity providers um uh but it still had a big margin position on and I ",
        "3": "I was failing to pay nearly enough attention uh to positions and positional risk on the exchange um and two Alamedas in particular um and I also frankly made a mistake that I feel pretty embarrassed to have made um I know a lot of these are but I substantially underestimate what the scale of market crash could look like and what the speed of it could look like but and how correlated it would be but does that just suggests that you were just hoping perhaps hoping against hope that this would all work out and that nobody therefore would realize what this co-mingling was all about so it's not how I viewed it and in particular again most of the firms had marching positions most of the firms had boroughs on FTX the problem here this one was this was too big it was I was surprised by this is too big it's it's assets that look it ",
        "4": "sounds like there were assets that may have been allowable to be loaned but then there were assets that weren't allowable to be loan no so uh I'm still looking into the details of some pieces of this but I do think that um in addition to um what I had seen as sort of a lot of the standard borrows here that um we scroll back to 2018 uh or to 2019 I guess um FTX didn't have bank accounts it didn't have any bank accounts globally we were trying to get them um it took us a while took us a few years um and you know there are customers who wanted to wire money to FTX and so I think in the meantime um some of them were wiring money to Alameda research to get credited on FTS and uh I think that was a substantial ",
        "5": "sum uh and I think that the ftx's internal accounting did correctly effectively try to debit Alameda for those funds but it didn't happen in the primary account and so it didn't happen it you know it created a discrepancy between the display of the account and what was really going on there and um I and I'm still looking into exactly how that how that worked mechanically but I that that did make that position size substantially larger than than I thought and and I think then what you would have gotten from uh from boost to normal Avenues what do you make of the argument that Alameda was used to effectively wash money into FTX that American investors who by the way were not technically allowed to even invest on FTX were doing so and FTX was doing it knowingly because the the know your customer rules ",
        "6": "were being flouted by using this separate vehicle uh uh how would that allow customers to flood to know your customer uh rules I are you talking about people who are trading on FTX us or are you talking about customers of FTX International International you just said that there was money being sent to Alameda and that Alameda was then providing credits onto FTX right but those users still had to go through to know their customer policy on FTS in order to do that in order to use that rant customers still had to go through fts's normal kyc onboarding so when do you think you knew there was a problem so um uh the time that I really knew there was a problem was November 6th um November 6th was uh that was the date that the uh ",
        "7": "you know tweet about ftt came out and I by late on November 6th we were putting together all of the data putting together all the information that obviously I should have put together way earlier that obviously should have been part of the dashboards I was always looking at and um I you know when we looked at that um there was a potential serious problem there and I you know alameda's Vision was big on FTX it had just taken a huge hit um it had taken hits over the course of the year but that was a particularly you know large and and one and very abrupt um and we're seeing a run on the bank start and that was leading to um I you know four billion dollars a day of a client withdrawals um at that point you know we started ",
        "8": "calling prospective you know sources of financing because I was I was nervous about what was going to happen there um you know if you rewind even a few days um I was I was a little bit nervous but not on nearly the same scale and I I was thinking about uh you know risks that were substantially less uh uh to to think uh a bit more about this um you know I was nervous that that would lead to substantial losses for Alameda um and that uh you know it would be a bit messy I didn't think it was existential for FTS I didn't think it was going to lead to a you know massive loss for ftx's customers um I was thinking of this as um more like Alameda is going to be really tight on funds and uh uh and that ",
        "9": "you know maybe it would end up having some small impact on FTX but not not a significant one not one that hurt customers at all um uh when you're talking about November 6 late November 6th then and and especially as we bleed into November 7th and 8th I start to become nervous that FTX is not going to be able to fill customer withdrawals and you know by by late November 6th I am very nervous about that and I'm starting to think about like uh emergency scenarios and I'm starting to think about like things might uh things might end quite badly here and and and the core metric that I'm thinking of there is will we be able to make sure all customers are whole and you know uh on November 5th I was feeling quite good about that on uh November 7th I was feeling quite uneasy about that I want to go back in time for a moment um this summer you were described uh ",
        "10": "oftentimes as the JP Morgan of crypto referencing the 1907 Panic that he helped prevents and you had purchased block Phi we're making investments in uh Voyager and all sorts of other things when you were doing that at that time how much of that was an effort to prop up the value of things like ftt which was the token of FTX knowing that if a company like block fi which owned a ton of it um that if it if it collapsed ftt would collapse and in large part the quote-unquote collateral that you had for Alameda would collapse so uh I don't think any of the borrow lending guests to my knowledge owned a lot of ftt I think a lot of them you know may have been using it as collat or ",
        "11": "you know taking it as collateral I don't think they owned it though um or we're gonna sell it and I think that most of them ended up closing down uh effectively all of their lines with Alameda one way or another and so at that point I think that that was close to uh at some cost and um and so I wasn't doing it as having any any impact on ftt in particular um uh I did view it as important for the industry's health I did view it as a thing where uh I wanted to try to keep the industry stable um but I don't think it had any you know really large ftt specific impact and did it have it you didn't think it had any impact it would have had no impact on Alameda or FTX if for example block 5 were to have failed I I don't think it would have had large direct impact and the reason I say that is that I believe that Alameda ended up returning the vast majority of its open you know borrowers of its marching positions with the bar lending desks in ",
        "12": "the middle of this year anyway and so at that point there wasn't that much left to to save from that um uh you know the uh at that point I think the bigger thing was just not wanting the industry to implode let's talk about collateral um because I think this is this entire experience has been a revelation for a lot of people about uh what might be collateral and clearly you were using uh ftt um and Solana and other tokens uh as collateral and part of that required you to mark them in a specific way a value to them um yep do you think that you were marking them properly ah in elmy's case I don't think I was marking them uh the way I wish I had from a risk perspective and I want sort of differentiate your like expected value or or sort of like Worth or ",
        "13": "something like that from security and uh you know I think that uh I don't have any strong statements to make about you know what value they're assigned from sort of like you know a upside perspective or even a median case perspective um but clearly I was uh I was not nearly cautious enough from a downside perspective from an extreme downside perspective and um you know I can tell you in my head I was looking at a 30 down move over a few day period as a sort of like extreme tail case event that you know we had seen once before um and uh and then you know what happened here was a I mean a 95 down move over the course of a year um and a you know 60 down move over a few day period with very little ",
        "14": "liquidity and all happening at once in all of these coins in a correlated fashion in which Hedges didn't mean as much also because this was a specific crash on assets associated with Alameda research rather than all assets and so you know even correlated Hedges had limited use there um and to run on the bank at the same time and all that are things in retrospect I should have expected might happen in an extreme scenario because that's how markets work and you know we've seen other examples of that in history where when things get really bad they get really bad for all of the relevant things at once in a very direct and correlated and quick way I want to go back to the black fight uh acquisition for a moment how much money do you think Alameda I'd say that they had a lot of  but that Alameda had borrowed from block five at the time of the bailout ah I honestly don't know but I I would ",
        "15": "have guessed it's like 100 million maybe a couple hundred million but I I honestly don't know the answer that it wasn't I wasn't like where I am it wasn't paying detail attention that's my guess and and were you using ftt and serum and other things to collateralize the loans at block five do you think I mean this goes to the whole idea of both the value of these things and also whether you were trying to buy block fi in fact to continue to support effectively Alameda or FTX right you know it might be um I I would guess it was but but you know to your point my guess is that like the amount paid for for Block fry was probably bigger than the amount that Alameda had opened with it I mean I I don't know that for sure again I I uh but I wasn't even looking at what that number was really but I think that's that's about right I want to go back to the Alameda piece of it for just another moment if you if you'd stick with me here you told investors and Regulators that you were not involved in Alameda ",
        "16": "decision making um and yet in the case Alameda invested 1.15 billion dollars in Genesis Digital assets um without your consultation or approval that that's the question and my understanding is you also served on the board of Genesis Digital assets and so I'm trying to understand how you wouldn't have been involved with Alameda so I was somewhat involved with uh Venture investing and that was done out of a separate entity um than you know any of alameda's proprietary trading uh than its activity on FTX or other crypto exchanges um uh but I was uh consulted on uh on some of it's It's VC Investments including with GDA what what are your lawyers telling you right now are they suggesting this is a good idea for you to be speaking they're very much not ",
        "17": "um uh and uh I mean you know what was the classic advice right don't say anything uh you know recede into a whole uh and that's not who I am I mean it's not who I want to be I don't have I I think I have a duty to talk to people I have a duty to explain what happened and I think I have a duty to do everything I can to try and do what's right if there is anything I can do to to try and help customers out here and uh I don't see what good is accomplished by me just sitting locked uh you know you know in a room pretending the outside world doesn't exist you're in the Bahamas right now are you in the Bahamas because you think you can't leave uh no I'm I'm in the Bahamas I mean I I have been in in the Bahamas for the last year and you know I've been running FTX from the Bahamas you know I've been running FTX digital Market our in primary operating entity down here um you know with with you know Bohemian ",
        "18": "uh regulators and uh you know others in in in in contact and uh you know right now I'm you know I'm looking to be helpful anywhere I can with any of the global entities that uh you know that would want my help do you think you could come to the United States or go elsewhere i i i to my knowledge I could have you thought about doing that I I've thought about it and um you know I mean I mean I've seen a lot of the uh obviously all the hearings that have been happening I you know would not be surprised if you know sometime I am you know up there talking about what happened to our Representatives or um you know wherever else is is most appropriate How concerned are you about criminal liability at this point so I don't think that I mean obviously I don't I don't personally think that I have uh you know but ",
        "19": "I I think the real answer is that's not it sounds weird to say but but I think the real answer is that's not what I'm focusing on um it's uh there's gonna be a time and a place for me to sort of think about myself and my own future but I don't think this is it like right now I mean look I I've had a bad month um this has not been funny for me but that's not what matters here like what matters here is the millions of customers what matters here is all the stakeholders in FTX uh who who got hurt and and trying to do everything I can to help them out and you know as long as that's the case like I don't think that I don't think that you know what happens with me is the important part of that and I don't think that's what it makes sense for me to be focusing on Sam help me with this ",
        "20": "um on November 7th you tweeted and then deleted a tweet that said quote FTX has enough to cover all client Holdings we don't invest client assets even treasuries we've been processing all withdrawals and will continue to be unquote you then deleted that tweet and literally just moments ago you told me it was on November 7th that things took a turn yep um you're telling the truth so things were changing fast and you know when you look at at November 6th I was feeling nervous but I felt like things were probably going to end up okay we still had I mean you know assets way larger than liabilities and um uh and yet there's increasing withdrawal of man but we were meeting all of it we were processing all of it although it was a weekend so we were a day delayed on a lot of wire transfers and stable coin creations and Bitcoin node was overloaded but you know their ",
        "21": "assets were continuous process by November 8th um I did not think the odds were that high that we were going to be able to meet all client demand and I was worried that there was going to be a substantial liquidity shortfall November 7th that was sort of the transition day and you know even just to start versus the end of November 7th I felt I felt fairly different um you know and uh I can't remember exactly who I was thinking or or or when I sent that but you know I remember trying to think about feeling conflicted about what to say and trying to think about what I could say that I believed and um you know by by not that long later I no longer believed that I no longer that no longer felt like it had much like that was a a at all reasonable representation of where my mind was at and I don't remember exactly when I deleted but I remember at some point I was like I shouldn't be there let me ask you a different question because this is all around the same time the New York Times ",
        "22": "reported uh that uh 515 million dollars was suspiciously in quote trans uh transferred from FTX wallets after after the bankruptcy filing yes yes and there have been accusations that this is the assistance effectively of theft where did that money go so uh I will caveat this by saying at that point I was being cut off from systems and so I'll I'll give you the answer to the extent that I know it um which is that I believe that a few different things happened within a short period there um I think that uh the uh us team took actions to seize some of the assets and put it in custody um from The Exchange um I believe that the um uh these announced that um you know the Bahamian uh Regulators um took some of the assets into safekeeping as well ",
        "23": "um around that same time um and I think they're made in addition to both of those also been uh some actually improper access of assets on the exchange and I don't know the details of that I don't have uh the resources to trace through exactly what happened there um and I don't know who is behind that third part I want to go back to one thing about the Bahamas uh but the payment authorities have now admitted effectively that they ordered the transfer it sounds like a certain FTS FTX assets to wallets under the control after uh the U.S bankruptcy was filed did you help them with that did you discuss that with them so I I you know can't discuss specifics but I will note that prior to chapter 11 having been filed um the uh Bohemian authorities had placed uh FTX digital markets uh the Bohemian entity which is the primary operating entity of FTX International ",
        "24": "um under supervision of a um a JPL system in the Bahamas with oversight from the Securities Commission of the Bahamas and you know were to my knowledge taking actions to protect fdm's uh you know clients um and and customers there can we just go back for just one second I and I apologize for for belaboring this point but we were talking about FTX and the derivative piece of it earlier um and I had made a note earlier about this uh because you had told the Senate so you were sitting in the Senate at the time on February 9th 2022 during a year and you said quote on FTX U.S derivatives uh all of these contracts are fully collateralized was that true yes and again FTX us to my knowledge totally solvent FTX us derivatives totally solvent and in fact I believe FTX us derivatives Ledger X may even be ",
        "25": "up and running right now I'm confused why fpic us is not processing customer withdrawals right now I would think it should be because I believe to my knowledge that it could be and could make all Americans 100 whole from this so I and and FTX us derivatives as I said there doesn't even allow leverage of any sort um it was you know close to a spot trading platform um and so uh yeah to my knowledge All American customers and All-American regulated businesses and exchanges here are um uh I think uh at least in terms of client assets are are are okay obviously I don't know what's happened with you know you can make your own judgments about the Enterprise value of those businesses but um over the summer you paid a 2.5 billion dollar loan to Barry silbert's Genesis this was in August and I was just trying to think through the Dynamics of what might have been happening at your Furman was wondering where did the money come from so when I say you did that I presumed ",
        "26": "that that's Alameda research that did that is that right yes that's the case so uh I don't have all of the details there but uh my understanding is that and I don't know exactly what's going on on genesis's side then I I don't know now um but um my understanding is I believe Genesis tried to call in a large number of loans uh from Alameda um I believe that that happened and uh that that closed down a lot of positions that Alameda had opened with Genesis and other trading desks and um I you know that was what I was thinking at the time um and that's I think what what happened there um I also think that may have led to an increase of position size of Alameda on FTX in retrospect um you you did an interview I think perhaps inadvertently uh over Twitter DMS uh with a reporter at Vox ",
        "27": "and had spoken about ESG but also about what you described as the shibboles of what it meant to look good in Corporate America today um and that a lot of the things that you were doing were not necessarily things you actually believed or believed in can you speak to that yeah absolutely and I was a a frustrating experience was not meant to be a a public interview it was a long time friend of mine who I stupidly uh forgot was also a reporter uh I thought I was speaking in a personal capacity um I I'm not sure what they thought the capacity was at the time but it certainly ended up uh being reported on um and you know I think what I'd say is look um I there are a lot of things I think have really massive impact on the world and ultimately that's what I care about the most and I mean I think that I think ",
        "28": "frankly that that you know the blockchain industry could you know could have substantial positive impact but you know I I was thinking a lot about you know bed nets and Larry about you know saving people from diseases no one should die from um about animal Affair about pandemic prevention and you know what could be done on large scale to help mitigate those those things I think matter and and and they're you know among the most important things to me um separately from that there's a bunch of that regulated companies do um to try and look good and um these are things that you know everyone who does them basically knows they're kind of dumb that these are not things that are making large impact on the world these are not looking at saving thousands of lives you know these are the kind of like uh you know if uh if like three different quarterbacks throw a touchdown in the same game for ",
