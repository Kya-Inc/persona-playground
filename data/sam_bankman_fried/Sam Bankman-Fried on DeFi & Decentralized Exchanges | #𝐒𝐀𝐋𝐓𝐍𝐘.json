        "0": "um but you've also been involved with project serum a decentralized exchange can you talk a little bit about that and how that works and um you know and maybe to slowly ease into the regulatory conversation um any sort of regulatory concerns you have around that yeah so really the genesis for that was you know we started looking at d5 a year ago i guess a year and a half ago now um and what became clear really quickly was that first of all there were some really cool things going on in d5 um and i think just to illustrate part of that if you have a d5 protocol right which which basically it's a company or a program or you know some protocol some sort of system which is built entirely into a blockchain it's all transparent it's 100 transparent it's 100 predictable what will happen given how people interface with it and that means that if a third party comes and wants to integrate that protocol they can and you can get potentially the sort of ",
        "1": "exponential explosion of creativity and innovation because all of these different parts can be composable into each other if you build a borrow lending protocol then any other protocol on that blockchain can integrate it natively in which just doesn't work in centralized finance in the you know in the same way um and so it was really cool there's a ton of hype around it um and it also absolutely sucked to use like it was unbelievably bad um and for those who i think for those who haven't used d5 and a lot of those who have it's worth just running side by side at dpi protocol and a centralized one just reminding yourself of how painful it sometimes is um and the reason is it was taking five minutes to finalize a transaction because the blockchain was completely overwhelmed it costs 50 to click a button because you had to outbid everyone else trying to get their transactions in um and what became clear ",
        "2": "really quickly was that scaling the sort of problem of scaling of blockchain wasn't one of the 17 constraints on a blockchain it was the single blocker to mass adoption you cannot have a billion people using a chain that has 10 transactions per second it just doesn't work like there's no two ways around it that math doesn't work and in order to take these programs and scale them to the masses um or even scale them to a single large enterprise you needed to get into tens of thousands hundreds of thousands millions of transactions per second just take your favorite big enterprise right whether it's a protocol a company a messaging protocol whatever it's going to have a million transactions a second that's sort of like what it means to have a billion users um and you needed a blockchain that could keep up with that so you sort of had phone calls with a lot of blockchains um and i don't know our call with salon was very different than our calls with other blockchains like ",
        "3": "sort of you know one of the first things that that nandholi said was like hey you know we've been thinking about like how many transactions do we need to do things like we want to get wherever we need to get and like here's where we are now and here's a place and go test it out and and and so anyway you know what we've um i've gotten really excited about is a lot of the applications everything built on solana um and i i think it's it's one of the few places in d5 right now where you can see it scaling to a billion users and it's not there right now um it probably has another factor of what 50 to go or something um but that's a lot better than a factor of 50 000. um you know and and and like tully said one of the founding principles of solana is that it gets better over time that it gets better with moore's law that it has an ambition to be able to service billions of users with millions of transactions per second um and and when you see that sort of the holy grail of what defy could become and ",
        "4": "soon we've helped um you know people build out uh dexes on the salon blockchain you know serum being one of them um you know we've you know i sort of invested in a number of projects on the salon blockchain in the syrian ecosystem uh we've worked a lot with jeremy um who uh you know circle has uh added salon support for uscc stablecoin which now all of a sudden you have sort of a massively scalable stable object that can act as a pricing reference and pricing currency for transactions happening and for payments happening on solana and again you go to a payment company and and you're like hey can you try to integrate crypto and they're like great we have 17 000 payments per second in this subclass that we'd like to test out on your network how does that sound and your your answer better be like yeah we can make that work rather than like can we try 17 without the thousands um and that's really where it all came from nothing is there yet no d5 protocols are ",
        "5": "at the level where you know centralized protocols have to be quaking in their boots because they're gonna be over taken tomorrow but that's not the goal the goal is moving making progress and building the fundamentals and this the infrastructure is something that could get there that could get to a point where real large systems decide that it is the correct decision for their business to build on a blockchain i think optimistically we're you know a year or two away from from getting real adoption there if the industry kind of builds its products right places cards right um and i'm really excited about sort of that progress "
