        "1": "and fell star Tom Brady and supermodel Gisele Bundchen are investors in the company you just need FTX the Miami Heat play in the FTX Arena and you might remember that Super Bowl ad the company did with Larry David earlier this year it's FTX it's a safe and easy way to get into crypto bag chair during the so-called crypto winter the 30 year old CEO has been referred to as crypto's white knight offering multiple loans for hundreds of millions of dollars to backstop struggling companies as the plummeting prices of digital currencies destabilize the market you said FTX has a responsibility to seriously consider stepping into the time to save companies why did you have that sense of responsibility it's going to be important that the industry is able to get through this in one piece it's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain if we have like real ",
        "2": "blowouts uh and it's not fair to customers it's also been called the next Warren Buffett today he said there is a parallel recently especially in this crash looking at which assets are in a place where they pretty badly need and you know finding places where hopefully I can simultaneously make good Investments and help backstop them and their customers in the ecosystem I'm sitting down with Sam bankman freed to learn more about his unique investing philosophy how he made his billions and how he sees the future of crypto well great to see you in person thanks for having us here of course thanks for coming so I read somewhere you said you always wanted to get rich but not for the reasons you might expect can you explain that so this was uh always is a strong statement but I would say is it you know in college I I realized I didn't want to go into Academia and I I started to get involved in effect of altruism which is basically a movement looking at if you want to have positive impact on the world how do you maximize ",
        "3": "that or at least do the best that you can like think about it not in terms of like do at least one unit of good um but instead of like how many units of good can you do given you know what what resources you have at your disposal and uh and so I sort of went to a lot of Charities that I thought were doing really great work and basically just ask them like what what can I do like what what would be the thing that I could do that would help you guys be as impactful as possible and they all said they wanted my money and not my time and you know if I was able to have a high-paying job I would be able to donate to them you know enough that they could hire a lot of people who were better than I was at um at growing out their actual operations and and that that would help them more than you know me working directly for them and so that that was the hypothesis and I you know basically thought about okay like given where I am as a physics major at MIT like ",
        "4": "I should probably think about where I might be able to you know donate as much as possible and uh obviously like finance and Quant trading came came to mind it served as a classic career path for disaffected physicists um and uh and so you know I'll applied to to work at Jane Street so effective altruism is basically making as much money as you can so that you can give as much money as possible away that's what it's meant for me but for other people right it might mean actually going to work directly for the organizations if they're able to be really outstanding at you know either working for existing great Charities or starting you know new philanthropic efforts but yeah for me in particular what it has meant is you know making as much as I can so I can donate as much as I can to what hopefully are some of the world's most most efficient effective you know Charities do you have a sense of how much you've given away so far yeah it's some definitional issues I think especially you look at like we've made a few for-profit investments in companies that we think are going to do good for the world and so I'm gonna you ",
        "5": "know if you put those aside for a second and you look just at the things that are sort of unambiguously uh you know philanthropy and it's it's a bit north of 100 million so far this year um and you know probably that's going to ramp up a bit uh over the next couple years do you have a sense of how much you're of your fortune you'd be willing to give away in the end I mean in the end I think almost all of it right like in the end the way I think about basically is something like well you know I don't know maybe like one percent of it or something I'll you know end up using on on on myself but but if I do well and obviously if if you know if I underperform then these numbers don't have to change but but if I do well I think that should be kind of Plenty for me you didn't own any Bitcoin five years ago is that true uh five years ago yeah that he's about five years ago that I traded my first my first Bitcoin what got you into it so I I just left Jane Street and didn't actually know what I was going to do with the rest of my life like I I'd love just basically I loved ",
        "6": "it there but on the prime I said there were just a ton of things that I could try and probably one of them was end up exciting even if I didn't know which uh and I basis like pulled up coin market cap and just looked at like the Bitcoin page on it I thought the like little markets have and it was super interesting because first of all told me you know roughly what the volume is where the the big venues were but also it lists out the price on each exchange and and today that's almost an Antiquated part of the product like I forget that that column exists because it's just reading out you know 23 731 12 times in a row but back then it was all over the place right and you'd see like 10 20 differences between different venues and then a few that are off by like 60 or something and it basically looked and said like if that's correct there's an Arbitrage like if that data is right there's a trade to do and so I just like tried to trade accounts and do it so as a quad Trader your mind immediately went to that Arbitrage yeah that's right and Alameda so at the time you started trading your Bitcoin and ",
        "7": "seeing these Arbitrage opportunities that was your own money when did you go and decide oh I'm actually going to launch a firmer on this so pretty early on I would say a month then we sort of decided it was worth trying and basically we just tried to do a lot of Arbitrage opportunities I'd say 90 of the trades that we tried to do we failed to for one reason or another the other ten percent were still exciting and and you're good enough to to make it compelling uh but when you when you look at what it takes to do you know an Arbitrage in crypto especially Circa 2017 2018 right let's even just take one of the easiest cases you could think of which is Bitcoin versus dollars on coinbase versus Bitcoin dollars on bitstamp right let's say bitcoin's trading at ten thousand dollars on one eleven thousand dollars on the other what are the pieces that you need to put together to do that trade well you need Capital right you you need some funds to do this with you need an account on coinbase you need a countdown bitstamp you need withdrawal limits rate limits things like that on each of the two platforms right then you go ",
        "8": "well how do you get money to coinbase in the first place you need a bank account and that bank account needs to be able to be willing to wire to coinbase and get wires from bitstamp in significant size each day right you need to build like Dev connections to each one of the platforms that you can actually execute this right that's nine different pieces that go into doing a Bitcoin Arbitrage on two US exchanges nine different pieces of infrastructure none of which have to do with recognizing or doing the trade so you were looking to sort of simplify that process yeah and ideally in the end what you want from a Trader's perspective is a button on the keyboard that you can click and if you click it it it sends the order right and then if you want to transfer funds you click a button and it transfers the funds you mentioned at one point in an interview that Alameda made a million dollars a day every weekday can you explain how that happened so that was there was this brief period in January of 2018 and that was a certainly a local maximum for for Alameda and and you know basically what ",
        "9": "happened was you know going back to sort of the you know examples of Arbitrage a huge huge influence really everywhere in crypto but Japan and Korea which were two places that saw particularly large um buyers of digital assets especially relative to the liquidity provided in those areas and so we saw for a multi-month period was elevated prices um in most of Asia compared to the United States because basically you know people kept buying and buying and buying in in Japan in this case and uh that drove prices up to a premium there's an Arbitrage in theory to do and and it was about a 10 Arbitrage where you could buy Bitcoins in America you could send them to Japan and sell them for Japanese Yen turn the yen into Dollars why we're back to the United States and you know in theory have made maybe nine percent post fees and you know in theory if you had you know 15 million dollars of capital or so you know some of it was always going to be ",
        "10": "stuck in one place or another but but high level you know you could make a million dollars every cycle of that Arbitrage and you know how long was the cycle why couldn't you just do this every 30 minutes and that's how that's how long it would take to do the trades and send on the blockchain the answer is wire transfers right one step of this is you end up with capital in Japan in in Japanese Yen and you have to turn into dollars in America and that took like 12 hours or so so it took a day each time to cycle and you know you'd only go on weekdays because Banks were only open on weekdays and you know for most of January 2018 that's what what we were doing was was you know doing uh Japan U.S crypto Arbitrage so essentially flipping Bitcoin from One Market at a lower price selling it at a higher price that's right those opportunities they still exist but they're a lot smaller today were you surprised at the time were you ever saying to yourself I can't believe how much money we're making off of one trade yes and no it was on the one hand intellectually I could say or lay it out and be like well look this happened and ",
        "11": "then this happened and then this happened and this had happened then you can make this amount of money yourself and and we're making exactly that amount like it was in once it was it was just exactly what you predict intellectually but viscerally it surprised me every day like viscerally every day I'd wake up and be like holy it's still there by 2021 you're on the billionaires list more than 22 billion dollars in terms of net worth yep what was it like to make your first billion dollars you know it's one of these things where like the real thing I think came a few months earlier like there's a time at which formally something has happened but the writing is often on the wall before then and I think it was like they sort of time when we served we started up FTX and the first Traders there are people we knew like we sort of reached out I'm like hey we built an exchange would you like to try it like I guess sure that's a favor right um I think the point that like I started to feel like oh wow this might actually be big is when we started to get ",
        "12": "registrations and it's like all right like all hands meeting who was it who injuries this new Traders the platform like you know whose uncle is this or and and the answer is no one it's like the answer is none of us had ever heard of or met the person and they found out about FTX organically and when that started happening and we just started getting people signing up for the platform that we had never met before that was when I started to feel like this might actually be real you felt like you made it at that point I felt like there was a pretty decent chance yeah and so as far as creating FTX why create an exchange when there were already so many big Global players out there yeah I mean the basic answer is that we didn't think any of them had nailed it like and and that was I think that surprised me it surprised me that we didn't feel like they nailed it in early 2018 and it surprised me in late 2018 that they still hadn't nailed it that like the things that we had noticed many of them were not fixed I think eventually ",
        "13": "as you started to feel like I'm not sure it's getting there like I I think we actually might be able to launch an exchange well before many of the existing venues would have sort of Incorporated the principles that we would be launching with how is it the case that you guys are so much better off than your peers if coinbase for example said trading volume was down 30 how are you guys immune from this I don't think we're immune from it but but I think there's two differences one is just like we put a lot of work into trying to you know really grow out our footprint over the last year which is counteracting a lot of it and some of that's just continually releasing new features new products new ways for people to use the platform part of that is getting regulated like we now have you know licensed offerings for our product Suite in most of the world you can claim Japan European Union Australia and others and then I think part of it is also just we have a less retail heavy platform and Retail tends to be more Market sentiment dependent who is your ",
        "14": "average customer if not retail most of our volume comes from customers trading at least a hundred thousand dollars per day of volume and so these are high volume highly engaged users and it's sort of everything from like someone in the crypto ecosystem to a small Quant trading firm a family office day trader is to larger Quant trading firms to institutions it spans a lot of different sort of demographics and countries and types of players um but they're all generally fairly sophisticated fairly engaged and fairly large volume you said your company's really operating everywhere what geography is the most important and driving the most Revenue there's no geography that's more than 10 or so percent of it and so really the answer is if you just take the world GDP waited except for the United States Iran and North Korea and and I guess like a few other uh a few other restricted jurisdictions that's a pretty decent proxy for it like if you want to know you know what fraction or volume comes ",
        "15": "from Japan right I don't know like six percent would be a reasonable place to start as a guess I think that's roughly its fraction of world GDP fgx in general has just seen explosive growth some estimates that say a billion in Revenue last year where's most of the revenue coming from and how much of that was some of the Acquisitions you did numbers are are reasonable um you know they're they're the right ballpark best guess you may see a similar ballpark this year obviously depends on what happens over the the latter half of this year we've generally seen sort of market market share growth between last year and this year contract the the market decline and you know where did that growth come from it's you know the first thing to say is our core economics and I'm sort of glossing over a lot of details here but this this is like correct for 80-ish percent of the revenue um which is that it's uh you know people trading on our order books um with an average fear rate about two basis points roughly ",
        "16": "and uh this is very different than what you get if you look at the economics of a more consumer-facing platform uh you know it's it's way lower fee higher volume you know we have 10 15 billion dollars of daily trading volume on the platform and still at this point yeah yeah and it's right obviously it's different on different days on weekends you know it'll be a bit less but what that means is most of our revenue is coming from high volume uses it's not say it's all hft firms because it's not it's a wide variety of Market participants but most of the volume and revenue are coming from the market participants which for one reason or another are trading significant size and you know we've been working on building out our consumer product especially you know with the the universe and stocks push and other things and as for the Acquisitions you know the core weight that we think about Acquisitions depends on the acquisition and I wouldn't say there are any which have today transformed the business but there are a lot that have played a really important role in helping to build out parts of it and there are some ",
        "17": "that may transform business going forward right like I think one of the biggest things obviously that we've been working on is uh getting FTX us derivatives up and running in the United States and you know optimistic that we will be able to uh to to get there you've been referred to as crypto's white knight in some instances really coming in with these bailout and rescue packages why take that approach we only had a few days to make some of these decisions what we basically came to believe was the following the first was that if possible it would be extremely valuable to the ecosystem to backstop some of these places first of all she's backstopping customers and making sure they're protected but second of all stopping contagion from spreading through the ecosystem right stopping it from being the case that anyone who transitively did business with any chain of people who did business with one of the troubled assets themselves became troubled and then the secondary goal um was maybe they're a good trace suit maybe there's an investment or acquisition that can be done at you know ",
        "18": "terms that we'd be excited about given the sort of Need for Capital right now but that was usually not the standard we're able to hold ourselves to you know in practice the standard was do we feel okay about this from a financial perspective like does this look at least mediocre like like not a huge loss in expectation maybe gaining an expectation hopefully maybe not was sort of the borrower that something had to cross in order for us to feel comfortable uh you know intervening there and and often we just weren't sure like you look at a lot of these cases you know the four days before they're gonna file bankruptcy and so with four days to do all of the diligence we could on the company learn everything about it understand the industry their business their customers understand how we thought things were going to unfold and then make a judgment call and wire money I think the the Voyager cases sort of an interesting one there what we ended up doing was extending a sort of two-piece line of credit and ",
        "19": "the first was was 70 million and that 70 million was money they could just draw on immediately no strings attached and we knew we might lose that then there's a larger line of credit which would eventually have potentially plugged our best guess at the time as to what the complete hole was um but which had conditions on it if there's just an immediate run on the bank here and the business is just going Belly Up and there's nothing we can do to actually save this like we don't want to just keep going through it we very well may lose that that 70 million I don't know if we're seeing it again and so be it like we we understood that risk going in do you still have still have cash if you needed to do another bank and we we tried try and like we try not to empty the Coffer so to speak we had a couple billion going into the into this and uh you know it lines up roughly with the amount that we'd raised you know over the last uh last year and you know on ",
        "20": "top of that we had been profitable so a billion ish to deploy yeah and again you get to definition she's here of how much do we really feel comfortable deploying I was saying that there's another all-part billion you know that that is sort of you know completely unencumbered certainly will get you within you know within a factor of two certainly if the right answer you said FTX has a responsibility to seriously consider stepping into the time to save companies why did you have that sense of responsibility it's not going to be good for anyone long term if we have real pain if we have like real blowouts and uh and it's not fair to customers and uh it's not going to be good for regulation it's not gonna be good for anything and so from a longer term perspective it's just that was what was important for for the ecosystem is what was important for customers and it was what was important for people to be able to operate in the ecosystem without being terrified that unknown unknowns we're going to blow ",
        "21": "them up somehow I want to talk about future of FTX and stock trading for a second uh so you have about a 7.6 stake in Robin Hood there are reports that FTX has been looking at eventually acquiring Robin Hood why do that when FTX is also launching stock trading so our default path here is you know we'll just build everything out right and we're going to try and grow our business you know as much as we can um I do think there are potential synergies between us and a bunch of other companies and I think specifically you know when you look at companies that have you know done frankly an amazing job at building out a brand and and way better than we have and you know have built out that real presence of Mind in uh you know in the west uh in consumers and have done a great job of building a consumer experience I have built up that confidence um I think that you know there are ways I think to work collaboratively with companies that could be really mutually beneficial and really complementary and ",
        "22": "that can span a lot of different ways of interacting right like we acquired blockfolio um for example um and you know we've partnered with block fi and and others um you know there are other uh cases where uh you know there are white label agreements there are cases where there's ways that we can help service each other in general we're you know excited to have conversations with companies that we think you know there might be uh you know Cooperative benefits in working with and you know in the 100 companies that that sort of would potentially uh you know fit that in our you know certainly our Partnerships team has been a little bit overworked working through a lot of those but uh but you know we don't have any like active uh you know acquisition talks uh with most of these long-term vision for FTX say five ten years down the road where do you see this company you know one piece of this is being a global platform where people can access liquidity um in a sophisticated powerful way one piece of this is being fully licensed and you know we think we are already by ",
        "23": "far the most licensed crypto venue and maybe the most licensed exchange overall depending on how you count globally um we are licensed in dozens of jurisdictions separately um and have spent a huge amount of effort on building that out but there is more to go especially in the west um and then the other side of this is trying to build out a really beautiful powerful intuitive consumer experience that hopefully helps to make managing your finances easier and more straightforward hopefully helps to you mean that you don't need to worry about the clunkiness of payments of settlement um and that things just work what about your own legacy Sam what impact would you want to leave in term I'm giving about my legacy like I care about the impact that I have but like it's not like the thing I I try to remind myself is like at the end of the day what matters is the impact I have not not whether anyone knows about that impact ",
        "24": "and and so I mean I still don't know what I'm gonna ultimately think are the most important causes I have guesses right now but I want to keep my mind open um to New Evidence you know right now things I'm focusing the most on uh is single thing is probably pandemic prevention and and so like you know if I'd say like what's the legacy of sort of what I'm doing right now would be that I helped support efforts that made it such that the next time that you know a uh you know pathogen was released it did not become a global pandemic um but there are a lot of other important things in the world um and uh you know I want to work on whichever those I can have the most impact through "
