        "1": "charged with these campaign Finance uh violations but as part of that cooperation agreement she now needs to testify against s SPF as he's known he was not offered um any type of agreement and she was pretty clear she met him while working at a company called uh Jane Street in Boston an investment firm he was she was an intern he told her about a company he was starting called aluda research where people could effectively trade um or invest their cryptocurrencies and she got in on the ground floor and pretty quickly this is 2018 it was clear that he was taking risks that employees of that company were already leaving and that she had to kind of steady the waves uh for a number of years but all of that fell apart just last year did she seem nervous did she seem comfortable what was what was what was it like when she was on the stand I think both for her and uh Mr Wang who testified today they're not used to this type of Spotlight and the spotlight is intense the judge a number of times had to have both Witnesses speak slower ",
        "2": "clarify what they're saying and enunciate because they're not used to this type of attention they're also very steeped in cryptocurrency they to explain to the jury which are your regular New Yorkers who were just selected last week what it means to trade crypto on a platform what it means to um use those funds because this is what they're alleged to have done basically FDX is the trading platform Alam research is a separate company but owned by the same people that was using the trading platform as a back door to back up the Investments so customers funds were being used to keep this company going until crypto collapsed in value and the House of Cards fell Ellison she pleaded guilty in December that's right to charges and then agreed to testify as part of all this is is she going to jail as well she very well could as will um Mr Wang who testified earlier today and another employee I mean these were all effectively spf's lieutenants and they've pleaded guilty to the government um showing their evidence saying yes yes he knew he was ",
        "3": "taking risks by using cryptocurrency to um secure people's Investments and in fact one of the things um the young woman said today is he would kind of boil things down to a coin flip sometimes and she shared that his psychology um was of the fact and this is something I had to write down because it so bizarre she said he would be interested he'd be willing to take huge coin Flips For example he would flip a coin even if Tails me the world would be destroyed but that heads would mean the world would be twice as good so as long as he believed that there was a huge upside to the risk they're taking he would green light that type of thing and that's what the prosecution is trying to get from her to characterize him as a willing risk taker and you mentioned Mr Wang that's the former Chief technology Officer Gary Wang did it seem like one of their testimonies was more explosive or more damaging I think what's most damaging from today and this is the second week of testimony now this trial could go for 5 weeks maybe shorter is ",
        "4": "that they are backing up everything the government claims Sam bankman freed did the defense says that no he was just an unwitting co-conspirator he didn't have ill will toward customers one of the customers testified they lost $100,000 for example for their Cocoa Bean Company just to give you a sense of who lost out um but the prosecution is making the case that no he knew exactly what he was doing he wasn't some disheveled um Tech guy who just wasn't um clear in these actions he was taking he knew the risks he forced his employees to take the risks and he could face if found guilty up to 50 years in prison so the other employees are trying to lessen what will be their jail time um when that when it comes to that the expectation is the trial likely goes until Thanksgiving the judge judge Kaplan has estimated we could be finished by Thanksgiving it may not take that long but with so much attention on this and remember billions of dollars on the line that this company held who knows where it goes from here ",
