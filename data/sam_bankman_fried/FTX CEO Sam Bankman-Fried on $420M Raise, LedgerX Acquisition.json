        "0": "ftx is having one heck of a year recently raising a meme friendly 420 million dollars from 69 investors at a 25 billion valuation following a 900 million raise over the summer the bahamas-based crypto exchange is striking sponsorship deals naming rights and spokesperson deals with the mlb nba as well as the nfl and their us arm has just finalized their acquisition of crypto derivatives firm ledger x joining us now is the man behind it all an ever expanding crypto empire ftx ceo sam bankman freed hey there sam so 900 million wasn't enough for you huh what are you gonna do with this extra 420 million yeah i mean you know part of it is that there are a lot of potential acquisitions for us to be making and i think you know ledger x was uh sort of the start of that uh but i don't think it's gonna be the end of it and um look there are a lot of countries out there there are a lot of markets that we're looking to break into ",
        "1": "and so i think that's going to be probably the biggest use of funds um but you know separately from that we're also looking to just continue making a lot of a lot of partnerships a lot of allies um you know firms to work with i also noticed you just most recently inked a deal with red sox legend big papi david ortiz to be an ambassador for ftx you have a very nice background there it looks very sunny in the bahamas you know at times i've seen uh antigua on the uh press news releases for ftx but now you're in the bahamas tell me why why the bahamas yeah you know there's a few things that came together for it i think the biggest is that they rolled out comprehensive uh cryptocurrency regulation licensing uh which is super exciting and uh you know we are regulated under the dare act here um and it's one of the few countries that has a comprehensive regime so you know we've been really excited about that you know outside of that um it's obviously it's a nice place ",
        "2": "to be um we've been really excited at the uh residence that we've been able to to bring on to the team um and you know crucially no quarantine to get in and out of the country which uh was not five years ago what i thought would be determining where an office should be but you know that's where we find ourselves all right santa tell the truth i mean you're hanging out with john carla divisini and see making risotto for you like it like it's a and that inspector gadget guy after reading that bloomberg article though that sounds like an awesome life those guys have do you get in the bahamas but uh but i i might you i would not uh shock me if i did at some point and uh you know i do think there's to be an increasing number of crypto firms here so in in ulcerative cola is your goal with uh ledger x to go after derebit is that is that your end goal is to to knock them off their perch ",
        "3": "so i think it's a little bit different because with darabit they're servicing the non-us clientele right now and you know we're already able to operate a number of non-us countries and we're getting licensing for further ones you know as we go um the i think the biggest thing with ledgerx is looking at the u.s marketplace and you know that's a place where no crypto derivatives exchanges operate right now um and you know we would be really excited um you know to work with the cfcc on being the first one there and and so i think it might be a similar product base um but it would be for a different client base sam we should have talked about this in the beginning but like let's just kind of some real talk here like is there such thing as too much money like raising too much money like i think there sometimes can be right you know i mean there are some benefits yeah so so i i guess like it really does like why do you need this much money um you know i mean there are you guys have been very lean so far that's been a great ",
        "4": "thing um yeah a lot can go wrong actually when you have too much cash so i mean can you just talk a little bit about what some of the dangers are here or some of the challenges because right now we're just in this sort of mania where everyone's like oh i just raised like you know a trillion dollars like i just it would just be good to like just be a little bit more kind of like real about this yeah so i think there's basically two big dangers the first um which i think doesn't super apply to us right now um but if i could if we went sort of too big on this is just diluting the company so much um you know ownership wise that the people who are running it no longer are the people who are incentivized and um you know i don't think we're anywhere close to that with these but uh but i think that is a real risk and something we see a lot of companies doing the second which i think is a bigger risk for us is just becoming distracted right and like you know you should be doing your job trying to grow the company and instead you're just growing its balance sheet way bigger than it has any need to grow and that it just becomes like a giant distraction you know and and and ",
        "5": "and that's not what matters at the end um uh that being said i think that uh the amount of money that we may spend on acquisitions over the next year or so might be quite large um i think that uh i would not be surprised if it was north of a billion dollars what's next on that on your acquisition wish list yeah so i you know they're a lot of this is looking at localized uh crypto partners or exchanges right so uh you know looking i mean there are several tracks in the united states but their equivalents in a lot of other jurisdictions and you know looking at uh what it would mean to acquire you know or partner with them you know whether it's for uh you know their sort of general localization their relationships their licensing um you know user-based fiat on-ramps off-ramps that's something that we're looking at we're just looking at simultaneously in ",
        "6": "many countries and we may end up doing a few of them um and then you know the other type would be some uh you know place where uh you know there's there's some app that has a lot of users but doesn't have the technology to offer them the services that they're looking for um and i think like blockfolio was a was sort of a typical example of that so sam in the meantime when when you get in a funding like this of 400 some odd million dollars do you do you deploy that into for liquidity on your exchange there was a there was a transfer of about 400 million tether uh shortly after this raise was announced and so the question is like are you guys in the meantime while you're looking for the acquisitions is that is that put to work on the exchange is it put to work in the crypto markets elsewhere what do you do while you're waiting so um i think that's a coincidence i think this 400 million is actually still in the bank account um uh you know part of the answer honestly just or sits there as like you know a bigger insurance fund um uh for the exchange and uh you know ",
        "7": "there's some use in that um i think that that it's not being put to maybe as good of uh of work as you can imagine it being uh put to uh you know fjx doesn't trade um and so you know ftx wouldn't be using this capital um to trade although i you know if there's sort of a next enough spare you can imagine uh finding ways to to to monetize that which i think wouldn't be crazy but i think the biggest answer is that it's it's actually doing surprisingly little until it's deployed um but i will say that i think we've deployed more than is public on acquisitions i think there are some deals that you know we've already started funding sam you're you're big on solana ftx us is launching solana-based uh nfts but the solana network failure that happened uh a couple of weeks ago is that concerning for you uh that wouldn't happen on algren according to critics and um there's concern that ",
        "8": "it will become more centralized so i think that it would be i mean a huge concern if that were a a commoner growing occurrence um i think it's not a common occurrence i think it's getting less common over time um i i think it's something that could theoretically happen on any network but in practice it's much more likely to happen on a newer network because just like fewer edge cases have been resolved um it's also frankly less likely to happen on a network that it has lower throughput because you're just stressing you know stressing all of the systems is there a concern that it is becoming more decentralized versus more decentralized i don't particularly think that that would be what it would do unless you saw the response to something like this being like a decrease in the number of validators and and and and being sort of like overhauls of the network where just a central server prevented um you know ",
        "9": "prevented any any uh any bugs are crashing and i don't think that's what we're seeing i think we're continuing to see you know the number of validators grow out um and uh and i think that like there is sort of a fairly um healthy and quick sort of response to this um you know sort of joint response to um to upgrade but uh but i think it could point in that direction if this became a really common occurrence that you know contrasting measures have you ever or can you personally disclose what your holdings are in solana along with the entities you control i i i don't want to talk like about specific numbers um but i'm a majority owner no no no i mean nowhere close to that um and i'd be shocked if any party were anywhere you know close to a uh majority uh owner of salon i'm not sure if any party is even a double-digit percent owner of it um so ",
        "10": "uh yeah it's nothing close to that and you know i also don't play an active role in solana uh you know governments are built out or or or anything like that um and you know and mostly just just passive and and a fan and a holder so uh sam touching a little bit on on emily's point earlier about uh having too much money and and kind of being in the spotlight do you think that that's going to make you a target of regulators and members of congress as as a to set an example first of all and tied into that uh of course we're seeing the rise of stable coins and the and the uh and the push by regulators to to go after those how do you think it's going to play out over the next couple of weeks when when this report comes out on what to do with uh stable coins how do you think they're going to ultimately deal with it yeah on your first point that's a real ",
        "11": "risk um i think that's absolutely something that could happen and um i think it sort of like is yet another reason that you know we expect to have a lot of eyes on us and that um you know we are are going to need to be um as you know cooperative and client as as as we can be um i think that sort of is over determined um at this point um we've been spending a lot of time and attention interfacing with lawmakers and regulators uh talking about what potential regimes could look like writing up some uh policy pieces on it and um i you know getting every license that that that that you know we think makes sense for us to get and and it's quite a number of them um but it's it's a big production and it has to be one um and i do think that if we uh you know if we have passed it i think that that there would be real risk associated with that um on the stable point question ",
        "12": "i'm i mean really curious to see how this turns out and um you know we've written out um a sort of outline of a piece on this uh on on our blog um about how one might approach it um but i don't know what the framework is going to look like if one is announced i don't know how much detail will be announced and i think it could be quite important for the crypto ecosystem in either direction sort of depending on what that looks like i think that what i would be excited to see would be sort of a registration based regime um center around transparency disclosure and protection of assets which mandated you know daily disclosures of exactly what was backing the stablecoin periodic audits to confirm that um and and sort of a few other things um which i think could do a lot to address you know a lot of the consumer protection and systematic risk uh concerns in the space um while still allowing stable coins to serve as an open efficient uh settlement method in ",
        "13": "crypto and uh and more generally but you we'll see what happens then we know that you're uh a generous political donator one of the top donators uh donors to biden's presidential campaign any big donations lined up for this november uh probably nothing huge um i never say never i haven't done as big of a dive as maybe i should have done but um there's been a trickle coming coming through i think some of those are public at this point um but i i don't think i'm expecting a massive splash can you say uh who which candidates you're you're supporting or what party uh it's it you know it it could vary and i think that like in general i'm looking at it much more from the policy side than from the political side and you know looking at it from the perspective of you know which uh which causes candidates or anything else um you know i think are going to be moving the world forward and and you know ",
        "14": "uh helping uh to to do the right thing by by asking and you know by by the country but not naming any names just yet sam not naming it and christine he's not donating to my school board campaign if that's what you're pushing for all right well morrison's in new jersey he's got a school board campaign everyone vote for lawrence "
