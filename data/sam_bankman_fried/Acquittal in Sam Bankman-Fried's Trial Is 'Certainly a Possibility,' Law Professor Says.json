        "0": "talking about this trial and also taking a closer look at the state of crypto regulation presented by chainalysis so back to the trial uh getting a different perspective here joining us now to discuss is St John's University's law professor Anthony Michael Sabino uh welcome Anthony um yeah and good morning good morning so yeah I'm curious to hear your your perspective I I I saw some of your notes and I I think you know I agree with a lot of the points that you raised I guess the question is is I'd be curious to I mean what is going on with the defense like I just be curious to hear like a professional opinion because for those of us who have been watching this trial um we're a bit confused by like just the defense strategy because it seems that you know there's a lot of like spicy stuff that you could be getting into the cross-examination and they're not really doing that they're repeating a lot of the same points over and over again they're kind of annoying the judge they're really you know sometimes they'll repeat something that they said five minutes earlier so is this some sort of like brilliant legal strategy that none us understand or like why is the defense acting this way um if it is a brilliant legal strategy I have ",
        "1": "yet to ascertain what it is precisely but like you I have to agree that I'm kind of surprised in fact no let me be frank I'm quite surprised at the lack of more melodrama here for example with respect to Caroline Ellison um the cross-examination based upon the fine reporting from you and your colleagues Emily uh indicated that the defense was rather mild with her I had fully anticipated that they would attack her for the reason of among other things her personal relationship with Samuel bman freed the that again because of that uh ending of the relationship she might be out for Revenge but moreover the fact that she was as I recall uh the co-ceo for a period of time at FTX so therefore I would have anticipated the defense would try to basically try to shift more of the blame to her and to basically say in in in conjunction with that well really aren't you the person at full so you're trying to blame s SPF uh I think the fact that as you reported uh she ",
        "2": "demonstrated genuine emotion on the stand uh under the prosecution's questioning uh is something that I'm sure the jury took cognizance of and the fact that the defense did not try to sort of return to that area and Tred to basically uh uh invoke a more emotional response from her uh basically defending her position her her own actions I found that a little bit surprising uh similar comments with respect to Mr Shaw yesterday again as I understand from your reporting and your comments this morning um he basically testified again as you said to the engineering side if you will but I would have thought that again a natural question from the defense would have been well sir okay if you thought this was wrong why didn't you refuse to participate why didn't you go to the government or an in-house lawyer or an outside lawyer sooner uh so again uh the lack of um aggression okay is is somewhat uh mystified but on the other hand I have to say In fairness to ",
        "3": "the defense is this uh judge Lewis Kaplan is an exper extremely experienced jurist I've appeared before him and I can tell you he was probably among the most non-nonsense judges down there he runs a very tight ship and you're correct uh if you're raising the judge's ey by uh being asking repetitive questions and returning to areas of examination that have already been dealt with okay that's going to be problematical you're going to basically get the judge against you uh judge Kaplan with all due respect is not known for his patience I can assure you from a personal level what I think is one of the most interesting things that's come out in the last 48 hours or so is these hints if you will these indications that the defense is saying that uh Samuel Beckman freed has not been getting his adero medication and that I think uh is uh quite fascinating because what they might be trying to do is say well again the legal point would be if he's not receiving his appropriate medication to deal with his attention attention deficit syndrome or whatever it may be uh uh that means that he can does not ",
        "4": "understand what's going on around him therefore he cannot fully participate in his own defense and they could be trying to position this for an issue on an appeal again assuming again the man is not acquitted it's always possible he'll simply walk out of that courtroom of free man uh but on the other hand I think they're also trying to build for the appeal um again I I I'm I'm surprised that there hasn't been more vitriol if you will uh more going after these Witnesses on a personal level because it would seem to be the classic play or the classic play out of the out of the defense Playbook is this is that when you have cooperating Witnesses you attack their credibility you attack their participation in the scheme you attack the fact that they have been involved that they've made a deal with the government so in essence they're trying to save their own skins and therefore your pitch if you will to the jury is you can't believe these people they're also wrongdoers they're also malactor okay they're trying to get out of this with a whole skin or otherwise minimize their time in a federal penitentiary so that's why they're ",
        "5": "blaming the defendant uh whereas jury this is the defense is saying to the jury jury you've got to look at them and basically say what's their true motivation all right what what how how can these people be credible if they have basically and in this circumstance particular to to FDX if these persons have deceived investors customers Regulators Etc then what makes today different in front of you jury if they've deceived others uh why are why would you think that they're not attempting to deceive you again in order to save their own skin you mentioned the potential for an acquittal and you know the reason I keep harping on is the jury understanding what's going on it's because we have these descriptions of like really long and laborious you know how does the cell phone work what are accounting practices is there a chance that at least one juror might say you know what I didn't understand what was going on there and this could lead to acqu and How likely ",
        "6": "is that uh it's I don't want to say it's likely okay but but I think that was Jennifer uh it's certainly a possibility okay we've seen this that is always the the problem with these um uh white collar crimes these complex Financial crimes in that you can lose the jury and again there's many highly technical issues here on the other hand as I mentioned before the fact that um the prosecution evoked an emotional response a very human response from Caroline Ellison okay I think that's something that the jury as regular people can really grond to okay and that might be something that they find persuasive but once again there's always that danger and I can tell you I've been involved in white color crimes and when it gets into the technical stuff on Wall Street uh the jury can be lost I was involved in one case in particular where the jury was lost and the defendants uh uh walked out so that's always the possibility and maybe that's one of the uh angles that the defense is playing they're allowing the prosecution to go forward and so bury the jury jury be befuddle the jury ",
        "7": "with technical issues and jargon Etc uh that the jury will basically lose sight of the lose track of the ball and they'll say okay well there's not enough here so again that could be something else that they're working on it could be but it it I mean doesn't that also work to the prosecution's favor like look we have it uh you know we've mashed these peas so much that there's no way you're getting this is going to go through yes that's equally so Sor I didn't mean to step on you Lawrence please forgive me step away I mean people do that all day very you're very kind first thing of the morning children yes that's the RIS that prosecution runs uh I will say again based upon the the uh your reportage which I've been following closely uh basically it seems that the prosecution has gone about this in a very deliberate workmanlike Manner and uh so far so good for them I would say in that they're putting the pieces together slowly and carefully and again it's highly technical stuff it's a lot of jargon okay it's a lot of you know ",
        "8": "Wall Street talk but they're putting the pieces together I think in a very understandable way for the jury uh so hopefully the jury will again have their eye on the ball keep their eye on the ball and we'll see where that takes them but again the prosecution has to be careful there because if they if they uh laid on too much jar and too much technical matters that is that means a possible loss of the jury and again the bottom line is this we're in America of course thank thank God okay God bless America but America you're innocent until proven guilty Beyond A Reasonable Doubt the defense does not have to prove in any way shape or form that SPF is innocent okay they don't even have to prove he's a nice guy all they have to put do is put doubt in the jury's mind and if this case becomes overwhelmed by the technicalities of it that could lead to doubt and that could lead to an acquittal that but that's a that's a game that they're playing that that the that the uh prosecutors will trip themselves up but but is the defense ",
        "9": "doing anything uh to to sew those seeds of doubt in the jury's mind it doesn't from what I'm gathering it seems almost like they've given up no I wouldn't I wouldn't say that because you never know I mean they could be playing the long game uh and so on so for and once again there's there's no telling if they if they do decide to put SPF on the stand which again is highly dangerous okay extremely risky I'll return to that moment but for example as you pointed out Lawrence uh yesterday with respect to Mr Sing uh I should say Emily mentioned this pardon me is the fact that um they basically went after him on supposed inconsistencies in things that he told the FBI agents and things he said on the stand now very quickly with that process that's what we call Brady material Witnesses are interviewed by the government the government takes notes those notes have to be turned over to the defense so basically what Mr Cohen I think it was yesterday was trying to do was saying okay Mr Sing you ",
        "10": "said a to the FBI in an interview a year ago and now today you're saying something else and all Mr Cohen has to do on behalf of the defense is basically say in essence what he's saying to the jury is this gentleman said one thing on one day and now he's saying something to you on the other day you don't need to decide which is the more accurate accounts you don't need to decide when he's telling the truth all you need to know is on one day he said something that he wants you to believe on another day he said something that's inconsistent with that so that means he can't be trusted that's an attack on his credibility and once again as we've been pointing out this morning they were doing that they were making some inrs yesterday with Mr Singh I really again my perception of your reporting is that they really didn't do that with Caroline Ellison and I was very surprised at that because I thought again as one of the leading Witnesses I think she was number two in the queue the bottom line was I really expected a fullblown attack against her and I haven't seen it maybe maybe they're waiting for more again as we see more of the professionals coming on the the technical sides what the ",
        "11": "losses were maybe they're going to attack the technical analysis and say that what happened at FTX was inevitable due to market conditions it really was not an improper shifting of customer funds it's been alleged so on and so forth so maybe again I still think these the defense has a few arrows in the quiver let's see if they shoot them off and if they land on target Anthony thanks so much for joining us this morning and providing that insight and Analysis it was a pleasure thank you very much it was a pleasure here as well good fortune everybody that was St John's University law professor Anthony Michael Sabino "
