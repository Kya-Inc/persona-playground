        "1": "i think with that i'm going to jump off stage and totally i'll let you take it away enjoy them hey folks um really good to be here so um uh sam uh do you wanna like i guess do you need an introduction a man that doesn't need an introduction you know i'm i'm sam i'm uh you know ceo of ftx and i've been spearheading uh project serum um and i really excited uh you know really excited to be kicking off the wormhole hackathon and um i know i i mean i think that this is i i think by some definitions we might be about to start at least a relative defy winter i mean i don't think it's going to be exactly like frosted over but but certainly compared to what we saw two months ago but i'm sort of almost excited for it i don't know i mean it's ",
        "2": "uh not not i mean my friend everyone always likes when prices are going up i i i prefer that too but i but but it does sort of feel like like not so much of winter that no one gives a [ __ ] but maybe enough of a winter that they're sort of like more focused on building and more focus on on useful products and stuff and on uh uh you know like i heard there's a new erc20 token today did you yeah i think like um what's interesting like i mean from a market perspective is that the expansion drives new teams to come and join um the space and then build um and usually that expansion is kind of like goes a little too far too fast um but at some point like i think we're gonna get like a continuous set of impulses in the space where it never feels like there is a winter which i think is almost true today right because bitcoin is ",
        "3": "going up like crazy but like there's no veggie tokens right to to bet your your money on yeah it's interesting actually like in i don't know i i i i sort of okay it's supposed to make a vacuous statement stupid it's like i wish i knew when bitcoin was going to go up and why but um um but i wish i knew more for sure what was going on now because i think there's some interpretations of what's going on right now for which the answer is like yeah i mean how many times have you heard that the institutions are coming like i think like once a month maybe for the last 10 years sort of like goldman sachs is always just about to jump in according to crypto twitter um but i don't know this sort of feels like at least institutions came you know a few of them at least yeah and maybe that was that was some some of this and maybe in size you know i think like maybe a few billion dollars worth over the last month i mean i i don't know for sure but you like i don't probably wait the ",
        "4": "various rumors you hear and like it sort of feels like like you know maybe microsoft yeah it actually was was just the appetizer here i i thought i'd be pretty cool you know if like um if the floodgates were actually i don't know flick gates are opening but maybe like you know a panel fell down on them at least and like there is a a little bit of a faucet so um let's gonna get a bit more back to the topic at hand [Laughter] yeah yeah i think i mean but this is all very tight together like i think i you know i've i've always kind of saw uh blockchain as a an implementation of an exchange like a really cool one right like but at the end of the day i feel like these systems are custodians uh even if it's something as decentralized as bitcoin or ethereum you have machines that are not you not your brain right that are custodies of things and ",
        "5": "you have cryptography that kind of protects that state um so bridging these systems i think is like a way for us to almost implement you know connections between exchanges like that aren't based on um a business kind of like negotiation between you know like ftx and finance to allow transfers between the two right yeah i think we're that that's like the boring world right and i think like the bridges that we're building like wormhole are this total automatic implementation allows us stuff to happen um without any paper yeah and it's interesting like i don't know what the end state is here like it's um you know the fewer bridges the better obviously um the not the fewer approaches you have the more bridges you have the better the fewer bridges you need the better um i but i you know what's where where does this all end up i don't ",
        "6": "i don't know exactly but it's certainly like every step that you can make here helps you know every step that you can reduce intermediaries that you can um and i think that like when people think about this i don't know what other people think about i think other people sort of probably think about like are they about to run away with the money or something i actually like i mean that's certainly a thing um one thing that i think about definitely is like march 12th um like when every sort of you talk about the need for a bridge in a place like the first thing that comes to my mind is um so it's march 12th and bitcoin just fell from 8 000 to 4 000 in in the course of like 12 hours um and now you want to do something does it work and i think the reason is that there's a lot of things that like usually you use them and they just work and you can't even tell the difference between different ",
        "7": "systems like it's sort of just like like yeah everything works you know withdrawals from centralized exchanges just work um and and then you kind of you're like okay but what about when you really need them what about when everyone needs them and everything is [ __ ] like what about when every part of the system is massively strained how fail proof is something in theory one really nice thing about d5 is it's still there um and i think for something to really be defined in some sense that that's almost a test i hold it up to is like on march 12th when everything's going to [ __ ] and everything is stretched extremely thin and anything that could shut down is starting to shut down not even intentionally just because like sometimes people don't have enough hands to not shut something down and i can like get into what that looks like but um you certainly having mansion exchange through exchange through march 12th like boy was that an experience um you know like which thing still worked then and i ",
        "8": "think that like that like one thing d5 should be aspiring to is is that the core things that you need still work on you know when everything is crazy and and i think that like when you think about bridges a lot of what i think about is is like you know between the various levels of centralization and decentralization is it's march 12th i need to get your assets from one chain to another and you want to use this bridge does it work and is it like you know reasonably prompt yep and so this this is like i think kind of like a key way to analyze these systems is like what happens when you know [ __ ] hits the fan so to speak can we still like actually trust this and with the layer one you kind of get this continuous you know massive um like bounty right but bug hunt on a layer one like if everyone is always trying to hack ethereum and every other layer one and these ",
        "9": "systems kind of become resilient really quickly you know or they die we see massive survivor bias are the things that were built you know lucky enough to be to make the right choices um so with bridges i think we'll see something similar like i think like because these are open and permissionless systems we're gonna start seeing like these kinds of like effectively long-running bug honeys that prove these out and it'll get there but it's just kind of to me always been a matter of time like it's just you know do you trust a new bridge or do you trust a bridge that's been running for like you know two years right and has seen some ups and downs through the the market cycles yep yeah yeah that's also true i think about layer ones obviously right no everyone kind of assumes that ethereum will just work um and us and every other new chain ",
        "10": "still have a lot of proving ground um to do oh but of course it's not it's only true in some cases like if you're there on march 12th one thing you know is ethereum didn't work i mean it sounds like a game centralized right it's not that it said [ __ ] you it well like i i refuse it's just like it became so massively outbid that like it was taking hours to get things through unless you're paying like you know ten thousand dollars for a transaction and so it didn't work in the way that matters and in fact like a lot of feedback we got from customers was you have to stop using erc20s like this it was actually quite bad for ftx's business that it that it used the rc 20s or march 12. and it was like a swift kick in the asset we needed to get all of our core tokens on non-ethereum chains like asap because the next time thursday march 12th like a customers are not happy if it takes an hour and a half uh for any deposit or withdrawal yeah yeah i mean that that that's awesome for solana but yeah ",
        "11": "yeah that's effectively like you know like building a system for a black swan event is is hard because these are not like things that are tested every day right nobody ever cares about it until until they get screwed um i think like um if you think of like decent like i i kind of start to think about bridges as decentralized custody and really all of these networks are a form of decentralized custody um do you think that some of these systems are gonna like like a layer one right has an advantage because we have fiat ramps to exchanges and other networks through a bridge and to like ufct stable coins like it's not like a a simple thing anymore where you only have one exit point back to ethereum right so in those black swan events i imagine that like the combination of all of these is what's going to prevent like um ",
        "12": "the whole infrastructure from falling over that a user like can go to ethereum right or they can go to ftx right or straight to your sdt it's a good question and i think that what you have to ask is like where is the liquidity during a black swan what still works right what still grounds everything and it's definitely different but i think one thing that i'll mention and i think sort of one interesting thing is the answer is like quite different for usdc versus usdt um and i don't even know that it's hard but it's not it's not it's not easy to answer the question which is more liquid in normal times or in black swans necessarily because they're very differently liquid um and you know usdc is the world's leader in um in uh primary uh liquidity and what i mean by is like creation redemption liquidity um so like it's calling card is that even when things are going to [ __ ] ",
        "13": "you send usdc to a redemption portal usually within an hour you've got funds in a bank account um it is it's not like as i mean it's sort of like in like 99 percent worked like i wish it were 100 but it that like it everything else is like 80. so it's it's like really running laps around the pack there and in fact almost every other stable coin like the more use it you're sort of like okay you know what this is actually just as good for like most days use but boy do i not think on march 12 it's gonna be fast to create and redeem i don't even know why it won't but it won't like there's just too many rickety steps in the process like there's too many people that have to be awake and on telegram and responsive and when everything's moving they've got other things to do like it's gonna get stuck between two intermediaries so that that's one thing about like i think that usdc is great for is like if you had to say like you've got a thing on the blockchain and it needs to be a dollar in your bank account ",
        "14": "as trust in as fast and trustworthy away as possible what do you choose i choose usdc and you don't need anything else accepting on usdc for it um on the circle portal so i'm fudging it a little bit like the coinbase portal is quite good usually but it has issues things get backed up so there's still some rough things around the edge but it's it's quite good on the other hand it's it's secondary market is actually not that great like marks are are like okay but but someone then tyler is complete opposite like it's you can create it you can redeem it but it's not the easiest thing too and certainly when everything's going to [ __ ] you should just add a few days onto your like expectation for that like when is when is the tether team gonna have capacity to listen to your redemption request not that they don't want to process it but that like they got too many for us is all like they're just clicking as fast as they can so i i do not trust that that that sort of like primary liquidity on a fast time scale and things are crushing but when it comes to secondary market liquidity ",
        "15": "um it often has more than usd does like it often has more exchange liquidity than actual dollars and so for that i think the important thing is being able to get it between wherever you're using it and centralized exchanges so like bridges have kind of a similar dynamic in the in the sense that there's kind of a a simple way to build one which serum launched with solid right which is a like a very simple multi-seg that connects your c-20s uh to a more complicated solution like full spec ipc where you're running consensus verification of both chains and yeah trade-offs there like that you have more automated system that's using kind of the foundational part of the code that doesn't require an intermediary versus but one that is much slower by definition right i mean slower to build it's a big thing like it just takes longer to make and and it's slower to run i i also ",
        "16": "think that there's some interplay there like i think that you could cut down like the sort of things you're sharing now like days to weeks to go through optimistic roll-ups is terrifying like that that doesn't work that can't be the answer um i i started thinking get it down to minutes to an hour but i also sort of think that's really hard like that's the sort of thing where like you have to cut you have to make the process extremely streamlined and extremely optimistic and really trust all the reward systems work and are not abusable and it's doable but i think it's like uh it's it's it like you know we tried to draft out it's like a 10-page paper just to draft out the specs and that was without building any single part of it and i'm sure like we even get into like what happens if there's a fork yeah so our approach is like actually doing all of these things in parallel because i like shifting code more ",
        "17": "more than disgusting design yeah so wormhole is like a simple multi-sig with some caveats that it's a larger set and this runway that's a lot of validators which we kind of have um like there's interesting parallels there right anytime you move ethereum to another chain you're depositing into a contract and you're trusting the logic of that contract like you're effectively giving this contract your your funds and then you're saying whatever logic is executing inside this thing it really controls who gets to spend and with a like client implementation you're it is equivalent to transferring those funds to a remote multi-seg that can create and manufacture those headers um at any time which is kind of a different way to think about it like people typically don't visualize these systems as multisex right like they think of consensus as a magical thing that just ",
        "18": "makes everything decentralized and impenetrable so which is i think like at the end of the day um probably good and bad because if all the actors behave correctly it is equivalent to that and there's just enough support to prevent bad actors from kind of running away with it that people can trust these do you think like we will ultimately need to have insurance for these for like bridges like do you like you do you guys feel like institutionals that are coming in that have some eth that deposit funds into uh a bridge do they want those funds insured so i'm gonna be honest i i have not been sold on d5 insurance i you might have centralized insurance for it i'm like not sold on like on chain insurance and and the reason is it's just so [ __ ] capital inefficient like like the whole thing with insurance is you're ",
        "19": "trying to protect against the black swan but that means you have to have the funds to pay out to a black swan sitting there in a contract certified definition is gonna be massive payout low probability which means in almost all worlds you have massive amounts of capital sitting there doing [ __ ] all right and and so with that that sort of like but but i think centralized insurance pools i i think definitely could happen um i get what about like the the fact that if i deposit like the the bond into an insurance pool i get a token back and that's not the same thing as eth right it's now eve plus the risk of this thing blowing up but it still has value so yes which which then i can plug into markets right and then trade and then and then things become really interesting if i push that thing through the bridge yeah um you can do it i think it's important and to be clear we just did that um it's i like it ",
        "20": "if you're thinking about that but if you go to uh go to you know any of the serum dexes right now i'll post a link in the chat um and pull up a market that i'll post a link to as well um you can trade exactly that for ok ex bitcoins um and so you know you go to any of these taxes and then you um you add a custom market and it'll just like uh post which market that is for people who are are curious here um i it's i you know you you can in fact um trade an iou for a bitcoin on okx which has had it just for all sort of frozen for the last uh what week or two and i think that's like super interesting um and and is is an example of that and i think that it's you know i think it's a super cool market and i think it's like you know super ",
        "21": "interesting to talk about i also think though that it's like not gonna be the fundamental thing people are trading like you know i i don't think that people are gonna be like that's gonna be what people call a bitcoin it's like you know i think people want a bitcoin to be a bitcoin in trading at one bitcoin you know and i don't think that the insurance bitcoin that's thought of as trading at a real discount at least if the discount is significant is going to be the thing which is going to be the fundamental building block of it of an ecosystem but it is like more transparent though right like if i if if i have a centralized insurer and i don't know what they're doing with a capital um yep the risks are like somebody bears the risk right usually the users oh yeah um yeah so like um so i i think like i agree ",
        "22": "it's i mean you can ask people like would you accept twice as much capital and efficiency in exchange for removing that risk i don't think people say yes like i just like there's a reason that insurance pools aren't i mean they're generally underfunded among other things like like like if you have an insurance pool and you fully fund it and put the dollar sitting there in a bank account for a world in which i you know in which everything goes to [ __ ] um that's like no one could could could do it you know yeah um so what are you what are you excited about bridged assets like what like what what is exciting to you about them that because they are effectively capital inefficient pegs right i actually have some guarantees that this capital is sitting in the contract in ethereum now you can go use it here and claim ",
        "23": "ownership of it yeah um i mean first of all i think they're just super crucial like you know they're they're what let you move between venues between chains and that's just like really fundamental to these ecosystems being able to to work and especially take off and like the place that i'd want to get to is a place where you don't feel like you have to use a bridge like i i think like the end goal here is like it feels like you have any you know you have one eath and you can use it on unit swap you can use it on serum whatever you know it's not like now we're gonna like go do a little dance to turn into the other even though even if that is happening you sort of like want it to feel invisible but also want to be as trustworthy as possible and i think it's doable to to make a lot of progress and i think wormhole's a pretty good leap in that direction i ",
        "24": "think i think i i think especially like a lot of people feel like it's i i i think like the current bridging solutions are all maybe closer together than some people feel like they're in terms of just around the space in terms of decentralization yeah um yeah for sure the the the way to i mean like there's the i think like the challenge is that the fully kind of the faster path both is ease faster for the users which i think is like a huge bottleneck right now for adoption it's just like latencies and these things are too damn slow solving that i think it's like the most important part and then like building out the kind of the iterating on the on the reward games to make sure that these things don't fall apart during a black swan i think is the second second second thing to solve and that that's just going to take longer in my view ",
        "25": "simply because that's a much larger problem but also i think solvable for the most part um yep yep i agree besides like um besides actually bridging assets across you guys see any else that you'd like like what would you like to see like being built just like in in general the ecosystem other than bridges um or like what what what like integrations that could go through a bridge yes um at a like a very simple way like the programmatic thing of transferring a near c20 is really no different than calling a function yeah right and then then you can kind of do like yeah from like a very it like an i'm doing an api call on serum right like not like not actually like transferring an ethereum for that matter um yeah that would be obviously so so that's when you start ",
        "26": "to get i mean it's really hard but you do start to regain composability at some point like at some point you you can compose sort of cross chain um you can't do it in one transaction which is you know so you can't do the thing where you block on on it oh you know where you say like i only do these five things but only if they all work but you can have an on chain call call a function on another chain theoretically if you have a bridge you trust and that's super powerful right then you can start using compound to power margin trading on a serum dex like ethereum based compound and i think that's that's like super [ __ ] awesome um and i think like more generally like that regains a actually kind of decent amount of composability um even without that though like with a tokens and c tokens and lp tokens uh you could can make a market on serum that gets yield ",
        "27": "i i think like st stanley mentioned this to me most recently but like yeah i'd be if i find it kind of cool if someone started like a uh you know whatever you know an 8th against a usdc market on on serum you can do it it's not hard just you sell it to bridge and then add a new custom market and it's just like your current usdc market except i'm building whatever risk ave has but also you get yield uh for you know your open orders on it um which which i think is pretty cool yeah that to me is also like really cool if if ethereum had enough like juice in the vm you could actually do a full round of consensus of solana and stuff it in the 15th second ethereum block so you could do like almost like a synchronous call which would be which would work uh so that that's doable the pro the problem is more computational and we could possibly let ",
        "28": "you do things on ethereum that you can't do if you're not doing this nonsense it doesn't make it faster than before so right yeah um yeah well one cool thing that i've been thinking about is um know like the this information that's basically computed in a theory on on solano now like using serum is really like much more stronger bounds in the security of it than an oracle because you have real market makers that take a position to take risk with that position so that spread is real right this is information that is like really hard to get to like if you move if you use an oracle you're kind of effectively always you know behind the times right that people can always arb your oracle news itself because there's really no not enough like skin in the game that oracle price right like serum data actually has skin in the game um yeah i think it's like i surprisingly ",
        "29": "few people seem to be really yeah i think on chain oracles like if your oracle doesn't need to cross chains first of all then you don't need this whole multisig stuff or or a lot of it you can just like [ __ ] look at the decks praise um which is nice and theoretically with bridges you you can bridge that across um you know you can you can bridge oracles directly which um reduces a lot of the failure modes of them and and speeds them up yeah so like i mean you could potentially kind of get rid of a lot of the the risk of custody by having this information that's basically computed on serum that being bridged over to ethereum right like you can move the entire like order book info right this is the spread and all the prices and that proof itself could like drive a uniswap market where ethereum users are not like scared of taking risk right yeah i agree in fact as you're saying ",
        "30": "you can imagine a lot of protocols that are building on ethereum can almost treat i mean this is sort of viewing viewing salon is a layer 2 basically where you have an ethereum something that sees itself as an ethereum based oracle relating to ethereum based protocols among other things but on the back end it's doing a lot of its computation on solana and so bridges over there does all the computation it needs and then bridges back the result and that to me is like like almost like the this idea of like i don't know i've been tweeting about this that block space is fungible it doesn't matter where this stuff is computed like we can figure out how to move these this data across and it's going to get cheaper because the cryptography is getting better like as soon as ethereum actually ships like bls 12381 signature aggregation is going to make moving that information over like a thousand times cheaper it's not gonna matter how many solano validators we have right it's just gonna be one signature ",
        "31": "check and then once you have that like i think like the the walls are going to really rapidly come down in terms of composibility so that's kind of part of what i'm i'm super excited in the future um so like i i don't know like the cool composition there would be like if you're using a serum provided price feed that you're also using srm and like composing that with tokens that are bridged over to um on ethereum um to me that's kind of like how you can start having like new business models that are like cross chain that are would not be possible in ethereum alone yeah i totally agree um and i think that like it's uh uh you know i think that there is like a lot of uh i think that that there's just a ton of potential there to build things that are just super powerful and that are that are a lot more ",
        "32": "that that that actually can use that power to to buy some uh you know to buy some trust in part of the trade-off fair do you think like that do you think the data like that that information is more just valuable or like me as a trader i like when i was trying to like build my models i was always like at the bottom tier of getting data because i'm i'm like an individual right trying to work right right get like uh option tick data from like options. or wherever they scrape it from right right um i think you have to ask like realistically speaking what are you doing this is all relative right like when you ask about you know when you ask about how much speed you need the answer is what are you doing you know and i think that like ",

        "38": "you start hitting throughput concerns there and i can tell you like right now where we are so like if you go to solanabeach.com you can see what the network is using and any sort of goes up and down with uh with stuff but like i think generally we're talking about hundreds 2 000 tps that it's using right now so it's it's like a factor of i don't know 50 to 100 away from being constrained as is um but and i think if that were the answer that's [ __ ] terrifying right like that that would be a way of saying like yes you can build things a hell of a lot more powerful than defy but like billions of people definitely not like you know it's sort of like you know you got your factor of 100 congrats or a factor of 10 000 or something but like it's still capped what what you can do um but i think that's not the case and yeah so they're kind of like um like the the kind of crazy part is that like uh when we started this we were using like much more expensive systems with four gpu cards to get the same ",
