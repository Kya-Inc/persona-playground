        "0": "Mr bankman freed you are now recognized for five minutes to present your oral testimony thank you chair Waters ranking member McHenry and all the members of the committee for having me here today to testify um it's an honor to be here um a little bit about my background first um I I grew up in Stanford California uh went to MIT where I majored in physics um and I spent three and a half years as a quantitative Trader after college um my goal has been to find ways to have positive impact on the world and and to maximize that um and to do so by supporting some uh really fantastic organizations um in 2017 I felt like it was time to try starting up my own thing so I I you know uh left my job and I moved out west and and ultimately got involved in the Virgin and cryptocurrency ecosystem um I I spent uh about a year trading and ",
        "1": "I in late 2018 began with my co-founders building out FTX FTX is a global cryptocurrency exchange we are the second or third largest exchange globally depending on what metrics you use uh processing about 15 billion dollars per day of trading volume on the platform uh about a year and a half ago we uh stirred up FTX us our United States based and servicing operations um a few points on FTX and the broader cryptocurrency industry um the first is that I think that the uh industry has the potential to improve a lot of people's lives um there are a lot of ways that this can happen I think that the payments side of this gets a lot of attention and rightfully so every time that a common consumer goes to a market to purchase Goods they pay multiple percent in fees to intermediaries um and that's if they're lucky when you look globally ",
        "2": "um trying to send money back to your loved ones at home is extremely difficult it can cost tens of percents in fees it can take weeks to arrive um it can get embezzled by various third-party scams in the middle and in general the Global Financial ecosystem is not one where sending assets uh to those who are important you is is easy to do um and this hits the people who are least off the hardest um who have the least access to the financial ecosystem as it exists today when you look at the number of people who are under ranked or unbanked both in the United States and globally it's indicative of a system that does not work for everyone and this is a product of the intermediation involved it's a product of how the larger institutions have evolved um and it's a product of payments infrastructure that is difficult and clunky enough to use that it just does not work for most people ",
        "3": "cryptocurrencies do provide a potential way to address a number of these issues making it easier cheaper faster and more Equitable for people to do what they need to do um to manage their financial lives um a little bit about FTX um you know we are a cryptocurrency exchange um we have a different structure than the traditional exchanges do as do many uh digital asset venues um we provide open and free market data to all of our users um on a traditional venue you pay tens of millions of dollars per year if you want access to the data of the market that you are expected to be placing orders in you have minimal access to the same tools and Order types that sophisticated trading firms have if you're accessing it through the normal set of intermediaries um on FTX all of our users have full access to the platform they have full access to the same sets of tools that ",
        "4": "institutions do and they have full access to all of our Market data which we make publicly available for free um this is true whether you're accessing it via API as a sophisticated institution via our website or via our mobile app um we've also put a lot of work into the risk controls on our platform uh this is true from the financial crime side where we conduct sophisticated know your customer diligence on all of our users um in order to identify any listed activity we monitor if I have multiple Solutions all blockchain transfers into and out of our exchange um it's true of our risk engine which is a 24 7 risk engine that is unlike the traditional Financial ecosystem where risk builds up overnight where there need to be separate missed risk models for weekends and overnight activity and holidays where hours or days can go by with no ability to mitigate risk to the ",
        "5": "system uh we have a transparent system um where all of our data is all of our Public Market data is openly available and free where risk parameters are transparent and we are already regulated and licensed we have many licenses globally here in the United States we are regulated by the states under the money service business and money transmitting regime and we are regulated nationally by the cftc where we have a dco a DCM a swap execution facility and other licensure um we strive to conduct all of our business on a transparent regulated manner um I think that it is coming and I think it is important and I think that it's healthy that the industry will be regulated I think it is also already regulated in a number of ways I think that there are points that need to be addressed um to give oversight of various aspects of the industry that do not have sufficient oversight right now ",
        "6": "um and I also think that it is important to do so in a reasonable and Common Sense way that understands the industry I'm happy to answer any of your questions thank you very much Madam chair uh in the last year the digital asset Market has exploded from about 500 billion to three trillion dollars and uh there's still extreme volatility it seems in this Marketplace Bitcoin for example lost half of its value over uh two days in March and uh it rebounded of course later on but there are many problems leading up to the global financial crisis that seem to be manifesting themselves in the market currently easy credit dear margin investing lack of transparency the lack of transparency that I'd like to see an adequate Financial disclosure is not readily available ",
        "7": "with the explosive growth in cryptocurrencies at what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble at what point should we become concerned about the possibility of a bubble so Mr Samuel bankman if you would please uh like to hear from you uh thank you for the question uh one of the really Innovative properties of cryptocurrency markets are 24 7 risk monitoring and engines we do not have overnight risk or weekend risk or holiday risk in the same way traditional assets do which allow risk monitoring and de-risking positions in real time to help mitigate volatility um we've been operating for a number of years with billions of dollars of open interest we've never had customer losses clawbacks or um anything like that even going through periods of large movements in both directions we store collateral from our users in a way which is not always done ",
        "8": "in the traditional Financial ecosystem to backstop positions and the last thing that I'll say is if you look at what precipitated some of the 2008 financial crisis you saw a number of bilateral bespoke non-reported uh transactions happening between Financial counterparties which then got repackaged and re-leveraged again and again and again such that no one knew how much risk was in that system until it all fell apart if you compare that to what happens on FTX or other major cryptocurrency venues today there is complete transparency about the full open interest there's complete transparency about the positions that are held there is a robust robust consistent risk framework applied and we're excited to work with the cftc on our U.S license and regulated venue um to bring a lot of this uh to us customers as well but I want to start with a question a couple questions for you Mr bankman freed in um Miss Miss Haas mentioned uh knowing your ",
        "9": "customer they avoid uh getting into the Securities transaction business is to the best of their ability that's one of the things they look for so Mike I've got several questions for you and and then one of them will be from completely left field all right so get ready for that one uh cryptocurrency Market exchanges such as yours are regulated through a patchwork of different state and federal agencies for instance some exchanges register as Money Services business with fincen at the federal level and may also receive money transmitter licenses and you talked a little bit about that in your opening um how is your company registered in these in this context uh yeah thanks for the questions and looking forward to the left field question at the end um uh in addition to a a bunch of international licenses um in the United States we are participating in that system you referenced with the money transmitter and money service businesses ",
        "10": "licenses um in addition to that however we are also licensed by the cftc um we have a dco a DCM and other licensure from them through FTX us derivatives and we look forward to continuing to work with them to build out our products we we just submitted a 800 page I believe uh proposal uh to them a few days ago I'm very excited to discuss um and we're also happy to talk with other Regulators about potential products uh in the United States all right well let's talk about another regulator that may touch on what you do um you talked a little bit about derivatives and the fact that derivatives were you know sort of a key component in the failure of the financial markets back in 0809 is FTX uh registered with the SEC so the core derivatives regulator is the cftc and you know FTX us derivatives is registered with the cftc um with the SEC we have Beyond discussions that are excited to continue ",
        "11": "discussions there we do not list Securities on our platform as of now although we would be excited to explore listing digital asset Securities in the future under the guidance of the SEC I will also say briefly that I would be excited to see a unified joint regime with both cftc and SEC involvement to create sort of harmonious uh markets regulations between spot derivatives contracts and other things all right now the left field question so you know our role here I mean there's nothing new Under the Sun the technology may change it may speed things up it may make it more transparent but it deals a deal who's taken on the risk who's who's getting rid of the risk you know who's the who's the middleman so one of the things we hear about blockchain is that it's invulnerable it's impenetrable it's uh you know something that's super secure in our our responsibility is to make sure that things are generally safe generally honest that people aren't swindled so ",
        "12": "I also sit on the science committee with Mr Luke Demeyer and and uh the ranking member was talking about we're at W3 all right in the science committee we're doing a lot with on Quantum computing and so my question to you is what threats or benefits to a blockchain system will come from Quantum computing uh well thank you for the question um I in terms of the threats I you know some cryptographic algorithms are not at least theoretically might not be secure under Quantum Computing obviously this is going to depend on the exact details of what comes um and it's important that you know if and when that comes um that you know blockchain security algorithms are resistant to that you know on the same front I think it has the potential to create uh you know basically new uh cryptographic algorithms that are faster that are more secure and that are uh you know more efficient ",
        "13": "um from a number of different perspectives uh so we'll we'll see what happens there the the the the use case for digital assets has partially been that that it's the stable store of value certainly stable coins solve that um some have pointed out that Bitcoin for example doesn't and you know Mr bankman freed um one of the ways that people have speculated that volatility is created in the market isn't by holders of the asset or hodlers hold on for dear lifers as has become known in the space but by the other big group that owns these assets which are Traders many of them trade on Leverage and so when you look at leverage you made a lot of news by saying you know we're capping people at 20 times leverage that's a lot of Leverage she also pointed out that the average leverage on FTX was around 2x so could you talk about the importance of Leverage in volatility I thank you for the question uh Congressman uh the first thing that I'll say is in cryptocurrencies in digital ",
        "14": "assets as like essentially every other financial asset in the world uh more volume trades through Futures contracts than through the spot asset uh the reason for this is basically it's more economically efficient um it's much more Capital efficient um the lack of an immediate delivery requirement on the physical uh creates uh a much easier ability for people to hedge exposure uh for people to express opinions um and and so for all those reasons uh you know I think that they're an important part of the digital asset ecosystem as heir of every other ecosystem um I'll just briefly say it's important to have robust risk engines that monitor uh the positions on these assets we've gone through multiple very large up and down moves and been able to manage positions uh both times um I'd like to focus on what I think is the crucial importance of having a secure digital identity for a crypto asset transactions uh first regarding controlled anonymity for a prevention of criminal activities it seems to me that if we wish to prevent crypto assets from ",
        "15": "being used for example for ransomware or other criminal payments that there is no logical alternative to having all crypto transactions associated with the legally traceable identity someone who can be extradited if they do something criminal and which these can be synonymous to Market participants and to the public but then must be capable of being de-anonymized pursuant to the action of a court in a trusted jurisdiction do any of you disagree with that conclusion that this is a necessary condition for preventing for example ransomware so let the record show that they no one raised objection to that statement so I think that's very significant so we have to start planning to for a system where um in a court in a suitable jurisdiction can actually de-anonymize any any legitimate uh crypto asset okay and now that that is relevant to to crypto assets such as stable coins or cdbcs ",
        "16": "that have stable valuations but still could be used for criminal activities um but for crypto assets which are speculatively traded then we also have an additional worry which is abusive trading practices in that case we need to know not only um the own The Beneficial owner behind a trade but there has to be a uniquely identified beneficial owner there has to be a regulator that can see oh this is a wash trade because you know even though they look like separate pseudonymous IDs they are in fact the same person um and and so that you know historically in in trading that has required to have a regulator that can see the true beneficial owners we've you know we spend a decade trying to get the beneficial owner under the Consolidated audit Trail which probably you're aware of so do you think that is also a logically necessary condition to provide and wash trades and similar abuses Mr Bank um yeah I'll say I I do think that it is ",
        "17": "and you know we uh conduct know your customer diligence on all of our users so that we do know who the participants are we're responsive to governmental inquiries about that um we're overseen by the cftc on that with FTX us derivatives I also think that this is a powerful argument in favor of having harmonized Regulatory and Market Frameworks in particular between different asset classes where if you end up with a different regulatory framework for the markets regulation of Bitcoin Bitcoin derivatives stablecoin stable coin derivatives you know uh ethereum ethereum derivatives and other assets you end up making it not just uh riskier and harder and more annoying for the user to access and more overhead for the industry but you make it hard to have consistent regulatory oversight um of a fractured regime no I agree completely look at I have been lurking on the Deep weeds for over a decade and trying to get this split inside Congress and between these C and cftc it just you know this is not something anyone would ",
        "18": "have created but have you had that discussion with yeah a lot number of you um expressed enthusiasm for having a single unified National regulator have you uh run that past the AG committee um I'll look it I know the answer to that I mean this is a this is a one of the original sins of Congress as it's constituted and Financial Services have been suffering from it for a while Mike and freed I'd like to uh start by asking you the first question uh FTX us has a derivatives platform and recently bought Ledger X as part of that is that correct yes okay thank you and that platform is registered with the cftc is that correct yep okay perfect so I just want to clarify something and this isn't to say anybody's doing any wrong it's just to get the lay of the land you also have an exchange for Bitcoin and other tokens but that is not registered with either the cftc or the SEC is that correct uh ",
        "19": "that's correct currently neither of them are primary markets Regulators for a spot Bitcoin to USD markets okay thank you and and I know you're registered as a money transmitter but that's not the same kind of oversight that we'll see from a federal Market regulator I also sit on the agriculture committee which oversees the cftc so a gap like this is especially concerning uh to me and the big problem that I see here from what I understand is that the cftc doesn't have regulatory Authority for spot trading of Commodities just their derivatives so that leaves consumers with inconsistent protections which is a concern that I have so Mr bankman freed you and both Ms Haas run exchanges but the investor protections basically can be whatever the company separately come up with and they won't necessarily be the same is that correct I completely agree with your worry we do in fact have much the same investor protections on our spot markets as on ",
        "20": "our derivatives markets but I would be very much supportive of a similar regime for spot Commodities markets like Bitcoin USD markets as we see for the derivatives markets well very good thank you Mr Beckman free FDX and ftxus have grown substantially over the past several years could you tell us about the economic impact from your perspective that FTX us has in this country yeah thank you for the question Congressman um in addition to obviously the impact in terms of the hiring that we're doing um uh and the support of a number of initiatives in the country related to job training uh and education um you know we're also hoping that we can help uh provide Financial Services to people who have not had easy access to those before if you think about the number of intermediaries that are involved in the traditional financial transaction whether it's using a bank or whether it's investing your assets that's a lot of points that can be very ",
        "21": "difficult to navigate for a number of people both in this country and in the world um you know we aim to be able to provide services to to everyone here um all easy to access on a mobile phone giving inclusive and Equitable access to financial markets that have been missing to a number of people so obviously uh you describe a great many benefits to the U.S economy so in your view how do we keep this Innovation happening in the United States so I think I'm optimistic that um you know on the regulatory side um we're not that far from that point and I think that there are a few clarifications that could go a very long way here I think that on the market side um you know having a framework with a single regulatory structure and it might have multiple Regulators involved in it the cfdc and SEC are both likely to be involved to some extent but having a single unified framework for futures and spot digital asset uh disasters could go ",
        "22": "a long way towards providing uh the sort of experience that you can offer in a lot of jurisdictions today I think that giving Clarity on the stable coin side of you know audit requirements for the reserves um but without sort of squashing Innovation by requiring only a very limited number of Institutions to be able to issue them it could go a long way on that side and then the last thing I say would say is moving away hopefully from uh a binary distinction of what asset um class you are a part of where one is uh very much close to that sentence and and moving towards a structure where you know we identify the necessary disclosures for certain digital assets related to the issuance related to the supply related to you know anti-fraud measures um uh so that they can all be part of our financial ecosystem with a you know appropriate disclosures and anti-fraud mechanisms and Regulatory oversight would be really valuable I'll talk about ransomware obviously we've seen ",
        "23": "exponential uh increase in number of attacks in the last months and years and it seems only be getting worse I know that crypto industry believes it can and currently does play a critical role in preventing illicit Finance including ransomware could you maybe Miss Haas or Mr bankman freed um could you describe for us how your firms take an active role such as working with law enforcement and other Market participants when these ransomware attacks occur I just would like to get a better sense of the role centralized exchanges play with the flow of funds for example um how do you keep track of tokens transactions and wallets and maybe including in your explanation discuss the colonial pipeline attack and how the FBI was able to retrieve a substantial portion of the ransomware payments made whoever wants to go first uh ASL jump in um yeah we work really actively on this in addition to all of the standard procedures that we have around surveillance of deposits of withdrawals ",
        "24": "and of our customer information we are responsive to law enforcement queries constantly um around this we are helpful whenever we can be both in terms of information related to FTX and our users but also you know we can extend that out to blockchain histories because it is a public Ledger we can trace these assets through and we say hey you should go talk to this place next this is where it seems like the assets probably ended up we have assisted in I think somewhere north of 10 million dollars of um of successful um uh seizures so far um in uh you know in cooperation with law enforcement uh related to this quick follow-up why if you can get a percentage back why can't you get all of it back if if you can get 30 percentage of the if again the colonial pipeline attack I mean 70 80 percent of the ransom uh was retrieved so what is the difference in the uh Bitcoin that was ",
        "25": "successfully retrieved as to the one right the one that was not um we can follow up with specifics on that case but I'll say in general that I any assets which are on our platform we can retrieve and and often there you know you might see a case where some of the people involved would send Assets in One Direction others would send it in another Direction and those others might not be in an attractable way but uh but anything that is on our platform we can retrieve sure thank you maybe follow-up question do you have any tools that we could help uh put in your toolbox Congress legislation that would facilitate um greater recovery percentages so I think that speed is frankly one of the more important things here I think like in any investigation the faster that law enforcement can act on this the greater the chances of recovery are and so I think that um you know we would love to just have standardized open lines with law enforcement where they know exactly how ",
        "26": "to reach out to us you know we can have phone numbers available um because yeah the faster that that action can be taken the greater the odds that the assets are you know were truthful "
