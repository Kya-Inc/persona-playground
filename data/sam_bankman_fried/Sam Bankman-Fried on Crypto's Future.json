        "0": "the coindesk spotlight is brought to you by nexo the place to earn on bitcoin ethereum and more to our viewers looking for something to kick off the labor day weekend we thought you might enjoy a special in-depth interview with sam bankman freed he is of course the 29 year old multi-billionaire and mit graduate at the head of crypto exchange ftx trading for malamita research d5 project serum and now the new owner of options platform ledger x we usually speak to sam about markets or how he plans to spend another funding round but today in this pre-recorded interview with first mover host christine lee you'll hear more about sam's personal side what he says is his mission and his vision christine begins the interview with a question about regulatory challenges with several countries issuing warnings against binance could ftx be next you know i i'm not anticipating it you know some of this honestly is just you know i'm fine it's obviously done fantastically well uh as a business and ",
        "1": "uh you know this is a reflection of that but i think you know when we think about the regulatory climate um there's not one way to think of this which is basically on a spectrum from like doing less to doing more and if you do if you if you do less it's low risk and if you do more it's high risk and obviously there's some truth in that right if you do nothing as a company then you haven't broken it like you're no loss break with no actions um but i think that's sort of an overly simplistic way of thinking about it and it's it's a trap i think a lot of businesses fall into and you know the way that we try and think about this is we want to build as ambitious of a product experience as we can we want to give our users what they want um but we want to also uh you know do this in uh you know in in a legal way in in a regulated licensed way um and what that means is often diving into a lot of specifics and so you know sometimes what this will mean is that there are some some sort of you know ",
        "2": "sophisticated products that you can launch if you get the right licenses uh sometimes it means that there are jurisdictions uh whose regulators uh don't want uh their their sort of users exposed to a particular product and so you know with the uk for instance uh you know regulators there clarified you know last year that they didn't want um you know local uh users to be uh getting leverage on crypto products and so you know we're not a uk company we don't have like uk advertising or really presence but we we went ahead and restricted uk users on ftx um to uh you know uh non i forget what the the phrasing is but you know sort of retail users non-professional traders um not being able to access leverage on the products there's a lot of jurisdictionally specific things that we do there um you know with the mind towards what are the things which you know sort of each regulator uh you know finds important and you know ",
        "3": "globally this means having a strong aml kyc framework but it also means you know thinking jurisdiction by jurisdiction being super responsive to what each regulator has said um and uh trying to be proactive about it trying to apply for any licensing that we can um and you know rather than just trying to kind of curtail the product um from the beginning thinking about what are the specific ways that are important um to uh you know either to to regulate license or limit the offering in specific places so you mentioned leveraged products ftx offers leveraged tokens cz the ceo binance came on coin desk can criticize ftx for having them because not many people understand them there was a huge fiasco nevertheless in may when the crypto markets crashed and users lost a lot of money on binance because the tokens the leverage tokens that they had seemingly didn't behave the way that they were intended to behave ",
        "4": "so i you know it's certainly among the more complex products and you know i mean i think certainly we've chosen different uh you know different designs there you know the reason that we've designed the r is the way that that we have is first of all it sort of is the best um mimic for how uh products are designed in other areas but but the second is that i think what we've aimed for above all else is transparency um you know everything about the leverage tokens on ftx is fully available um you know there are apis that return all of the relevant information in real time and historically uh we have web pages up that give all the relevant information about them um and and we'll give you historical data as well you know it's sort of completely transparent about exactly how they behave um and uh you know i think they're products that a lot of users like because they allow them to get you know 3x exposure without having to have liquidation um you know liquidations on their account and without having to manage the margin ",
        "5": "themselves and it can be useful product also for other venues that want to list them because these are tokenized rcp tokens but that don't have a you know risk engine or liquidation engine themselves and so you can serve offloads leveraged tokens so i do think that there are cool uses of that there are also sophisticated products and you know we we have a lot of you know explainers in order to trade them you need to go through quiz on ftx and we are you know everything about them is is fully laid out right how about that concern and a lot of regulators talk about this that you know a lot of people retail users may not understand these products and maybe it's not a great idea to put them out there and risk having that risk of them losing a lot of money i think we're sensitive to that and um you know i may certainly be interested in getting more easier feedback on them i will say that like we do have so in order to ever trade a leverage token on uh on ftx you have to first pass a quiz about how how they work and and and this quiz includes some of the you know ",
        "6": "sort of like the the intuitive properties from their names and also the unintuitive properties and has links documents that that you know it's going to explain exactly how they work in detail but but you have to to first sort of like you know correctly answer the questions about how they behave or in order to first treat them you know it's it's it's not a foolproof system but we see it as a way of um you know sort of raising the barrier for understanding to be able to treat them so that you know it's not you know not not only just like a self-certification thing but at least demonstrating some amount of awareness of it um it's something that some of our users really like um how they work is some some users don't like it um but you know i think it's also something we're totally open to feedback you know frankly from regulators on it you know if this is the you know earlier doesn't want we're happy right so just switching topics earlier cz told me that decentralized finance would eventually take over centralized finances and that's why binance is ",
        "7": "getting into the whole defy area is that something you agree with i don't think it's going to take over centralized finance i think it might grow a lot from where it is today you know right now it's it's you know five percent of crypto and zero percent of anything outside of crypto and i think that in the case where it gets huge where it does really really well it could get up to you know 15 to 25 of finance um on d5 i think it's gonna be hard for it to get close to you know 50 or 100 percent because it's it's fundamentally not super uh uh it's not like super computationally efficient um when you're using d5 uh you have to have like thousands of nodes computing every transaction um and you have just like limitations of like a minimum possible latency of around 100 milliseconds because that's how long it takes light to travel around the world so you know hft firm to hft firm trades aren't a great fit for d5 um you know video ",
        "8": "hosting not a great fit for d5 there are some things that don't really fit well that paradigm which i think is going to limit it from taking over everything but i do think that it could if it improves a lot in the user experience and and transactional throughput you know become a senior you co-founded project serum your entry into the d5 space tell me a bit about crm and the power that it gives users yeah so you know when we're thinking about certain what we're really worth thinking about is like okay you know you could imagine 20 something that you know of transactions happening in d5 what would it take to get there what would you have to build in order for that to be even a possibility and i think one of the core things is it needs to be really really high throughput um you know the largest companies the largest uh transaction facilities largest social networks they have millions of transactions per second and so you need to build a decentralized ecosystem with millions of transactions a second if you want to really reach that upside and so what ceremony is is it's built on salon ",
        "9": "which is you know as far as we can tell probably the most scalable you know the most scaling blockchain that exists today um it's at you know 50 000 or so transactions a second right now but has a coherent roadmap to grow that out to millions and no other layer ones are even close that in terms of their ambition um and then you know we you know help build out um a dex on on salon you know serum decks which um it's unlike sort of most existing decks is it's not an automated market maker it's not sort of like you know a sort of like simplified version of an exchange to fit in a load transaction environment is actually a full exchange with an order book a matching engine fully on chain fully decentralized which i think is sort of like is the core liquidity venue that you see across all areas of finance and you know hoping that it can serve as a building block for an ecosystem and do you see project serum evolving or complementing with ftx or lmd research in some way i think you totally could you know there's a lot of interconnectivity in ",
        "10": "the in the crypto ecosystem you know whether you look at you know solana and spl who can support by ftx where you know a lot of people use it as a ram um uh for d5 whether whether you look at uh you know or token listings frankly uh whether you look at you know liquidity in the serum ecosystem i think that there are lots of ways to cooperate and to work together although you think of it as fundamentally a different um enterprise than either of those um and you know a natively decentralized one so alameda research accounts for most of the volume at ftx at least in the beginning it did is that still the case or do you see or do you think that uh presents a potential conflict yeah it's a good question and i think it was stressful at the beginning because of that and you know when out when ftx was first founded alameda was a very large fraction of the volume there it was really valuable to help tx you know climb solve this chicken and egg problem of how you can get an exchange that has ",
        "11": "liquidity with no users or users with no liquidity but i also think it's not the healthy long-term uh situation and over the last few years alameda's fraction of volume on ftx has dropped enormously um alameda is no longer the largest uh even the largest trader on on you know ftx let alone the you know majority of the volume or anything like that and so i think it was a transition that absolutely needed to happen for ftx to be able to uh you know reach its potential um because it needs to be able to stand on its own as a product and it can now um and i think that's that's been super important to its first thing i think the big thing that happened there was you know it just got big enough that it made sense for a lot more liquidity fires on board yet people are concerned that alameda could be using data from ftx and trading against users yeah it's not i mean it's it's you know its account is is like all others it doesn't have access to you know special data it's using the api um you know same api endpoints that that other people are um ",
        "12": "and i you know acting as a uh as a liquidity provider there um as are a lot of other firms you know across the crypto ecosystem and the wider financial ecosystem um i i totally understand the concern but uh you know it's uh that's never been division for ftx um you built solana you built on solana because you felt it could scale why not use ethereum and do you believe that solana could overtake ethereum eventually so uh it depends on what metrics are using um certainly by you know transaction count i think it already has um but um you know i think the scalability was a big thing in u.s alliance it's at 50 ktps right now it has a roadmap to scale that up to millions over the next few years ethereum's at 10 transactions a second or so right now and it has a roadmap to scale that up to thousands um you know with these 2.0 and i i think that for some things that's fantastic but for a lot of applications that's not ",
        "13": "enough you know i mean i can say fts alone right now has tens of thousands of you know effective transactions per second going through it as do most major exchanges so you can't even fit a single large centralized exchange on uh ioni on on a chart of d2 and so i think this can be a big blocker against some sorts of of applications growing on that ecosystem and i think you just need a layer one uh or at least whatever chain it's effectively operating on to be able to scale up to millions of tps to reach the upside i think that's not the vision for ethereum you know it may be great for other things but i think for like the most demanding uh applications it's not the right sex rate so most people in the united states don't know who you are yet but you could become web 3's mark zuckerberg uh facebook's motto you know back in the day was move fast and break things do you have a mantra yeah um you know there's a time when that or some resemblance i think ",
        "14": "to our mantra and that's definitely changed um because one thing that that very quickly became clear to us is customers don't like broken exchanges um and that sounds silly but if your social network goes down for an hour once like fine i'll go eat dinner i can i can i can post on twitter later if your exchange goes down for an hour you can't say fine i'll buy bitcoin at 28 000 in an hour it might not be trading there in an hour and and so you know it's the the uptime requirements for an exchange are way way higher um and so i think that you know to the extent that we have a mantra it's you know it's almost the absence of one but it's sort of like you know take each situation as it is and do the right thing in it and that sounds really silly and it sounds like okay duh that's that's just like you know definitely true but what we see again and again is a lot of organizations will get caught in these traps where there will be a situation and there will ",
        "15": "be like a clearly right approach to it and it won't be the approach they take and when you try and drill into why you get this very confusing messy answer which is some combination that's not really how we do things like it's not really how we're structured like it's not how the midi works or the chain of command works and and i think like our our philosophy is like we want to do the right things we want to build the right product we want to do it quickly when i do it well and and we want to build a nimble organization that can directly do that and you know if there's someone who is doing something that you have input on you should go talk directly to them there shouldn't be any chain of command you have to go through um so that obviously you can if you want to but like by default you shouldn't um and that you know we're totally open to considering you know we we don't you know when there's sort of a new feature proposed we very rarely respond like no that's not what ftx does that's not our wheelhouse you know instead we're like huh that's interesting like is there a lot of value there do we think we could become good ",
        "16": "at that do we think it you know it's worth the effort to and if so we'll try and do it even if it's totally new are you looking to dominate the digital financial world um i not all of it um i think that there's uh there's a lot of pieces of it that i think we could grow a ton in and add a ton to um but i mean at some point you're just like training with yourself which is stupid and also kind of like dubiously legal um and and and so like obviously like you know what is like what is that they serve a piece of infrastructure right and so um you know if texas is not the buyer it's not the seller it's not creating the demand or the supply what it is is it's building out the infrastructure and tooling to allow people to do the things that they want to do and that's sort of how i think about it most and so when i think about you know what areas of you know the digital ecosystem and you know especially the digital financial ecosystem it would make sense for fjx to try and become vegan you know what i think about is in every area what does the infrastructure look like and is that ",
        "17": "something that fbx should be trying to provide rather than like you know but but not sort of thinking about like well where's the doc you know should it be the buy or sell demands that's that's not what ftx does okay well nevertheless you're making your presence known you've recently announced your partnership with tom brady and gisele bundchen you first appeared in a conversation with tom brady at consensus by coindesk this past may we'd love to be able to take the credit but maybe you can tell me more about that how that relationship came about uh yeah it's a ton of fun so i think we originally reached out to serve them and their agents and and started talking um you know just sort of kicking the tires on whether there's a partnership there that made sense and i think what quickly became and you know we did it because i think they're sort of like you know really transcend their genres to kind of a an impressive degree and and they have sort of an audience and um and and you know personality brand that that really is a lot bigger than like you know just ",
        "18": "football or or modeling um and and i think that like one of the uh that's sort of like obviously one thing we're looking for but the other big thing which is that we were excited to deal with them they're excited to deal with us that's for so much it's worth so much more than almost anything else that you know they're just like i mean you know tom's excited about crypto and and about exploring it more and has been for a while before before we ever met and i think she's always really excited to work with us on the foundation and and and you know that just means there's going to be so much more that we can do together well yeah giselle is taking a charitable role i understand tom brady will be a spokesperson and i understand charity is very important to you you also have the mlb sponsorships ftx arena which was is the arena where the my miami heat play you know a lot of crypto bros use their wealth to party and live a hedonistic lifestyle yet i'm told you still live with roommates you sleep on a bean bag in your office and you believe in effective altruism so first of all ",
        "19": "i is it still true that you live with roommates second how often do you really sleep on that beanbag and third tell me how you got into effective altruism uh yeah i'm i'm at my apartment right now with roommates who are probably asleep hopefully still asleep and they're walking um uh uh i sleep on beanbag most nights um i i think more than half the time that i sleep i am uh on the bike next to my desk and it it it's sort of uh unusual but i find that it helps me focus i find that it helps me keep concentration sort of keep my mental space um focused rather than having to sort of like relearn everything each morning um and and reboot up um you know in terms of you know effective altruism i sort of got into it in in college originally i sort of have been a utilitarian for a while but not hadn't thought at all about what that actually meant for my life until college and you know i sort of got there and you know kind of like ",
        "20": "quickly became like okay fine yeah there are implications that this has like if you're actually thinking about what you can do for the world um that's that's going to have implications for how you should live your life and um you know got sort of involved with the ea community there and you ended up uh you know deciding to to go into earnings but just you know figure out how i can make as much as i can donate as much as i can which you know led me to uh to wall street and then eventually uh you know where i am today were you you were one of the top donors to the biden campaign how much of your income do you give away do you foresee a percentage every year or how does that work so eventually basically all of it this was a much easier question to ask to answer when i was at jane street sort of like you know had like you know salary and bonuses each year and sort of like the answer is a bit over half that i was giving away i'm planning to give the rest away uh later storing some up for sort of like um you know exceptional ",
        "21": "opportunities it's harder to define right now so it's sort of like basically all of the like you know money that i take out of the uh of any of the companies is just to donate um but most of the money that i'm sort of quote unquote making is staying in in the businesses because they're still scaling up a lot and you'd be silly to be like fundraising and simultaneously taking out money so just one last question because we got a wrap up but would you say you're religious or adhere to a certain brand of philosophy uh so i'm uh i'm utilitarian um and what that means basically is in the end i want to uh do whatever will serve maximize ultimate aggregate you know happiness and well-being um and and that sort of sounds a little bit total logical but i think it does have real implications i think one of them is you know you look at most of the people who who will exist are not yet born um in expectation and so i think absolutely absolutely crucial is thinking about what things can we do today that might impact what the whole ",
