        "1": "most what more has he talked about at the conference yeah akiko just a little background on sam bakeman freed uh you know two i think pieces of his origin story we'll say has been one that he uh sort of had his experience in traditional finance as an arbitrager um and uh sort of the the famous way he made his money in cryptocurrency was you know back when the markets were a little bit less institutionally driven uh he found that the price difference on a cryptocurrency exchange in korea and uh another one in the u.s was so that he could just buy buy bitcoin on one exchange and sell it at another and he made millions of dollars in the span of something like you know several weeks uh doing just that trade so that's sort of like you know a crypto story the other one is effective altruism which we've touched on you know he's he's fully committed to giving giving millions and now billions of dollars uh ",

        "4": "sort of stand around this passion of of thinking that if you are passionate in something um you can essentially do whatever you want i think that's sort of a part of the millennial and jinzy ethos as well and that's that's sort of sam kind of embodies that from here on out so it's this whole effective altruism thing is something that's not really talked about in the markets but it's a big part of uh sam and ftx and it's been on display a lot during the conference david i'm not convinced you're doing a lot of work in the bahamas are you going to get to stay there through the weekend no i'm actually uh flying out this afternoon but i'm sure i'll find time i was actually speaking with i won't say which company is from but i was trying to you know uh set up an interview with somebody today um and we're talking later today i wanted to talk earlier in the morning he said something along the lines of uh yeah i'm gonna be at the water park around that time so i'm not sure if i can catch the interview so we'll have to go later so that was interesting plenty of people having fun here it's the bahamas i wouldn't hate on that um david thanks ",
