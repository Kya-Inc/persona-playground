        "0": "hello hello hello everyone we have our keynote speaker mr sam bankman freed um he is the ceo and founder of ftx and today he is going to be talking of course about fdx and it was founded uh he founded before finding uh our media and then ftx sam was a trader on jane street capitals international etf desk he traded a variety of ets futures currencies and equities and combined their automated otc trading system he graduated from mit with a degree in physics over to you sam thank you i and thanks everyone for having me um it's a pleasure to be here um so i you know i'm gonna i'm gonna talk some ",
        "1": "about uh about sarah and solana about defy in general where it is where it it's been where i think it's going um y'all should also just feel free to hang with questions in the sidebar thing here at 60 chance i'll figure out how to read them and if so you know towards them um over the course of this um so uh anyway and and you know again thanks thanks so much for having me um i when you think about you know where d5 is going um and you know there's obviously a lot of different parameters there um and part of the hope is that it becomes something that's really big um and that it becomes something that's a lot bigger than it is today and you know there's some metrics by which it's big today you know there's tens of billions of dollars of value uh flowing through the d5 ecosystem um but there's only tens of thousands to ",
        "2": "hundreds of thousands of users um which is not nothing but it's less than the number of users of even you know the larger uh centralized crypto exchanges today and so this isn't a mass market phenomenon yet this is mostly something which is internal to the crypto ecosystem um but it awfully you know obviously plays a really big role in the narrative around crypto um and around what crypto could become and so you know what gets us um you know from here to there so to speak um and i you know i i think that there's there's a number of things that need to happen a big one of these is solving scaling um and this is this is not an easy thing to solve um the the core of it is that right now you know um on uh on ethereum you can get about 10 total transactions per second going through the network and if you look at like how many do you ",
        "3": "need for d5 well i don't know it depends on what defy is and you know becomes but just to start off with right like what if you want to put one giant company on a blockchain you know take your your favorite you know really really big company right um you know something that a billion people might use um you know whether you're looking at something from finance or social networks or uh or something else you know you're sort of gonna see something kind of like a million transactions per second right if you'll get tweets per second facebook likes likes per second trades per second um those are the sort of numbers that be as few as 50 000 for for some of the less intensive programs maybe as much as 20 million for some of the more intensive programs and you can sort of go through this process yourself but you know i think that that's about where it tends to end up for like a gigantic company and like that gives you a hint as to how big uh blockchains would need to get in ",
        "4": "terms of capacity and throughput um in order to really start to touch what they could be in their potential and you know it means you have to be talking kind of millions of transactions per second probably um just a lot um and it's not just that it's bigger than 10 which is where where we are today um it's bigger than a thousand um and and i say a thousand because that's where alts are um in fact that's where a lot of fast you know blockchains are and and and i think what you run into actually is that like a lot of scaling solutions for crypto just don't scale enough they're enough to scale so that today's ecosystem could comfortably use cryptocurrencies but they're not enough to scale such that tomorrow's good um at least not in the cases we're all looking forward to so anyway that's just i think a really really important backdrop to think about when you think about scalability is anything that says 5000 transactions per ",
        "5": "second it's a big improvement but it's actually not enough of all um and so what can you do you can either have a single something you call a layer one layer two block chain roll up side chain whatever you want that's a million transactions a second or you can kind of patched together a hundred of them each of which have ten thousand transactions per second and that's sort of what you know things like sharding are like where you take sort of like independent chains each of which is a few thousand transactions a second and then and then sort of weave them together um and it's a really cool idea the problem with it um is like you can imagine what happens if you put took twitter and you sort of sharded it between like a hundred different shards right like bob would tweet something and you know to to jim say hey jim do ",
        "6": "you see my tweet and just like nah i didn't see your tweet i was like why not fault jim says you know i'm on twitter number 71 that's where my account is i was like oh yeah sorry no i'm i'm on 53. so you guess you can't see my tweets like that's what happens if you have sort of like you know each shard uh representing like one percent of the universe and maybe on like an hour-long time frame you could have interactivity between them uh but we don't have this is sort of real time interactivity and and you sort of get variants of this in a lot of cases where you know i think sharding can be super powerful but you sort of need to at least be able to get like at the very least kind of want each program to not have to be split between shards right like like like single programs should be on single shards and ideally even like you know ecosystems or like you know sectors and so again i think you kind of want to get like a million tps per shard sort of um and just very very few ",
        "7": "blockchains are even trying to get there i think there's a decent chance that a lot of this type hasn't been built yet um and you know i don't think that blockchain tech is a solved problem um i you know i will say that you know i've sort of been involved in the the serum in solana ecosystems and and what is that well salon it's a blockchain and the thing that sets it apart is that it really is shooting for that much gps for you know millions eventually it's you know probably the fastest today at 50 000. um but what really makes it different isn't the speed today but it's the roadmap that is like you know really really actively um shooting for way more than that um and so many blockchains they sort of like have their current speed or roadmap to get to a few thousand and that sort of that um uh and much roadmap to get beyond that um yeah i see someone asking how about how about eth2 um as far as i understand now of course ",
        "8": "these two it could become anything right and and and so i don't want to try and box it in but if you look at what you two i think is currently understood to be um with sort of the current iterations of it uh or drops of it you know you're generally looking at something which is like you know 5 000 transactions per second per shard and then a lot of shards um and so you could use sale to large total network throughput in some senses but it's going to have trouble fitting any single large applications on it and and and composability doesn't work very well at least not not sort of like real time composability um between shards and so so when you look at a sector that you want to have interacting products in once again you sort of like have this issue where 5000 tps is not enough to have a sort of like interacting composable ecosystem long-term um um so i you know i i think that like ",
        "9": "the way that i i think about this and sort of to to to sort of like respond to to you know some other things that i see people will serve asking here is um it's not to say that charting is bad because i do think that at some point like there are real advantages to it but that you sort of first want to get as much as you can on one single like natively composable shard like on one track that is just totally real time um interacting and then once you have that then you might want to duplicate that you know in parallel lines um with with like slightly more awkward composability between them um but i i i don't think you want to sort of phone it in too quickly like i think you want to build out as much as you can on each thread before you start duplicating the threads um because you do lose a lot when you start duplicating um uh so that that's sort of like my ",
        "10": "thought this i should mention like other people disagree with me on this so uh you know to take this with a grain of salt um you know this is this is just some of my my thoughts um i but i do think it's like really really important for the ecosystem to be thinking about this because this is what's gonna you know really determine a lot of the future of d5 and you know it's one of the hardest parts of it to get right it's one of the parts that you you need to put lots and lots of work and testing into to get right and and you can't just sort of like at the end be like oh yeah it's jacking up 100x like no it's gonna take years of design and so i i do think that's sort of a fundamental thing that you want to be thinking about now and and when you look at dap design um you know the sort of like way that you're designing these is gonna depend somewhat on uh you know the technology it's being built on it's not that hard to translate ",
        "11": "um but it's not not trivial and and so again um you know when you think about something like the evm um you know which is you know the ethereum virtual machine um it is the most common by far way uh to be building decentralized applications right now it's also not built for mass scalability in a single chart um and and that's why you don't generally see evm compatibility being prioritized as much for something like solana it would be very useful in some senses but anything that was built using it the risk is that it ends up not being able to take advantage of the faster throughput of solana because it's being built in a way that isn't um isn't sort of natively paralyzable um and uh and that is maybe just to get to like what is what is sort of the big philosophical distinction between say eastern and solana eth2 takes a bunch of ",
        "12": "basically totally independent charts and then sort of layers on top of ways for them to you know on long time scale server interact with each other solana takes parallel transactions that are each block syncing up with each other um and you can think of it as doing sort of what like memory stores do where you can have like 100 people simultaneously trying to submit transactions the blockchains just all go through they all are syncing up with each other layering on top of each other and if two people are both trying to affect the same memory cell um then whoever got there first sort of you'll block out other people for a second or two um until that sort of like propagates through um but if two people are sending you know actions that that don't overlap in terms of what memory cells they're they're supposed to be affecting then they can basically happen in parallel and it doesn't actually matter which sort of goes first or second um uh and that that that sort of is the the ",
        "13": "the way that's on views parallelization um again i started bringing up i think it's a super cool tech but i don't want to say that it definitely will be salon that things are built on in the future because who knows right i think it's cool but like maybe there's gonna be new technology that's built right what matters in the end is that good tech is built and you know is able to uh uh you know to really move the space forward um i that's you know i think that's sort of the biggest thing that's going to determine what what programs moving can build and a big part of this is we should be holding ourselves to a really high standard with d5 programs um and i think this is the other thing that i tend to have like a somewhat different take on that i think a lot of people in d5 i think that diva is extremely high upside and could be really cool and really powerful and has really new advantages i also think that in order for it to be ",
        "14": "able to access those advantages um i it's gonna have to i have to be a really great user experience people are gonna have to love using d5 applications and if they don't you're not going to get that many people switching over from non-decentralized to decentralized applications they have to be able to win on their own merits not relying on the fact that they're decentralized in order for the masses to be willing to use them now if you can get there i think people will be excited about the decentralization for them but i think step one is you can't turn them off with the user experience and right now i think most d5 products do just because it's a new field it's hard to build in d5 you're doing it right behind your back because if you screw anything up uh you sort of like barely maybe can't ",
        "15": "even patch it right so i can meet will code on the blockchain sometimes and and so it's not easy you know the entire sector hasn't been around that long and it's competing with like very well built applications um and a lot of these teams aren't um yeah aren't that structured um which is part of the nature of it but i do think that building really really awesome products is at important pieces and i don't just mean awesome theories i mean like enormous thought going into the gooeys i mean thinking hard about where each button is placed right like we i know at ftx like we get customers like yelling at us constantly if we put a button on the wrong part of the page so it's annoying and there's too much mouse rolling involved in clicking it um that's a sort of level that this is true of like most you know large centralized exchanges um and people and defy goods have to think ",
        "16": "the same way you know they have to think of themselves as um really uh being you know being held to building an unbelievably you know well-tuned experience um i you know responding some other things people brought up what are sort of like are there trade-offs here is just like ones better than the other or like how would different chains like are there costs lying yeah so first of all and sort of like lines up with some other people have said um it's not built on the ethereum virtual machine it's not built in solidity and you know that means that current blockchain developers need to adapt to a new environment and it means you can't copy paste apps over from ethereum that's that's a barrier to entry um the other thing though is you're just stressing the system more if you're trying to build something that is very high throughput ",
        "17": "that puts stress on everything as for if it's decentralized or not right like ftx when we built ftx um there's a lot of stress on a lot of pieces of that system it takes a lot of work to have that never fall over right when things get busy people are trying to send hundreds of thousands of orders per second on ftx um uh and we need to have a hundred percent off time i you know it's just like like i'll sort of give one egg don't i think i probably before in some places um but we once had a couple minutes of effective downtime on ftx because the following reason um is like chinese new year and um as part of that we uploaded a um some banner to the website i did a picture on it had some text um turned out is a very high resolution picture of a dragon like very high resolution and we didn't we we weren't very careful about putting that very very sharp ",
        "18": "dragon um sufficiently uh behind uh various firewalls um and uh immediately someone caught this and started just requesting uh to download this dragon image like hundreds of times thousands of times a second and took down the ftx gui from it and um you know that sort of like one of many pieces of the system and that's that's a pretty extreme example but it's just like everything gets stressed in ways you don't even realize it well when you try and scale something um and so when when when you sort of look at like uh you know at what um i with with with you know building a really scale highly scaling blockchain well all of the nodes have to do a lot more there's processing way more messages right you need to have like a ",
        "19": "more robust node infrastructure um it needs to be running more powerful machines they're not incredibly expensive and cost hundreds of dollars though um i you know you can't um i you know you sort of like have to be running like you know pretty well-tuned software to do it you don't have massive margins for error in it um if also under massive spikes in volume from you know the high baseline to an even higher level you have to worry about whether the nodes will even be able to keep up with that and produce blocks in time um and then you look at all the other infrastructure how about rpc servers like you know servers whose entire job are basically to serve apis um to dapps to be able to keep up with all the requests and all the data and they need to be able to store all the data um as you see like all these things that stress the system and it's doable but it just it it's harder ",
        "20": "um to keep up with um uh and and so i do think that's sort of like you know something to keep in mind whenever you try and scale d5 um is that like everything gets harder in ways you forget um i i think that's an important thing um i one thing which which i actually want to touch briefly on um i think is probably top of mind for some people is there's been a lot of talk about the um uh infrastructure bill uh this is a proposed bill um in in the united states around uh taxation of crypto and there's there's been some thought that it might touch on on defy some and as the the what's going on there basically good thing and complicated area of line the states but also globally um which is i there are lots of ",
        "21": "businesses that have various legal obligations one example is that some businesses have an obligation to report their transactions to the irs um for tax purposes um so that the irs you know knows who owes tax on them uh think what you will about that that's sort of how how the world is in general and now you take an autonomous smart contract on a blockchain right and you're like go mr smart contract please file the 1099s smart contract says nothing because it's a smart contract not a person and it can't understand english um and um uh and it sort of creates this really interesting tension um that sort of underlying a lot of the regulatory questions around defy um i and and it starts to ask these these complicated questions about ",
        "22": "who does have regulatory duties in this system and what does that mean what are the analogs um and uh and so anyway there's sort of you know have been various drafts of a bill floating around about who has the duty to report transactions uh for tax reasons the irs and you know some versions have referenced e5 but i sense they're exactly what that means it's not it's not clear who the right parties would be in d5 for it and some worries have been that this would accidentally hit even mining firms which is not the uh not the intention uh anyway i know that i am uh starting to uh you know starting to to come up to you know uh to time here um and i i don't want to to keep you guys uh too long i you know hopefully this was uh at least a little bit interesting and useful um uh for people so you know thanks so much for having me "
