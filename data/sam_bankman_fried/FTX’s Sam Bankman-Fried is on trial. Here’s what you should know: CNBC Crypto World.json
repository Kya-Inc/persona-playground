        "3": "as former colleagues Caroline Ellison the head of alam research and Gary Wong co-founder of FTX pleaded guilty to federal charges and began cooperating with prosecutors in January though SPF pleaded not guilty to charges against him I started using FTX over a couple years ago I started by deposing a few hundred th000 at the first time and over time I depos about $12 million on Exchange uh when it went down I still had about over a couple million dollars mostly in ftt and salana that was also Stak for 14 plus days so couldn't withraw it I don't think myself or anyone else anticipated how quickly the downfall would have happened and how drastic it would be the trial date was set October 3rd and in the meantime SPF was allowed to stay with his parents in California so long as he stuck to the terms of his bail but he just kept talking blog post trying to explain the collapse of FTX messages and interviews with reporters and DMS on social media eventually landed him in Hop water in ",
        "4": "March the court revised his bail conditions to restrict him to a flip phone and basic laptop cracking down on his Communications that didn't seem to stop him though in August SPF landed in court again after prosecutors accused him of leaking Caroline Ellison's diary entries to the New York Times the judge agreed revoked his bail and sent him to a Brooklyn jail until his trial you know with the trial coming up you know it's it's sad and it's disappointing on a personal level I mean thinking about all not just the hard work that we tried to do on the FTX us side all the colleagues all the customers that were affected but mostly the fact that even a a year later this is still going on but now that the trial is kicking off what's the case prosecutors are making exactly s SPF is facing seven charges including money laundering and fraud prosecutors claim that for about 3 years SPF and his colleagues ran a massive conspiracy first we charged up from 2019 until earlier this year bankman freed and his Co conspirator stole billions of dollars ",
        "5": "from FTX customers he used that money for his personal benefit including to make personal Investments and to cover expenses and debts of his hedge fund Alam research specifically this indictment alleges that SPF misappropriated and embezzled FTX customer deposits and used the billions of dollars to fund speculative Venture Investments and to quote help fund over $100 million in campaign contributions to Democrats and Republicans to seek to influence cryptocurrency regulation among other things he has also been accused of conspiring with others to make false fraudulent statements and representations to ftxs investors and alam's lenders including by providing false financial information Caroline Ellison and Gary Wong two of his former colleagues also faced fraud charges last year and both pleaded guilty they're cooperating with prosecutors in their case against SPF more recently in September executive Ryan Salem pleaded guilty specifically to campaign Finance and money transmitting crimes he claims ",
        "6": "those contributions were made at the behest of bankman freed SPF faces up to 115 years in jail we reached out to his lawyers ahead of the trial but didn't hear back publicly he of course denies the allegations made by prosecutors at last year's dealbook summit though he said he was responsible for the failures at the company I'm deeply sorry about what happened there absolutely were management failures huge management failures I bear responsibility for that there were oversight faur transparency failures reporting like so many things we should have had in place I think that a lot of it was on the risk management side I was surprised that he he spoke at the the summit at all as a lawyer my advice to any client that found himself in a situation like he was in would not to be would be to not speak there is no defense for him anymore that he did nothing wrong um the defense is uh whether he did something intentionally and fraudulent ly wrong or ",
