        "4": "galaxy digital john the stage is yours all right thank you gabby and bruce for leading us into here so today we have myself we have nazia my colleague here at galaxy and we have sam the co-founder and cto the ceo of uh ftx so we want to make this feel more a little bit more like a conversation we thought that a great way to start off given the nature of this event is to uh talk about how our personal journeys here uh kind of chart the course of crypto evolving from what you'd maybe call more of a hobbyist thing that people dabbled with until becoming a much more institutional marketplace and for this conversation we have probably the best person to talk about it none other than sam sam could you tell us a little bit about what it's been like for you from you know the moment you left jane street and got involved in the crypto to today running ",
        "5": "the powerhouse of a firm that you run in ftx yeah so i i left you guys a quad trader of jane three creating international etfs and uh left in in late 2017 and maybe i'll first talk about what's the same between now and late 2017 although very different than most of time in between um which is the amount of excitement about crypto in the world it's hard to remember all the way back in 2017 at least for me maybe other people remember that far but it's been a few decades for me since then so um and uh like today um i mean she's like you turn on cnbc and you're like yeah 50 chance they're talking about crypto which is a lot of percents um crypto is i mean say it's up a lot and it's it's what like less than a percent of global market cap of stuff and it's 50 of cnbc um and it's i mean i don't know if your two uncles are talking about ",
        "6": "something financial at the dinner table for thanksgiving it's probably crypto that's like a pretty good guess you know so like back then there's unbelievable amounts of excitement and interest just off the charts um in crypto uh and uh in between now and then no one gave a i mean i'm exaggerating obviously but like the dole drums of 2018 2019 right like late 2018 and most of 2019 really like i would say down by a factor of like 10 in terms of the amount of coverage that crypto was getting so what are the differences between now and back in late 2017 um league 2017 brought a lot of resemblance i think to like spring 2020 in that you started to hear murmurings of like people are getting more excited about crypto and you started to hear institutional murmurings you know you had one or two jumping in and like if you talk to a lot of investment banks you'd be like yeah you know we're having many meetings again on crypto we're talking about we're seeing ",
        "7": "friend do something we'll see i don't know you know um and it's been you know a year and a half i guess since then and in that last year and a half something has happened that did not happen last time which is all the institutions decided yes they are going to get involved and why didn't it happen last time i think it's timing i think they're kind of on pat's that in like january 2018 then february came things crashed they crashed before the panels voted yes and so the panels voted no you know and and we didn't end up getting that institutional interest um until the you know giant ball run of 2020 and 2021 um but this has been sustained for a year and a half instead of three months and that's been long enough for every financial institution i've talked to um in the last six months to have decided i've talked to all the major ones basically um to have decided affirmatively that they are going to do something in crypto not today who knows what not them but it'll be something and that's just an enormous difference ",
        "8": "like every bank is excited to talk to us now to be clear they're not like yes we will bank you for customer deposits they're not that excited to talk to us right they're excited to talk about talking to us about those things so you know and and you can feel everyone has a very strong sense of which way things are going and we see frankly very little disagreement on that like very very few financial institutions that we talk to think crypto is gonna go away or be fat now almost everyone sort of freezes us like yes however we know we have to get there yeah absolutely sam i would agree with that it's i joined galaxy december of last year uh to head up credit risk and just in the past now it's been 11 months just such a huge difference in the amount of counterparties that are onboarding their nature like how institutional they are there's constant interest and i think that's the thing i think now it's not just this topic to talk about it's ",
        "9": "people are here to stay and they know that crypto is here to stay it's not going it's it's been dramatically different just in these past 10 months so comparing to three years ago yeah it must be very very different yeah i mean sam's point about right the excitement was there people were looking around back then but now what is certainly palpable is that at minimum everyone wants to talk about talking about getting into crypto and so i think obviously sam's seen it you've seen it we've seen it um you see it across every facet of the industry where there's just a rush to find a way to get involved that whereas uh back then you may have had you know a single champion at some organizations there are multiple champions at every organization and that's the thing that got this over the line and of course certainly helped this has been a sustained call it 18-month uh period of excitement versus again back then we had kind of a quarter ",
        "10": "maybe a six months of things going well leading into a subsequent crash kind of starting january 8th of uh 2018 a dark period for all of us who are involved at the time but it definitely feels like there's been a maturation right in this maturation uh with it what it's brought is as these institutions transition from just like okay interest to now holding the committees to now generally they're talking openly about their next steps and speaking to companies in the space and finding ways to get involved to maybe slightly more mundane talking about talking about and now they're presenting with the companies that they're speaking with now they're going through the process of how do we get involved what can we do does this meet our standards and you know both of you are in uh in places and certainly myself as a venture investor here we really run into and see where they are sometimes good matches and sometimes there's still kind of a ",
        "11": "chasm to cross say can you tell us a little bit about you know in your experience what are they asking for that actually is reasonable and now those are standards that are going to be met but sometimes i'm sure you must see cases where they're asking for things where probably just don't fit um this world anymore they might be asking for things that are actually in this case totally moved and we could we could talk about that too yeah so you know let's start with the reasonable things um they do due diligence on us like they do diligence on any of the companies to start with so whatever you know kyc the ultimate beneficial owners um blah blah blah um then what do they do they do a deep dive on our clients policy and by compliance i particularly mean aml kyc policy and they do a much deeper dive than they do on any other company and you know we get a lot more scrutiny than a payment processor does which isn't obviously correct to me like payment processors are also involved in ",
        "12": "a lot of money transmitting and in fact the thing that we do the most of that money transmitters don't do is not particularly relevant for money transmitting it's the trading um but uh there's an extremely high standard that sort of crypto companies are held to um on diligence around the uh kyc portion um and when i say hi it's worth noting no one knows what the exactly what they're looking for here you know like no one's like oh they don't have this piece of their policy because no one knows what pieces it's supposed to have it's sort of a holistic thing and everyone's feeling it out um so so that that's like a big thing if i bring going through that policy people ask a lot about our licensure right um and you know we've put a very large effort into that last year we're now licensed in seven or so different countries we have a number of us licenses and we have a number more likely coming before the end of the year um uh and uh okay so that's sort of like a step ",
        "13": "two maybe and some of these can vary into the unreasonable but many of them are pretty reasonable like many of these are like a reasonable enhanced diligence to do on sort of an emerging sector um occasionally we get just crazy requests right occasionally just like please like you know give us a set of documents that could be used to go public and get a bank charter at the same time in order for us to like subscribe to your api feed not use it just like get the market data and be like what you care about or custody you're just reading market data um so um okay so this is sort of sort of that but those that's not the norm really the norm and like the reason that this takes forever to a lot of these onboardings is two things one of them is custody um no one knows what the answer is in custody no one knows what the right answer is because fundamentally crypto does something different than traditional finance does by default and i don't know what you do about that ",
        "14": "you know in traditional finance you put all your money with one prime broker and then they connect to each exchange on your pack crypto is disintermediated you go straight to the exchange but there's no place you can put your money such that it's accessible on two exchanges at once so it's a complete complete reverse um and people like well what if we just put out a custodian it's like yeah you could play like sodium but that doesn't what's the custodian going to do it's like custodian think you see exchange separately and like put your money there do you feel that much better because you sent it in a blockchain hall on the way there like you know it's sort of like it's it's introducing other stuff and maybe it helps but but i i think you have to think about why and so okay so that's one of the big pain points just understanding what even is the right custody framework for institution here um the other and probably the biggest sticking point is vague compliance concerns and these aren't identifiable compliance concerns those are you can identify them and then you can ",
        "15": "address them these are like we have to get our compliance department comfortable with the flow is it kind of phrasal here and that's that's language for like it'll be a year and a half right and like there's nothing you can do about it right like they they need to get comfortable if they're like great what can we do to help like we'll tell you if we find something you can do to help but they don't really have anything basically it goes their comments are like oh jesus really you want to do this like yeah we're gonna get such a big fine come on come on don't don't do this i feel like no this is really important for business obviously you really want us to figure out how to deal with crypto and the business seems like yes absolutely they're like all right well it's we'll talk about it we'll we'll we'll discuss internally and maybe cut sync up again you know in in a month or so and then you say coming up and going like all right through you guys can do it once like well we talked about it and we definitely are concerned we want to we don't we want to we just we just do we need to make sure that we do it the right way yeah and the ",
        "16": "right way we get that all the time i laugh because i've been on both sides of these conversations a thousand times in the past four years uh and of course in some cases this is totally reasonable because in some cases they're like look i'm sketched out by this like this company doesn't seem right to me um and and i get that but i think in other cases like i like actually there's nothing that seems that wrong to me just like this is a scary word and there's a lot i don't know and like like i'm kind of like i have a duty to protect my company and i'm like worried about this it's new what if i screwed up you know and it's also kind of i understand it um but but it means that these progress real slowly yeah i think what's so interesting about this space right i'm still relatively new traditional i was in traditional finance for around 15 years before coming but what i find so interesting that i think scares a lot of institutions is the amount of leverage offered in crypto and so leverage in general in finance is considered this really scary thing that you should be very sophisticated to use and etc crypto because of that exact ",
        "17": "decentralization really allows anyone to use as much leverage as they want when you go into some of these crypto exchanges and then also in the d5 world there's a limit and they've come down but i think for traditional world people and for the institutional world that concept of a lot of leverage offered to everybody is a little scary and i think as i've gotten so much more comfortable in this space is the traditional world is very used to these very long margin periods of risk like let's say your counterparty defaults now you have to wait a certain amount of time to close them out and liquidate the position the thing that is amazing about crypto is it trades 24 7. so there's no concept of like oh there's an issue on friday night now we're going to wait till monday it's immediate and what these exchanges do which is a huge huge thing on the risk management side is that if you're following below a certain level because the markets are moving against you you can be liquidated immediately and so that concept is something that i think for more and more institutional players ",
        "18": "to feel comfortable in the space they're gonna have to grasp and really understand how those models have been derived right because it's not like you're waiting for a person because you have to deliver a notice and that takes a while it's like the quickness of crypto is this huge thing that makes it scary for institutions because markets can move so quickly but it's also this huge risk mitigate which i think is just super interesting yeah i mean a minute to understand it absolutely does and i think a lot of people go through that process like real-time liquidations that's scary that's so much scary and we're like no no it's the opposite this means that you don't have to sit there unable to liquidate watching a position go underwater this is good for the risk model right yeah and like and and i think to address another thing you said the disintermediated nature of crypto is interesting it means that there's easy access to a large variety of users that you that's like a big pain in other things that being said there's one thing i want to sort of like push back on a little bit which is this notion that like ",
        "19": "futures and margin are unique to crypto um people talk about how like there's more volume in leveraged futures in crypto than in spot that is for every financial asset class there is you can't find one that has less volume and features in spot in fact crypto's ratio is i think a little bit less than many asset classes are between futures and spot like this is not a crypto specific thing this is just for everywhere um it makes sense futures are the economic the efficiency to trade if neither party cares about delivery and so that's where most of the volume goes up and you know certificate traders are always accessing leverage and retail traders sometimes are and this is actually true across asset classes as well crypto isn't that unique in these regards um and i i don't want to say there's like no differences here but but i think that the differences have been a little bit overstated um and obviously crypto is more volatile right and so like you know there there are some some real differences here but um i i you know i think that like ",
        "20": "um people will sort of frame this as some weird scary crypto specific phenomenon and if this is just how finance is everywhere and we saw it i mean at jane street i saw similar things going on everywhere right people looking for trades that they thought had high upside um and high upside usually means high downside as well and that's where a lot of the flow was a lot of the volume was the thing you don't have in crypto that you do have in traditional finance is a massive massive size institutional um flows into standard products um and so on top of all the sort of like more uh bespoke trading in traditional finance you just have like the pension funds being like this month we are putting 500 billion dollars into german stocks that's what we're doing and it's like by an enormous amount of german stocks just like all of them ",
        "21": "index weighted you know and be like oh boy has a lot of buying and it would be like pretty pretty bland standard products but like massive massive massive institutional inflows or outflows coming from them and that is not really hearing the same way in crypto yet yeah and i think the difference also is with that traditional world is there's this concept of leverage or credit is extended based on credit worthiness right so it's not that the customer just chooses okay this is how much leverage i want to use and so i think that's probably a slight that that whether it's right or wrong but that's what institutions probably feel a little bit more comfortable with that there's some assessment being done before leverage or credit is offered yeah of course there's the flip side of it right which is that you you do this on a traditional asset and you lose money and they come billing you saying you've got to wire more money in or we're going to sue you and in crypto the the whatever you put on the platform generally that's all you can ever lose they won't come after you ",
        "22": "and so if you only put a thousand dollars in they can't go after money in your bank account which is a nice risk mitigation technique absolutely and although we could actually end up seeing you know more credit being extended away you know with the collateral being off the platform i think i'm sure i don't know if you guys have experimented with it but i imagine as we kind of see the industry maturing more uh growth from other areas stagnate a little bit i'm sure there'll be some exchanges out there and maybe not even exchanges maybe other platforms who are looking to extend credit because we're not right uh if someone thinks they can make a business out of it i'm sure someone will try it's all over the place in crypto now if i was saying one of the ques one of the areas i was trying to lead you into with that question earlier was yeah the point about custody seems to be at least from my experience where we run into the most confusion uh when it comes to crypto because there's this fundament like again traditionally ",
        "23": "you're used to oh well we have a custodian the assets are with the custodian they're never with the wherever where i do my execution those things are very well separated and there's this forgetting that we actually you know in a way blockchains are kind of like their settlement and custody machines what they do it's kind of kind of built into it that process has at least in our experience there's been a lot of education involved with it and even still sometimes people six months eight months after their first foray into crypto still clearly appear to be a little bit unsure about it what's it been like for you guys dealing with you know really big players um for getting into do they get uh stuck on custody is that kind of a sticking point at all absolutely like they absolutely do and it's an interesting topic because you know like look we need to use a custodian like tell me more and like you know it has to be a custodian we're like all right what you made a custodian like you know party custody the funds i'm like ",
        "24": "yeah that you can conjugate it i agree but like describe such a party and they're like well they they're good at custodying probably funds and have connectivity to order books and like do you mean like a wallet on an exchange like no no like again i'm like all right what if that wallet on the exchange was tied to an entity it was a qualified custodian like qualified considering like yeah it's a trust license like oh it's a qualified custodian huh like yeah they're like uh i don't know is that what i meant not really what i meant like all right we'll look like it's like yeah i know sort of like a i don't know like a we have custodians right in the space like you mean like all if i guess it's like well no i mean like and so i think sounds like this interesting conversation where like teasing out exactly what people mean by it is super interesting and i think no one actually knows and all the custodians are going through this too right you have anchorage if i guess bitco is with you guys now right and yeah um you have uh ",
        "25": "uh you know coinbase has their in-house custodian so there's three different flavors of custodian and like the real answer is i think like people like the idea of it being a custodian but they haven't yet decided which part of it they like and what it would take to get them that part and like how that applies to like you know well it's like okay it's galaxy custodian now because aquarium like yeah you know yeah right it's it's an interesting question right and and so i think that like when you try and mechanically break it down to what what what are people looking for here i think some people it's just a legal thing like they're like look i can oh i'm only legally allowed to start my friends with the custodian and probably i think a qualified custodian is probably about as close as you can get to what that means um for some people i think it needs they want to be a different entity than the more matching engine in order it's going to be like okay what if there's a common owner like nah probably not you know um uh and i think ",
        "26": "for some people it's someone who's good at safeguarding and then other people like well it's gonna be an insured one really right let me walk you through the history of custody insurance and tell you exactly how much it's paid out ever for any of this right and and and like like a little bit but like it sounds like you know we'll forget ftic insurance like you're trying to put 10 million dollars in fdic insurance would give you a hundred thousand optimistically covered like that's that's not that's not gonna help right like that's not what you're not worried about losing the last one percent of your assets right that's not so i i think it's really interesting like don't know how it's gonna end you know i i think that it's going to be a fractured mess and then you know institutions like big banks you're going to be like we can custody and everyone's going to try and sign up with them but it's going to be a horrible experience they're going to stop now they're like oh god i don't know what to do now and so i i think it's like legitimately don't know how this ends and i think some people are just going straight to exchange some people are using third-party custodians some people are trying to use like uh you know fidelity or ",
        "27": "um uh bony melon and and and it's gonna be messy assets flying all over the place lots of bespoke agreements none of which line up with each other and i you know 30 years from now it'll gel a little bit more maybe yeah i think you know your point on specifically just it's not clear that people know exactly what they're looking for is the most interesting one it's because this concept of a custodian a traditional market's so well ossified you don't stop to investigate what do they actually do why am i actually using them right well part of it is the law then second there's you know at least an 80-year history of like this is kind of how it's done in in you know western capital markets so i guess we're gonna keep on doing it people they know they need one they don't know exactly why or exactly what four and as we transition into this new area where white like the acid by itself is always custodied in some wallet whoever owns the wall is effectively the custodian then you have okay well it's a qual if the exchange has a ",
        "28": "license and you know it's a trust and the qualified custodian is that account it'll take a little bit more time i think maybe maybe if we'll see you know uh specific regulations that pertain only to crypto assets and not to broader securities maybe then now if the laws update maybe someone will be able to say oh okay now i know um maybe that leads me into uh again for for both of you from your seats how do you see um new new regulations coming um have you thought about this idea of you know do you have any opinion on should there be maybe a crypto specific regulator i'll tell you i'm super biased i certainly hope there will be a crypto specific regulator versus trying to jam these rules into you know the paper frameworks of the paper securities world uh so what do you think sam so rather than talking about the regulator i'll talk about the regulation i think that you could absolutely do this within the existing regulators ",
        "29": "right like you look at the sec which has lots of experience with markets and with issuances and with consumer protection those are the cftc which has lots of experience with markets and with clearing houses and risk modeling and consumer production and and like they cover a lot of the ground here right um but putting that aside looking at the actual regulation it's there's a lot of things left to to be improved um one example um what is the current regulation for spot cryptocurrency order books like which which regulator oversees that what are the rules around it there basically is not um there is the money transmitter framework for deposits and withdrawals there's a cftc for futures there's the sec for securities a spot bitcoin usd order book is sort of homeless right now um so so okay that's got to be figured out one big worry of ours is that we'll somehow end up with a system where a bitcoin future and a security token or maybe security token ",
        "30": "spa market will be in completely different frameworks under completely different regulators with no ability to collateralize to margin to have a central clearing for them and it'll be completely shitty user experience switching between them right so i'd really like to have a unified or unify a bull framework at least in which lots of different crypto asset markets and custody and clearing um and collateral could live in one universe maybe it's a joint universe by you know the two markets regulators maybe they sort of divvy it up or something but but come up with frameworks that plug into each other nicely so i think that that's sort of a big thing um i obviously uh something's gonna have to happen on uh how the world is currently treating tokens that might be securities like lots of people are loggerheads right now and um i really hope the seat is better in two years than it is today i think that's going to take everyone coming together i think it's going to take like ",
        "31": "the sec token issuers and the exchanges sitting down a table be like all right let's figure out what the framework should be here um let's figure out is this a registered exchange if so what registration is it let's figure out what needs to happen for the issuance of tokens let's face and like hashing out something that has the properties which are necessary to give regulatory comfort um and i that's something which i'm hoping will happen um it's probably going to be a medium to long-term task to get there um and then stable points they come up a lot i frankly think this is the easiest one of these to handle because i think there's a straightforward regime that gets 75 percent of the way there with very little lateral damage which is you say if you're a stable coin and you want to get u.s liquidity you have to give daily attestations of exactly what is backing your stable coin it needs to be not junk bonds it needs to be reasonable crap and you maybe need to over ",
        "32": "collateralize like maybe your hair cutting if it's not just dollars in bank account maybe you have a half percent haircut and treasury is a five percent haircut on corporate paper i don't know i'm making that up right and then you have you know a semi-annual audit to confirm that your assets are exactly what they say they are and like right there we've that regime addresses the biggest worries in the stable coin space which is what if you get a trillion dollar stable coin with a billion dollars of assets backing it right like that is the huge elephant in the room and just not that hard to have oversight of that and it doesn't get in the way of that much of things it's just like and so i just feel like that's the right place to start is to get in place a framework that would be reasonable and that would address the biggest concerns um and you can there's always gonna be more details to hash out later you probably need to have a black list for financial crimes related addresses most major stable coins already have this you have a centralized process for this you could have like an api that ",
        "33": "like you know treasury produces and all regulation points must consume which publishes a list of blacklisted addresses each day i don't know you know you know stuff that some extent is already in place exactly and this is sort of analysis and jiren labs and places are already sort of doing this right and it's like so it's just not that hard to put these pieces together to address the major concerns while still leaving stable points in place where they can revolutionize payments and instead i i'm worried that we'll just have a lot of yelling about them back and forth and a lot of bad proposals and a lot of talking past each other and a lot of worry and i get the worry but i just feel like we can address it and we should do that yeah absolutely agree i would touch on two of the things you specifically said transparency it's key and just in everything when you're going into a new space transparency is something that gets everybody comfortable so transparency is such a key point and two my hope's really that that we not try and fit a square peg in a circle hole ",
