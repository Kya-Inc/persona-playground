        "0": "all right guys thanks so much yeah this was the headline this morning our friends at wonderfy listing on ftx to provide 24 7 global access uh to trading tokenized securities or tokenized shares uh one of the topics we're going to cover if you're wondering about ftx or cryptocurrency exchange uh they made headlines going back to 220 or 2020 i should say with 150 million dollar uh acquisition of block folio more recently a monster 19-year 135 million dollar naming rights deal with the miami heat founder and ceo of ftx sam bakeman freed with us this afternoon to talk about this headline a little bit and a few other things sam so good to have you thank you so much for doing this we appreciate your time uh this afternoon for those who might be a little bit you know confused here and wondering exactly what it is we're talking about when we hear you know a company like wonderful listing on ftx ",
        "1": "talk us through some of the differences maybe in a tokenized security versus a typical equity totally so you know there are a few different forms but you know in this case in wonderful is itself a traditional equity which is trading on an equities exchange um in addition to that we have listed a tokenized version of it um so it's a token that can be effectively redeemed for the underlying security and created with it so it's a way to transfer equities onto the blockchain and allow them to trade on cryptocurrency exchanges and when it comes to you know if somebody's maybe not not familiar over overly maybe uh comfortable with this type of idea what do we need to know as investors here you know when it comes to some of the mechanics are there differences what what do people need to know to really get behind this idea of training a company like a wonderful through this method yeah i mean absolutely do your research ",
        "2": "and you know there are different versions of tokenized securities and they actually do fairly different things um the ones that we list on ftx are backed by underlying securities they are guaranteed to be worth that um and you can be creating redeemed in a brokerage account for the underlying and so it gives you a different outlet to trade them but ultimately you know it should be fairly closely tied to that underlying asset there are other types of tokenized securities that are what are called algorithmic um and what that means is that rather than having any redemption for the underlying security there's some on-chain protocol that attempts to pay out what the underlying securities are worth um these can be risky in some cases you should do a lot of research before accessing them uh because in in some cases they may be bounded in how much uh they can pay out it might be that if the security goes up too much ",
        "3": "the contract is out of funds to pay out and stops to track the underlying security so you know you should understand the particular version that you're accessing uh before doing so so one of the uh a strategic partnership obviously between ftx and wonderful what does this mean overall uh for this space for the d5 space you know seeing a company like wonderfuy listing on uh ftx you know what would you say going forward for companies such as a wonderful what does this mean for listings overall yeah i mean you know right now we're in the early innings of this um right now we are starting to see for the first time a little bit of crossover between traditional equities exchanges and cryptocurrency exchanges but i anticipate that will speed up going forward and and so where where i think we may get to um is a place where you know the actual venue that one is accessing a product from uh it might be a fintech app it might be a cryptocurrency exchange um you know ",
        "4": "already it's the case that everyone is going through an intermediary before accessing you know the new york stock exchange or at least all retail traders are because that is how that is set up there is no you know mobile app one can use to trade on uh you know directly on it um and i would not be surprised because of that um to see that sort of speed up over time where more and more people are using cryptocurrency exchanges or products to access traditional securities you know through tokenized versions and it allows them to have among other things a common interface between their cryptocurrency and equity investing hey sam great talk so far and and thank you so much for coming on we're really super excited man uh and congratulations on all your success i'd love to have you back on i'm gonna put you on the spot i'm sure you'd come back on next time we call you right of course good perfect um i wanted to ask you about cardano but i don't know if you're going to give an opinion on the future of some of these projects i ",
        "5": "know they're they're working with this is charles hoskinson i know you probably know all about this uh token there but i'll ask about cardano after i wanted to ask a question that's very very popular amongst our viewers and we had this discussion yesterday and i said that i'm not educated enough to talk about it i'm going to assume you are there's a lot of people are nervous right now with keeping their tokens on exchange right they're very very nervous about security we always hear i mean it hasn't been thank god too frequent lately but where are you with security of holding on exchange versus cold storage do we recommend that we hold a certain part of our portfolio in a cold storage wallet or you know where are we with all of this right now totally and you know it depends on the details here obviously tokens that you want to be using on a blockchain directly um you're going to want to consider holding in a self-custodial wallet because that is the way that you can you know write smart contracts um you know directly uh to the blockchain ",
        "6": "when you think about uh holding tokens on crypto exchanges you know obviously there's been uh there are a lot of assets held that way there have been security breaches on some exchanges in the past and you know every exchange will tell you the same things right about having top tier security i think the thing that i think about the most here is what's the reputation of the exchange what are the reviews like um but then you know is it regulated um you know are is there someone overseeing that um and then the other thing is how much do they really have backing those assets right both in terms of you know literally how much do they have but also how large is the business um you know how much capacity does it have to be able to weather any storms and i think that the larger and more central venue that you're talking about you know you often see places that have um a lot of implicit value that is that is backing their operations especially if ",
        "7": "they have a track record of protecting customers funds i think when you look at smaller platforms you know some of them are top-notch but it can be a little bit harder to investigate and and you know there's less certainty that there is something ultimately that will absorb any losses if there are any okay yeah so i think that that puts to rest a little bit of this i mean we know coinbase obviously going public so they have quite a big market cap there and i just don't know about the responsibility right like if you have you know even if you have 50 000 or something there in btc or whatever um you know they don't really owe you anything if they get hacked and i don't know the legalities of that but i think you bring up some great points you know the bigger boys are going to have better security measures so uh thanks for bringing that up did you have uh any opinion on cardano or anything here or um any of the different altcoins anything you guys that ftx or anywhere is looking at uh for maybe your next little bump up yeah i mean you know i don't want to give investment advice here you know i'll say that you know during the bull runs recently we've seen massive massive ",
        "8": "inflows and price appreciation of uh a lot of altcoins that far out what we've seen with bitcoin you know conversely uh during market corrections like what we've seen over the last week um you know some all points have lost a fair bit and so i think you should generally expect higher volatility with them you know you should generally only put funds that you're prepared to lose into them because they might go down substantially um but you know i they may go up substantially as well you know i think that when i look at these coins outside of just sort of the the general volatility the thing that i'm thinking about the most here is what is the underlying technology here and how excited and bullish am i for that is there a real specific need in the world that this is solving where i feel like yeah this might become a really important project and protocol over the next five years and i think for some tokens you know i see that um for others it may well be there you know even if i don't see it myself um you know obviously i've talked a lot about solana you know over the last year i ",
        "9": "think it's one of the protocols which has the potential capacity to scale so the type of transaction throughput that would be necessary to have sort of mass adoption of blockchain i think there are some other blockchains as well which are you know looking to get into scaling game you know avalanche is one which is done well recently um but you know obviously that's not a uh you know guaranteed future price movement and you know maybe these things are already priced in maybe something else becomes important so you know i definitely don't want to be giving investment advice here my man absolutely great answer and i i truly love that one last question this is not investment advice at all but i thought it's been pretty cool man the nft space something that's sort of come from blockchain we know matic is involved in that as well um nft is super super popular amongst our viewers uh any opinions here i mean we've talked about this with kevin o'leary he's talked about putting some watch valuations uh through nfts and different things like that there's so many fun things even companies like playboy uh various companies out there sports companies ",
        "10": "we've seen top shots as well are you into the nft game what do you think about nfts these days yeah i mean ftx has launched an nft platform which we're really excited about um you know i i think what we're seeing right now are really the early days when people are first exploring nfts when they don't yet have a lot of their utility a lot of them are literally just jpegs i think what we're going to see over time is more and more integrations between nfts and protocols more and more you know cases where there's a video game or a concert or something else that integrates with nfts that represent in-game items or attributes or tickets or something like that and my guess is that's where the next big big uh growth and fps is going to come from sandbag been freed thank you so much for taking the time to talk to a guy like me i'm going to throw you back to bread and thanks again thank you amazing interesting uh you know time to be involved in this space in general as we head into the end ",
        "11": "of the year here sam give us a look into 2022 what are you excited about heading into the new year you know i i think the thing that i'm able to get moved right now is the development of the regulatory landscaping crypto i'm optimistic we're going to see a lot of advancements there over the next year a lot of clarity and um hopefully exciting new products obviously this is something that's going to have to come in concert you know with both regulators and industry um but but i'm optimistic that there will be a lot of progress over the next year um that will bring more consumer protection and simultaneously more clarity and certainty to the actors in this space so i i think that's the thing that i've been looking at at the most uh anyone looking for uh more information on ftx where's the best place to go uh ftx.com is the easiest place ftx.us if you're in the united states you can find me on twitter at spf underscore fpx founder and ceo of ftx sam bakeman freed we appreciate your time thanks for doing ",
