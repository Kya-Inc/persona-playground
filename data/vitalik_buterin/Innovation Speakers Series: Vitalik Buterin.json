        "1": "at all before 2009 yourself so I'll start off by going over God then I will go into even more detail what a theory is and in more detail what kind of things we need to unlock me so start off with a simple question what is he watching now there is a lot of very simple answer for this ape watching isn't even watched you watch the beautiful destruction upon the blah blah blah but I'll tear for even a more functional definition with youngins no this is the definition that does not say anything about what if I would watch him looks like hell watching his designs what outwards Armour sequences where security this definition just says what watching does and it's a simple one-sentence definition I'm watching it's a decentralized network everyone got that so far so there's two parts to that definition ",
        "2": "you might notice this decentralized network as represented by a bunch of computers that linking to each other and memory on the right as representing my brain so first of all decentralized networks have existed for a long time even the internet itself can be viewed as being kind of a centralized network even things as email to meet you as being partially decentralized networks and we've also had fully or centralized networks so for example or allows sharing who's using his bits for instance gobble it any better files biting people Skype I mean right now expect us how the concept of a super dope which are basically all controlled by Microsoft but in its original vision of what is much more sort of your network it's more similar nonetheless an internet connections and you know there's a bunch of other key centralized messaging networks there is a centralized networks for lots of reasons ",
        "3": "at the bottom that word mean point for a sec centralized DNS system and if you miss an enormous deviation so will we have lots of these kinds of projects around to an end there's also many things Mastodon twister variants blockchains like point - with wonderment whatever so you know this is an area of head of computer science that against very very rapidly developing especially over roughly the last decade or so basically just as computer hardware and computer software technologies but as finally not be good enough to the point where we can support systems like this now there's one important insight about these two categories of applications the second category so things things bubbling online it's not like it's not ",
        "4": "like the first so think is bullet online or not like and you might ask what the answer is what the supreme stands for memory so what's like mean but what I say things below the lines not about memory and things above the like to happen let someone look at meta file sharing networks let's say I T some perfectly legal file resource panics distribution and I send it to you over a  all over Fitzwater I have what is the result I have the file that was just a man I see in you and possibly a few and about a dozen other some years ago now after that cloud transfer is complete the network itself does not remember anything you know about that contract but network itself does not remember ",
        "5": "anything about it whether or not that flower transfer took place right furthermore if I take this 1x distribution and I send it to you then extends the exact same Linux distribution with someone else this is consider this right now what's with any kind of decentralized messaging network is the same thing let's say I write out of that station I say hello I am metallic I am sending you a message and I send this to one person going hit copy paste and then send the same message to another person this is also totally funny after I sent both messages the network does not really remember that his best days were set my computer remembers and their first recipients computer remembers the seconds but no one else remembers and in reality if all three of our computers forgot everything would still be ugly so the networks that are a bulldog line are different right so let's look at ",
        "6": "just a Bitcoin to currency is any table let's suppose that I have one of the two big ones and I create a transaction that sends these 100 big ones that are one person then I create another transaction that sends the exact same 100 their points through another words now either of these transactions is totally valid light itself but both of them cannot succeed at the same time right now why well if either of these Disick's it at the same time then I need my concerning why would you been going through the 200 parents now maybe this could be a good revenue stream for the Singapore government but if this actually we'll be doing fairly quickly become workers so the young if you want a currency system to work then basically you want it to be impossible to convert and this is one way in which money is fundamentally different from other kinds of information a transaction of one ",
        "7": "bunch of their points for me to you does not just have to do with being able it also has to do with every other person in the community that's using that particular currency who might in the future be receiving those opportunities they need to know that you have the points after I set the transaction it needs to know that I know one of the points now know we are well the system has to remember that right now I have 100 points one that sends my first friends and after that happens I now have zero points and it's deeply try to send the second transaction then the second transaction fails and it fails because the system remembers that and that now I have zero main point so DNS suspects well let's say they I will just need to you know an existing centralized DMS is an example let's say I register off-site I register a theory on tumblr then four years later ",
        "8": "you come along and you see who thus etherium project is very popular well I have absolutely no more more morality whatsoever and so I am going to try to register in your hands I'll work myself and I'm going to view business website the scam people so basically you would try registering etherium network and then you want to come up your own web page that says look I am selling ether just put your credit card numbers here and you were trying to take people's life so look if this were to happen right there would be two attempts of registering if your hands up work one of which happened something around something like in November 20th of 2013 the second one happened October 9th 2017 and if you try to achieve between these two in a system that had no memory then you were there because after October 7th 2017 you would just see these two attempts to register with us the same website and you have no idea at which inverse so if ",
        "9": "you wants to have a system that favors the one that came first then he needs the house has come with the memory so memory so the earth detect will use case of memory this is kind of the simplest use case of memory to explain is basically if in some application he needs to know who did it first so who received a point first if I said they're going to be and I said the same coin to see which of those transactions came first who registered a domain first if I register a theorem that work then it's you registering areumdawo words to try the scam people well was it either register at first or isn't even registered firstly entering into a financial contract so there might be pieces where the only one other person can enter into some contract or in matters when you entered some contract or matters except itself to us accepted or reverses up of through an offer let's say I need can offer to trade one else at another ",
        "10": "aspect she was sending transaction accepting the number I changed my mind that I said the transaction against what we offer which one of them is two against accepted first so these are all just simple examples of their use cases of memory so in order to have decentralized networks of memory we have to use somewhat different technology from the technology that we use to maintain that networks without memory now we have to use a lot of the same technology we still need computers we still need public key cryptography we still need a way for these computers to talk to each other and to though we still need networks where infant computer sends a message this message could get broadcasted to the network but we also need this other ingredient which is how does the network remember stuff and in cases of course what comes to network to come into agreement on whatever event occurs so what suppose I sends two transactions one of them said too much much meaner person view I said these ",
        "11": "three transactions at the same time this is so this is not me trying to teach Radha era to drive me this is just me trying to get music Network we've been out making some of the one half things that he has the coins and the other half thinks of people well the network passed through and suddenly come to an agreement on whether words what were the other no it could be a random choice but the network has to choose one or a passage choose the item be a consensus more importance than choosing you know which it would the one that came first if the line came versus only one second ahead of the one with the exact so what's a look at money's definitely systems very similar so this is the salon where I show you the part where I'm watching is actually a chain applause notice how it's not actually important for describing but what I'm watching guys it's only important for describing why watching so we have course and each block is like a package of transactions and you have nodes in ",
        "12": "the network and some of these nodes in the network may be included in theory on skis these are both monitors create walks every blog has a parent so everyone points to something it says this previous blog is the one that before and this is the watch that I am creating on top of that creepers board so normally you are just how disorderly conduct progress where one node creates a block then at some point you have some new transactions and other nutrients have walked on top of that water let me get some more transactions you wait a bit then another Noah greets a block on top of that block and so on its network and the network is progress is basically and anything music walks one after the other and everything works but what if it doesn't work out so there is always the possibility that either because of an attack or just because of regular Network latency you have a branch ring so what do you guys mean when you have a ",
        "13": "branch well the simplest way a bridge could arise yes basically if let's say you have this one one so you have this block over scared then let's say some computer with Network Creed's this block on top of the waterfall before this block can get broadcast it to the entire network some other somewhere else in the network still thinks that this this block is the head of the chamber and so that really creates this water now you have two heads this unrest and so we have too much you to get between now what's gonna happen well basically all of the other nodes in the network are going to are going to see the two events and they're just going to randomly decide do you want to read a book on this one we're doing a blog on this one let's say we get the theory of one and let's say we have a node read some walk on top of this one and at the exact same time another new principle or contact us on top well okay we wait a bit more then ",
        "14": "eventually some though it is going to create up one and that one is going to be on top of one of these two chains so what's the atomic exchange now this chain is finally longer than this chain and so this chain is considered the canonical chain and so everyone creates all except off this one in this chain gets forgotten so this is what this does something that just couldn't happen in a in a rank normal situation even if all of the participants in the network innocent so in general even creating this decentralized consensus between nodes were all of the nodes orful are just totally innocent nodes that are at fault all mostly following the protocol it's still hard if you have even the smallest amount of network latency now the other possibility of course is that there is an attack going on so what if two nodes or attackers and they would say that or but let's even ",
        "15": "say that I don't do Syria have a chain and let's say I a lot of custody right so you think you work just I tend to make a better example let's say I bought a bunch of cool I bought a bunch you give me the bolt I send you and say 500 big ones for the wool I take a one-way ticket to $1 where I design stuff just disappear retire with this goal you know and we are nobody can find me now what I'm going to do is I'm also what you try to get my big ones back so here's how I will try to get my big ones back I am going to create another transaction which seeks those 500 bitcoins and everyone's to myself so it's a transaction just like the transaction ii through the 500 points but this time it's entered into this transaction to me now in the original chan you're still way that this transaction is ever going ",
        "16": "to get in because the conflicting transaction that's in through the platform to paper or anybody so what am i going to well i am going to get a bunch of families and these animal again what you know is to start creating to start creating a box on top here so we'll say the original transaction was imported here I invited mr. creepy and a bunch of notes to started reading that chain over here it included why transaction over here and as I am going to try to get the network to accept this chain and it's this chain wins then I have your goal and I have the 500 big ones and I can enjoy my vacation but now this is supposed to be part right it's supposed to be hard to do you brought someone with a bunch of bitcoins so what are we gonna do here well it turns out that basically create if you try to create ",
        "17": "your own chain then in order for your chain to get accepted over the chain supported by the rest of the network you have to in some sense have more economic resources and the rest of the chain but the rest of the network put together right so improves on work each one of these locks requires a large amount of computational power and if you have more puppies if you have less computational power than the rest of the network to mine then though this this chain is just going to keep growing and it's going to grow faster than your channel and if your attack is gonna fail the only way that your attack succeeds is if you have more computing power than the rest of the network put together now what our pork is talking to the linkage that this algorithm there's also something off your state that we'll talk about later but you know in general right d10 that the principle is that in order to break the system you have to have a very very large portion of the ",
        "18": "economic resources in the entire network now you might notice that this planet security model is a very different security model from the security model that existed in a decentralized messaging network it's not about what company of how much economic resources it's not about how much computer how are your habits just I said the message to you i encrypts the message with your policy and I also know digitally signed the message with Michaels my private to you you know that because of the digital signature you know that the message came from me and because of the encryption I know that only you can see the message so with this in that you did in decentralized networks without memory the only thing that we rely on for security is cryptography here cryptography is thought about and the reason why cryptography is not enough is because there is no purely cryptographic they to ",
        "19": "say when the skull message was created or when some message was broadcasted right so there is no hero if you have a disagreement between two mysteries there were still your only cryptographic way of determining which actually represents the real and so we have to rely on other tools so what schools done to watch hands belong so this is the event of package of security technologies that I referred to I spoke Tomica dollars right so cryptography is used in watchings and cryptography is used to remind guarantees about Pass so cryptography guarantees transaction validity so McGarrett so you have digital signatures on every transaction that guarantee that the transaction actually was approved by the center and you have a various hash linking which preserves integrity of history so which pervasively meets the block ",
        "20": "makes the historical watching kind of immutable in the sense that you can't just like the way they look swamp one transaction known for another and still get the rest of the network to examine economics their minds guarantees about the watching its future so what do we mean about the watch in the future but we need this let's say I buy your gold and I send you five hundred bitcoins and these five hundred big wins get introduced here I want the guarantee that the transaction that gives through the flat country or if you want the clearance given the transaction that gives you the black bunch of pink ones will actually continue to be included in the chain and then it's not just way to refer isn't your endeavor word this guarantee cannot be provided by a third by the quarter and the reason isn't it depends not only on the past behavior of the nodes but also on the future behavior of those now how can we guarantee a few June the notes well we can give them economic incentives we can trust basically that they are not you know boy I'm actually going to fall incentives and that ",
        "21": "they're not going to voluntarily preach about somebody on trying to get the transactional verdict and we have D centralisation and decentralisation basically ads fault tolerance and security if one node goes in the network goes down well there's still a bunch of other nodes in the network that are producing blocks if a few nodes in the network can hacked in those donuts to start creating blocks that are automated well we still have even more nodes in the rest of the networks that will continue what they want so because of these three things together basically watching InStyle networks or cetera now notice that once again this is a different security model from the security that we had another vendor systems so this isn't kind of I replied infinite security that says that you know it takes the drawing a trillion years to work to separate this as subscript ography now it's still dusty a truly enjoy in years to bring the cryptography system but the economic incentives are different the economic ",
