        "10": "he also thinks a lot about public goods radical markets wealth distribution he runs a very active twitter account where he good naturally engages with all kinds of people who are constantly trying to get into fights with him which is kind of what people do on twitter and yeah and we're very lucky to have him i would say that for me along with nick sabo and who we interviewed here in 2017 uh who created bit gold and coined the term smart contracts and along with zuko who is the irrepressible founder of zcash i've always found vitalik nick and and zuko to be sort of the the three people on twitter that i early on learn a lot about crypto from so welcome vitalik and thanks for taking the time to talk to us about yourself and ethereum well thank you very much for the introduction of it's good to be here yeah so i'm gonna start just right off the bat we're probably gonna try and keep this fairly basic and high level for those of you who are quite experienced with cryptocurrencies this may be a very general conversation but at the same time i'm going to ask vitalik some ",
        "11": "hard questions we're not going to let him get away with it's just the pr angle and so but we'll start with some basics we let's assume we know what cryptocurrencies are and for those of you who are not that familiar with it i would suggest you go back to the podcast that tim and i did with nick sabo back in 2017 i believe that's titled the quiet master of cryptocurrency correct uh so once you're kind of up to speed on that this one will make a lot more sense but we're going to get right into not what is crypto or what is bitcoin we're going to get into what is ethereum so how do you describe it today vitalik uh sure so the one sentence explanation of ethereum that i sometimes give is it's a general purpose blockchain so this of course makes more sense if you kind of already know what a blockchain is right it's this kind of decentralized network of many different computers that are together like maintaining this kind of like a ledger or this kind of database together different participants have like very ",
        "12": "particular ways of plugging into that and they can send transactions that do very particular things but no one can tamper with the system in a way that's outside of the rules and ethereum expands on the bitcoin approach of basically saying well instead of having rules that are designed around supporting one application we're going to make something more general purpose where people can just build their own applications and the rules for whatever applications they build can be kind of executed and implemented on the ethereum platform so one explanation that i heard one person gave us that like bitcoin is like a yes spreadsheet where everyone only controls their own five squares of the spreadsheet but ethereum is a spreadsheet with macros right so you know everyone kind of controls you know their own accounts which is kind of their own little piece of this universe but then these pieces of the universe can have code and they can like interact with each other according to pre-programmed rules and you can build a ",
        "13": "lot of things on top of that right like bitcoin builds a monetary system on top kind of famously ethereum can build you know decentralized domain name systems again various decentralized financial contractions some you know prediction markets you know non-functional tokens and all sorts of different schemes that people have been coming up with and the limit for what you build is basically your own creativity but like the core difference between building an application on ethereum versus building it on you know some traditional centralized platform is this core idea that once you build your application in the application does not needs to depend on you or any other single person for its continued existence and the application is guaranteed to continue running according to the rules that were specified and like you do not have any ability to kind of irregularly go in and tamper with it that's a great overview and i like that excel analogy of it's a spreadsheet with ",
        "14": "macros instead of just a spreadsheet where you control your own cells i'll also try and articulate in a few ways that i understand it kind of around the edges because i think ethereum is one of those things that's now quite a bit bigger than you and it probably has evolved in ways that even you didn't fully anticipate so in some sense we're discovering ethereum and no longer just building it i also like to think of it as kind of an unstoppable application platform so a platform for building unstoppable applications kind of like a world computer where let's say that we want to run very very important computer programs where we don't trust the computer itself and we don't trust the other people to execute code in our behalf then we create a single world computer where we check the code on the machines of many many different people all around the world who are properly incentivized to maintain a single computing state so if bitcoin is a shared ledger then ethereum is a shared computer for the entire world to run its most important applications so some of the applications that people are building on it are among the possibly the most ",
        "15": "important applications of the future so let's talk a little bit about those applications about what this trustless world computer is doing what are the applications today that are the most common and that you're most excited about so first of all i mean i think uh if the asset is a cryptocurrency and it itself is an application and of the first application of ethereum going beyond financial things a bit i mentioned ens the ethereum name system so yeah that's you can think of it as a decentralized name system right so like for example you know when you go to ethereum.org there's dns domain name system which is this big that kind of table that maintains this mapping of well you know if a person enters ethereum.com the server they actually have to talk to to talk to the website is you know like some particular id address and this dns system that maintains this kind of public relationship is a fairly centralized system with a ",
        "16": "very small number of servers running it so ens is a fully decentralized alternative that is running on the ethereum blockchain and you can use it not just for websites right like you can use it just for accounts so for example like there is a messaging service called status it's like you know in terms of like what it feels like to hear that you know it's a messenger it's similar to telegram we're signal or whatsapp or any of those um but the difference is that it is decentralized so there is no dependence on any single server or like there's no dependence on status to company which is nice because it makes the whole thing much more censorship resistance it makes the whole thing just a much more guaranteed to survive you know regardless of what forces wish for for its existence or wish against its existence in the future ens is this really important part of it because well if you have a chat application i need to have some name by which i can refer to you know the users that i want to talk to right like i want to type in and say ",
        "17": "i want to talk to nevada and things like telegram and signal and whatsapp that mapping is generally basically kind of authenticated and controlled by a server but whereas in the status it's all just done by the ethereum blockchain right so that is one good example i think of a a kind of not financial but still very important um ethereum application now going beyond those two cases there's a lot of kind of more complicated things um so there's the d5 decentralized finance space which is this big category that has all sorts of interesting contraptions in it um like so for example there's some prediction markets so fly forbes where you can go and like bet on different outcomes like you know who's going to win some sports game or you know who's going to win some particular election there have been very successful prediction markets running on the ethereum blockchain there's uh just markets for ",
        "18": "trading between different kinds of assets there's what's called synthetic assets um so if you want to have access to like some mainstream real world asset like you know what's older could be one example but you know you don't have to like dollars like there's uh lots of other examples as well there's versions of this that are kind of purely virtual sort of simulated versions that exist um purely you know within the ethereum environment now there's this entire kind of very powerful financial toolkit that exists within the ethereum ecosystem on the whole like there's just a lot of these uh interesting things that happen i mean there's even games that are based on um ethereum there's a whole bunch of different things yeah in fact at d5 decentralized finance is this gigantic new category in which entire companies and protocols are being built in a decentralized way that allow you to do a lot of things that would have required wall street along with bankers and judges and lawyers and accountants to handle but now is done through smart contracts ",
        "19": "that are living in the blockchain on the ethereum blockchain and these smart contracts are kind of at the core of the ethereum blockchain we talked about these in the next sabo podcast but he famously described it as like an automated vending machine as an example of a smart contract where you you put in money in a certain slot and there's a certain set of rules and you press certain buttons and you get certain products in exchange but these smart contracts obviously now are getting far far more complicated can actually be used not just to compose financial applications but even applications that we don't normally think of as financial one way to think about it for those of you who are into computer programming is imagine if every piece of a program every function had an address from which anyone in the world could reach it a unique identifier address and it had a slot into which you could insert money so you could call any function wherever it is in the world you could insert money into it and it would do something on your behalf and so that gives ethereum applications this very interesting property called ",
        "20": "composability where you can use them almost like lego blocks each one builds on the rest and so the final product in d5 ends up very very advanced in the traditional world when let's say like robin hood builds their application and then schwab builds another application wisdom tree builds a mutual fund or an etf those can't combine with each other but in the ethereum world of defy all of these apps by default are open source permissionless programmable and can connect right into each other they can be identified called and paid for in a permissionless trustless kind of way so the the infrastructure that gets built in defy and ethereum although it's it's very difficult to build and it's complex once a piece is built it is available to everybody and sort of stacks on to each other almost to create one of those japanese style voltron robots that just gains in power yeah naval let me jump in here just as a proxy i'm not even a proxy i am a listener ",
        "21": "literally in this case and i'm happy to be the listener so i'm both a proxy and an actual listener but how does one think about intellectual property if all of these otherwise separate or previously separate applications and so on are now lego pieces that are kind of natively interconnected is that a silly question i'm just wondering if no no it's a really good question i mean my high level view on it is that what blockchains do is through consensus they protect the data so the users own their own private data and then sort of the public data that's needed to make the blockchain work its integrity is protected by the blockchain and that's what blockchains do they get a whole bunch of people to cooperate on what the canonical output should be but the code itself is completely open it is kind of backwards to what we're used to we're used to closed source companies capturing value but here all the values created by open source but yeah vitalik i'm sure has a different view on this but you know there's there's lots of copycats and clones and there's attacks and forks and so on ",
        "22": "and it's kind of a wild west out there but generally uh so far it does seem like the original products and the best products are succeeding the best and they're sort of always in the scoreboard of market cap and transactions and usage but uh yeah it's it's a wild west out there yeah and i think um the blockchain environment is definitely a one that operates under somewhat different rules than the traditional environments right like just one example of this is like the idea of forking right uh so one story that happened around the beginning of last year that i just love to tell because of how it kind of combines together the values of the space so nicely as uh there was this platform called steam and in the steam uh there's steam the platform and then there's steam the company right and like steam was its own blockchain and steamed the company like they did have some steam tokens um but like they didn't have the right to like just do whatever they want with this theme the platform because it was a ",
        "23": "decentralized thing but you know they had some tokens and then steam the platform had a voting mechanism and holders of esteemed tokens could vote on changes but then the steam the company got bought out by justin sun you know the infamous tron person and uh justin's son like basically nick started doing some things to kind of increase his control over the uh steam platform the community was kind of very unhappy with him and then he even like kind of took advantage of you know some of the voting mechanisms and some coins held in exchanges to sort of seize control of uh at least the formal rules of the platform even further but then what happened was that the users were built right what the users um said is well we're creating a new platform called hive and hive is just a fork of steam it is gonna have a start with the same or mostly the same rules as steam and we're even going to copy over most of the balances of the steam tokens except if you participated in the attack then you know your balance goes to zero when ",
        "24": "you fork and most of the users like basically that have collectively moved over to this new fork and you know justin's son had this full control of an empire but then uh you know nobody cared about that empire anymore because everyone now cared about hive right so like forking is this primitive that exists and because of it you know you do have this ability for just communities to you know exert kind of collective agency and um like basically protect themselves from kind of being exploited um but at the same time if you as a here project team are good to your community then like those same effects work in your favor right uh so those effects work in your favor because community is willing to support your project if someone makes a copycat then you know generally very few people are willing to kind of support and provide any assistance to that copycat project unless of course you do something to betray the community's trust in which case you know that like those ",
        "25": "kinds of situations and the situations that the copycat is for i think legitimate developers have plenty of ability to build projects to gain from those projects becoming successful and there's a lot of ways in which the crypto space does end up kind of assuring that but you know at the same time it's also not in environments where anyone's level of control was infinite and in some ways that's the other beautiful thing about the space vitalik had this great line in his blog where he said we wanted digital nations but we got digital nationalism um and there's a lot of truth in that but basically these are these are like digital nations and one of the analogies that i use for defy is that these are like crypto castles made of bath that are freely trading with each other just imagine like people are building applications on top of ethereum they're protected by mathematics those are the walls in those castles and there are moats which are rivers of cryptography but then they have free trade policy ",
        "26": "with each other so that creates a lot of innovation but if one of them starts misbehaving then it's people can leave and go to the next crypto castle or this is where the analogy breaks down they can actually replicate it just create a copy and move to that one like in the steam and hive example well that also is i mean it has comparables outside of the world of blockchain and cryptography in so much as if we look at say wordpress as an open source project you have companies like automatic and matt mullenweg you might people may notice that m-a-t-t in the middle of automatic yes which layers then these for-profit services on top of an open source platform and technically someone could create a competitor but like you said there are these questions of viability value-add and moral leadership and so on right so so there are sort of certain elements that contribute to the ethereum ecosystem so to speak that you can ",
        "27": "perhaps compare to other things to help educate people as well i was just sort of connecting some of the stuff that's a good analogy with with uh wordpress the the place where the analogies diverge is that wordpress it's kind of a single-player game like each person owns their own blog right in the ethereum world you could use ethereum to build a twitter that everybody owns and it requires social consensus to operate but multiple people can put their data in so it's this really weird thing where it's decentralized it's open source but it's still used to coordinate and bring people together blockchains combine this really weird combo of individualism and individual control and the ability to leave along with consensus and community and cooperation and build this giant public good so it is its own thing it's hard to figure out but it's worth figuring out because this is the next phase of the internet after mobile yeah let me if i could jump in just to kind of be the kid in the corner of the class in the back of the class asking questions i would love to hear from you ",
        "28": "vitalik what was the initial vision for ethereum and what has most surprised you if anything you know i was doing a bit of reading just on the the genesis story and first of all i i mean maybe separately maybe for another conversation it seems like a lot was done right in the beginning and i was reading a quote from a wired piece in 2016 and it's and this please feel free to fact check if it's not accurate but it says you know when i came up with ethereum my first thought was okay this thing is too good to be true and i'm going to have five professional cryptographers raining down on me and telling me how stupid i am for not seeing a bunch of very obvious flaws but you know dot dot two weeks later i was extremely surprised that none of this happened as it turned out the core ethereum idea was good fundamentally completely sound i'd love to hear what the core idea was maybe we've already stated it and it's redundant but the initial vision and if anything has been really surprising to you that has transpired since those early ",
        "29": "days so i think the core idea is um you know to make a general purpose blockchain um and to kind of open the gates for people to build what they want to build on top of it right like the background kind of story for when ethereum was starting to be formed was that this was just the time when the idea of a blockchain kind of beyond bitcoin was just starting to gain legitimacy and people were just starting to realize that you know there are these applications for blockchains other than just them running a currency i mean it would be nice to ability platform that can actually support them and so at the beginning right you had single purpose blockchains you had bitcoin uh for currency you had namecoin for domain names you would have like single purpose protocols like covered coins for issuing assets the second step is what i call the swiss army knife protocols so a swiss army knife protocol basically says well here's a list of you know 25 different applications that we've ",
        "30": "identified as being important and let's be able to watch it to support all of them uh so like mastercoin was one example of what i call the swiss army knife protocol and the problem with the swiss army knife protocols is that two weeks later you know some 14 year old teenager in finland comes up with a 26 application you have to go hard for the protocol so the next the natural step is this kind of general purpose approach where instead of your blockchain supporting 25 applications your blockchain supports a programming language and whatever a system with whatever rules he wants to build you write that in a piece of code and the nodes in the network can all execute the code and the network kind of helps to collaboratively enforce the rules of this code for the um objects that are in your particular application so that was kind of the technical uh perspective and then there was also the perspective of well you know what did i envision people building on top of it it's actually surprising how it hasn't changed that much i'm like i remember some of the very ",
        "31": "earliest applications included kind of financial gadgets so contracts for difference were one example which is uh you know one very particular subset of the thing that today we call d5 decentralized file storage uh like you know paid people to store a gigabyte of your data um was one thing i was excited about um decentralized name systems was um excited about those you know decentralized training between different assets like a lot of the examples of just things that people wanted to do with blockchains at the time like they just are the same as what people are doing today though there are also new applications right so like non-fungible tokens um that i briefly mentioned nfts the idea here is basically just create a yet token that you know represents something other than a financial asset and one example of this could be that an nft can represent video game assets and nft could represent like a digital work of art ",
        "32": "where he wants to sell kind of like basically breaking rights as being the original owner of it and you know there's a lot of these different use cases and these uh right now the nftm ecosystem has been extremely successful um about a week ago there was a yeah a neon cat nft that got sold for the equivalent of about 580 000 dollars and so that's an example of a new thing another example of an old thing is that daos decentralized autonomous organizations and so the idea here is well you know let's build an organization where the rules for the decision making in that organization you know the equivalent of like shareholder or board voting or whatever he wants to use could just be written as rules in a smart contract and then the program that executes those rules can be directly in control of whatever assets the organization is supposed to control and you know we've seen a couple of examples of kind of simple daos in action and make or dial which kind of maintains um ",
        "33": "you know die the stable coin that you know algorithmically targets a price of one dollar is uh one example i mean now there's also rye uh you know there's a lot of examples of this a lot of things that we expected from the beginning um prediction markets um also have been part of you know what we were excited about using blockchains for since 2014 and they're still around today so a lot of old things and also some new things as well thank you extremely helpful yeah i mean yeah some of the ones that vitalik just laid out like i think your recent guest katie han mentioned nfts as nifties is what she called it uh no i did because i wanted to try to oh you didn't sorry i wanted to try to force that into the lexicon but you got it okay well you watched this stuff yeah nifties yeah so nifty nifties are this crazy idea that like owning a digital copy of something and having your name stamped to it somehow gives it more value but it seems to work it works with collectible trading cards it seems to work with digital art and then because of the composability of the ethereum infrastructure you can reuse these ",

        "94": "about me and it was signed with your key and you can make these proofs but where the proof does not reveal the contents of the thing that it's proving right so like for example i can prove that i have an account that has at least 100 coins but i don't have to prove which account it is i don't have to prove exactly how many coins i have and there's a lot of this very fancy mathematical magic that basically creates this protocol where if you give me a proof then i know that the statement is true because if the statement is false you would have had no way to generate the proof but if i have just the proof i can learn nothing else beyond the fact that that particular statement is correct so this is incredibly powerful cryptography it's uh it's behind zcash for example there's also with your end applications like tornado cache um that are using it there's zero knowledge proofs also have these really nice scalability proofs um so the proofs are very quick to verify even if the statement that they're proving is incredibly complex ",
