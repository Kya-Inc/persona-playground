        "0": "foreign [Music] first of all you know what is ethereum 2.0 right so some of you might have seen the news that a nimbus um a team that's part of the status project just released a test Network for ethereum 2.0 so you know what exactly is this right so the ethereum project um one was started at the beginning of 2014 it launched in 2015 and since then it's had some changes and so there was the homestead um hard for Crime there was the the spurious Dragon upgrade the Byzantium and Constantinople upgrades and there is going to be the Istanbul upgrade soon enough but instant ethereum 2.0 is something that's much more substantial than many of these right so since ",
        "1": "um the ethereum project began with uh there's always been this expectation that no um what making blockchain consensus work in a way that's more efficient than proof of work and making blockchains more scalable than they are right now it is kind of part of what people expected as being ethereum right so proof of stake and shorting have been a part of the roadmap that we've been talking about since 2014 it's something that we've been actively researching for several years we've gone through many protocols many iterations and this proof of stake in shorting are still part of the road map today right but the difference is that unlike in 2014 now proof of stake and sharding are well on the path to actually arriving so for those who are not familiar or proof of stake is um there's some alternative approach to proof of work for securing a blockchain where instead of the ",
        "2": "blockchain being secured by this large set of computers that are constantly running the exact very expensive computations 24 7. instead of this you use coins inside of the system as a basis for the system's security so people who have coins inside of the network can participate as validators in the network and by doing so you can have the chain come to consensus in a way that's much more energy efficient cheaper and I would argue more secure in multiple ways than proof of work and shorting is this um upgrade which massively increases the scalability of a blockchain by moving away from the current approach where every computer in the network has to process every single transaction to an approach that says that each validator each participant in the consensus only needs to verify a small portion of all of the transactions and so by doing so the scalability of ",
        "3": "the entire network can be much higher than the scalability of any of one computer in the system so architecture right so the architecture of ethereum 2.0 looks roughly as follows at the center of the ethereum 2.0 system there is what we call the beacon chain and the purpose of the beacon chain is essentially to manage the consensus so the beacon chain stores information about the proactive proof of stake validators in the system what message is they have they have sent um it it the chain it acts as this kind of central chain that these Shard chains which actually hold data plug into and it is the kind of thing that the consensus itself revolves around the beacon chain has a connection to the existing ethereum 1.0 chain so it is a ",
        "4": "new chain but this is not a separate ecosystem this is this is an extension to if the existing ethereum chain and ecosystem and the bridge basically allows you to take ether and potentially other assets that you have inside of the existing ethereum 1.0 Network and move them through the beacon chain into the shards and into the ethereum 2.0 Network so if you have ether on the ethereum 1.0 chain and you have 32 East then you can send the 32 East into a contract and this um when you send the ease into the special contract it generates a Merkle proof it generates a chain of cryptographic hashes that you can then include into the beacon chain to prove that you did this and by sending the 32es into a contract what you are doing is you are registering as one of the ",
        "5": "proof-of-stake validators one of the participants in the beacon chains consensus so in the beacon chain itself keeps track of this validator pool this set of users that have put their own ether in and have agreed to help kind of uphold the security of the system and the consensus of the network runs between these validators so this is just a brief technical overview as to how the beacon chain Works um so time on the beacon chain is split into these six minute epochs uh during each six minute Epoch there are 64 slots um during each slot there is a block on the beacon chain um and each block um gets kind of signed first by a single block proposer and then it gets attested to it gets kind of approved by this very large set of validators basically 1 over 64th of the entire validator set and this process basically just ",
        "6": "continues kind of over and over again um and the goal of this is basically to be able to rapidly propose and rapidly agree on new blocks that are being added to the beacon chain right so at this what are attestations so here talk about this idea that every single block gets attested to by 164th of the entire validator set what do these attestations do so first of all they contribute to the fork choice so what this means is that every single one of these attestations which could be anywhere from 100 to tens of thousands they get added to every block can contribute to kind of solidifying that Block's position in the ethereum chain you can contribute to making that Block's position more secure so that once a block gets published within maybe even about three seconds um you there could be a very large number of signatures backing that block and kind of firmly entrenching that ",
        "7": "Block's position in the chain now if that's not enough there's also this other algorithm that runs in the background called Casper FFG and the purpose of Casper FFG is to give a kind of finality to a block so after this period of six minutes a block that gets included in the chain gets finalized at which point the consensus algorithm makes this final agreement on it and it cannot get reverted right so these two functions that contribute to Rapid consensus and this is a large Improvement on the existing proof of work chain right in the existing proof of work chain you have a block coming in on average every 15 seconds and if he wants to have security you might need to wait for maybe five maybe ten confirmations so really he needs to wait maybe up to two to three minutes to get some security and much longer to get much more security here you get a fairly high level of security almost immediately within like less than six ",
        "8": "seconds now the second thing that each one of these attestations does is it also is a signature a kind of message of approval of a block on some particular Shard right so basically the way that this works is that during each one of these epochs um every validator is randomly assigned to one Shard and there is a thousand and 24 of these shards in total and there are transactions and I am happening on each one of these shards and uh you as a validator get assigned to a random one of these shards and it is your job to for that period of six minutes validate the data on that chart and if that data is correct you would sign a message attesting to what the current um what the current block on The Shard chain is so at the stations both support the beacon chain consensus and they also support the uh and secure the consensus ",
        "9": "on the short chains and they also serve to link the beacon chain and The Shard chains together so consensus some runs on these two big algorithms one of them is this lmd ghost work Choice rule which is an adaptation of um this ghost and algorithm that was invented by um Jonathan sampleinski in 2013 to a proof of stake context and the main goal of lmd ghost is to be able to handle a network latency be able to handle fast messages and be able to kind of help rapidly confirm blocks even if many messages come in parallel right so the longest chain rule for example this is how ethereum comes to consensus now even if you look at the name you'll it's the longest chain it's it's not a mechanism that I can kind of get more security if you have more blocks coming in parallel lmg ghost is an optimized algorithm that can um now Casper FFG is this algorithm whose goal is to and of course finalize blocks so that after enough messages ",
        "10": "have been made on top of a Blog for some period of time that block just cannot be reverted so shards and crosswings um we have these um 1024 shards and inside each of the each of the shards people are sending transactions there's accounts there's activity happening on each one of the shards the capacity of each one of the shards is about the same as the capacity of the existing ethereum chain and the committee now on the beacon chain you have these committees right so what the Committees are is that basically this mechanism that says that the the entire set of validators the entire set of nodes that participate in the proof of stake system get kind of randomly shuffled and randomly assigns to one of these shards and the smaller set of validators that got randomly assigned to one of these shards has to verify the data that was submitted on that Shard since the um the last time a committee for that chart was selected so ",
        "11": "what this sort of kind of random sampling mechanism does is it allows you to get the full security or something close to the full security of the whole set of validators but only use a very small portion of the set of validators to actually check the each individual block right so the idea is that unless some attacker has a very large portion of the entire set of validators when one of these random committees gets chosen um there the chance that the attacker will have will be able to have say more than half of the validators in that committee is extremely tiny right so incentive security by random sampling so one of the interesting things that will happen in the ethereum system is um staking right so um if ethereum is moving from a proof of work system to a proof of stake system and part of this is just a kind of thing ",
        "12": "that happens in the background that makes the blockchain more secure but it's also a mechanism that you can participate in right so if you have at least 32 East you can deposit that if in this deposit contract after you deposit it you can wait a few hours and after that you are kind of quote logged in as an active validator right so when you're an active validator basically you're running a piece of software on your computer and this piece of software is just connected to the network that software has subcryptographic key inside of it and you're using this cryptographic key to sign messages basically saying which blocks in the blockchain you think are are going to be correct um validating has some rewards so the current expectation is somewhere between two two to six percent of the deposit value every year um if you go offline then the rewards for going offline are lower um but it's not too punitive right so ",
        "13": "even if you're on offline 10 of the time you still get some somewhere about about three quarters of the rewards you would have gotten um if you were online the whole time now this is not passive interest right you actually have to keep a note online you actually actually have to keep a vrifying transactions if your node does something wrong you can get penalized um and the cost of running a node the verification costs are in a proportional to the size of the amount of each that you're putting in right so if you put in 32 East then you only need to verify currently about 25 kilobytes per second of chain data but if you put in 320 years then you have to verify 200 150 kilobytes per second of chain data so this is a kind of very different from what and a lot the property is um that I mean a lot of other protocols have right in in the ethereum 2.0 protocol like we've been trying uh very hard to ",
        "14": "achieve certain kinds of properties that are difficult for um other Proto other kinds of protocols to achieve right so like first of all like this proof of stake and shorting system it's um basically actually allows a blockchain to process a very high number of transactions without requiring any individual node to process many transactions themselves and furthermore it creates this kind of egalitarian staking mechanism where a validator with a small amount of es that does not have kind of high fixed costs and a validator that had that staking a lot of Youth has to deal with higher costs of verifying transactions so there's considerable kind of technical complexity involved in making all this work right and a lot of the time people ask us well why do we need to do this kind of this particular approach to proof of stake and sharding why couldn't ",
        "15": "we instead you know just make a a simpler proof of stake blockchain where you just require that every single validator in the network has a very powerful computer has to process a really large number of transactions and where the number of these nodes is much smaller and the answer here is basically decentralization right so especially in in in any proof of work or proof of stake or any this kind of network where the consensus is controlled by this kind of economic mechanism there's always this constant risk that the network is going to become centralized that it's going to become this kind of concentrated by one or two pools mining pools staking pools exchanges large actors that then just ends up kind of grabbing control of the system and here like our goal in many ways is to try to ",
        "16": "push really hard against that right we're basically saying you know no you do not need to have a professional personal Mining and staking Farm in order to participate in the in securing the network if you have only 32 eth then you can just do it at home if you have if you have anywhere up to a few hundred each you might even be able to do it on your laptop now if you have more then you'll need a specialized computer if you have many more you'll need a very powerful server rack right but the goal here is that it should be possible to participate in the network kind of at all scales and the network should be able to survive even if these kind of Highly highly professional Central um centralized parts of the network just do not end up existing so technologies that make this possible I mean this includes some advances in cryptography including like BLS aggregate signatures a technology called ",
        "17": "proof of custody optimizations on Merkel proofs our work on Casper the consensus algorithm I mean a long time spent make just trying to make the protocol maximally simple scalable and secure and with this goal of you know preserving the decentralization of the base layer right so phases so this um and if the rollout over Theory M 2.0 is expected to come in multiple phases um and one of basically you can you can look at it this way right so right now we're here but really we're here right so really there's been a huge amount of work done out of already and what's left is essentially deployment right so phase zero is basically going to bring proof of stake so this basically means that you can deposit your e if you can start staking and the chain itself doesn't really have much functionality and this is a deliberate decision right the goal here is basically that the chain can launch and people can try out using the ",
        "18": "chain and the chain itself can can start running and operating and it's still kind of it's still a very early stage right the goal is to basically give time for the network and for the staking mechanism itself to under stabilize and prove itself um phase one data sharding so this basically means that The Shard chains start working except all they're doing is verifying data they're not verifying transactions they're not running smart contracts they're not verifying and a validity of transactions all they're doing is they're just verifying the data has actually been published and this already is actually usable for like a lot of some very interesting protocols um I had a presentation at the sole ethereum Meetup yesterday where I talked about something called ZK rollup and basically even just Phase One by itself can be used in a really scale blockchain applications phase two State and execution accounts smart contracts and like full ",
        "19": "functionality and phases three and Beyond basically further technical upgrades right so if you want to participate in the simplest place to learn is there are some updates that have been done by these ethereum ethereum 2.0 client implementations there is the specification that's kind of led by ISM ethereum Foundation researchers there's a site called ethub which has a lot of Independent Community Information and I mean the main ways to participate here is basically like ethereum 2.0 smart contract development um and and of experimenting with staking on tests that says something that's you know people coming very soon and it is something that you know I hope that people are going to find interesting right so the next thing I wanted to talk about is like what kinds of why a is all of this useful right like what kinds of things are we trying to accomplish with all of this ",
        "20": "um so a big part of the answer comes in what in Andreas talked about yesterday in the morning when he talked about um this um idea that at some point blockchain technology just in terms of its usability is going to reach parity with traditional systems and when that happens then suddenly a lot of things like instead of the question being well why should this be on a blockchain in some cases the question will be well why not put this on the blockchain definitely not in every case but in more cases than today and so if we look at the way blockchains work today the scalability is limited to about 15 transactions per second block times are on average about 14 seconds sometimes they go above one minute um privacy is in many cases almost non-existent and these so on this kind of platform like ",
        "21": "there's not that many applications that can really effectively survive and even if transaction fees are fairly low today there is a lot of applications that just aren't being developed because they know that if they are the application that succeeds then they themselves will be the ones that pushes transaction fees up to Infinity until like basically their application stops being useful because their fees are too high the goal of these improvements um is to just basically on every front try to make of cut down the difference cut down this Delta of usability between blockchains as they exist now and centralized systems right so scaling and the goal here is to improve scalability to increase the number of transactions that can happen on the network and to increase it to a level that seems like it's it's something that you can start working with two kind of power parts of the global economy right 15 transactions ",
        "22": "a second is not it here we're talking about potentially tens of thousands of of transactions per second and arguably that's still not enough but it's uh kind of it's a major stepping stone and it's um something that can be combined with other technology and other improvements later on hopefully to actually allow us to get there now uh proof of stake so in addition to proof of stake making the ethereum blockchain more efficient and I would argue much more kind of long-term sustainable and not dependent on these kind of constant technical arms races with gpus and Asics and one Asic Monopoly that might be disrupted by another Asic Monopoly now just to remove the needs to have all of these arguments about economies of scale and this one weird industry as a key security assumption we basically moving to this approach where ",
        "23": "the security of the system is just secured by coins inside of the system itself right proof of stake also gives us an opportunity to kind of re-architect many aspects of the system um and particularly um the one of the major pieces of this is this um architecture that we've had that we've developed where you have basically every block on the Chain instead of being confirmed by one additional block every 15 seconds it gets confirmed by hundreds to thousands of messages within a few seconds so here we're not talking about a system where like after you send a transaction you have to go get a coffee before it gets confirmed here we're talking about transactions where you can send a transaction to a merchant and the merchant can see and confirm the that the transaction is confirmed within about the same amount of time as it takes for the merchant to process a ",
        "24": "credit card and the I I personally believe that getting these differences in USA in usability really down and getting decentralized instead of based all your platforms to the point where they actually are powerful and kind of efficient enough that a from a just a user's point of view it's something that regular people can actually work with and it doesn't kind of impose all on all of these weird unexpected costs transaction fee is waiting to um waiting time um on them then we can start seriously seeing many more blockchain applications appear and especially in this sphere where we're not just talking about blockchain applications where like you only needs to have one transaction every couple of months but we're also talking about payments and potentially all of these non-financial use cases that ",
        "25": "people are talking about as well right if transaction fees are at a dollar then blockchain platforms or the the set of things that blockchain platforms are useful for is really going to be fairly limited but if we can cut costs down much more then we can get the costs of using these platforms down much closer to something that would be acceptable for a much larger array of Industries and that would allow us to actually test and see you know are there what kinds of things could block where what kinds of places could blockchains help you know if we had the means to because with this kind of with this kind of technology and I hope that we will have the means to so that is that is scalability that is a usability through things like reducing block times but this doesn't solve every problem right so for example this doesn't by itself solve the problem of privacy and that's something that we're ",
        "26": "going to be talking about in the next panel and there's also going to be the need for kind of ongoing improvements in technology but once the base layer itself is powerful enough then it's often becomes more and more possible to do those upgrades just by making kind of a second layer protocols on top of the existing blockchain right so the in general this kind the path of development of I mean both ethereum and blockchain Technologies in general um is something that where we still have quite a long way to go but it's um I think it's clear at this point that you know there is there's a lot of people working on making this happen and there's a lot of people working on making alternative approaches to scalability happen including layer 2 protocols State channels plasma lightning networks systems include I'm using zero knowledge proofs for security ",
        "27": "and many other things and so we really can't expect that within a couple of years the scalability a usability is all of the necessary properties of these systems are going to be much better than they are today and when that happens I think that you know we're not just going to see blockchains being kind of used for a few small Niche things and expand and a few experiments they're going to be something where if someone wants to build some put some registry on the blockchain build some application some application on the blockchain use the blockchain to just secure any kind of information then in many cases the default is that they will be able to right and I am confident that there are going to be things that will get built because like I go around around um and talk to many people I mean both inside of the blockchain space and also outside of it and while it is true that ",
        "28": "it's very difficult to get existing institutions to change their approach especially if they have an approach that works perfectly fine if you talk to people who are building new projects then you know very often like they will say that oh they're building something with some kind of blockchain component and there are people that you know really do believe in these kind of ideals of of transparent open uh decentralized networks as the backbone of their systems to eliminate themselves as Central points of trust and Central points of failure but we as developers of Technology need to make sure that when the time comes and they actually build the things that they want to build the technology is ready to accept it and that's something that I'm confident that we can we can work together and actually achieve thank you foreign ",
