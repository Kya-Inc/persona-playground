        "1": "lady with you Alexander and vitalik good to have you with us thank you very much for joining uh I am Anastasia the co-founder of restate foundation and this is Alexandra uh another co-founder of real estate foundation and we're very happy to have you both uh in this discussion what's happening in the world right now is that we have a front row seats to witness the damage we cost to each other and the planet preserving the status quo is simply not functional anymore civilization will be prompted to change in any case and the only question is whether it will change by force as a result of a catastrophe or by choice as a result of opening our hearts and Minds Humanity needs alternative ways of existence and coexistence this is why the restate Foundation was created we rethink current systems and Steward the transition of humanity to the next level of Consciousness we do so by rethinking ",
        "2": "our governance and self-organization and make it a more transparent participatory and at least partially decentralized we are engaged for that matter in research technology exploration and awareness building around the future of governance today we have the Technologies at our disposal that could either create phenomenal well-being for everyone or destroy the planet several times over we're on the risk of sabotaging Humanity entirely and I assume all of us would agree that people often make poor decisions while being unaware of what factors influence them that's why we at real estate Foundation believe that raising the level of Consciousness is essential for all of us for the future of governance and for the future in general that's how we can turn not merely into the architects of our own destiny but into collaborators in the collective Destiny of the human race re-state Foundation is delighted and honored to have a unique and first conversation with subguru founder of initial foundation and vitalik butarian ",
        "3": "founder of ethereum well even though each of you is leader in your own self consciousness and Technology it would be good to explore how involved you are and the other felt sogura as an author of inner engineering and the one who experienced the state of dimensionless unity of absolute perfection please share your interest and involvement in technology and metallic as the one who embodies the new era of technology and decentralization please share what kind of work you did on Consciousness as we all know that you are raised by a very conscious and spiritual father well uh you kind of cut me out of Technology but uh I'm profoundly involved in technology because in my experience this human mechanism is the highest level of Technology yet on the planet the people are calling some computers as ",
        "4": "Supra I have still not found one which is super more Super than this one it is just that we were given such a masterpiece of Technology but most people are trying to operate it without even reading the user's manual so it's one big mess but it's time to educate them to understand how it functions if we understand how it functions how we want to be will be by choice if how we want to be is by choice what do you think people will choose pleasantness or unpleasantness definitely highest level of pleasantness so in search of have a highest level of pleasantness well people drink alcohol people take drugs people want to go to Heaven All In Search of highest level of pleasantness but if you understand how this technology functions you can create the highest level of pleasantness right here I have ",
        "5": "enough you know evidence from modern science also I'm a living evidence I'm a living proof that it works and there are millions of people who who know that it works this is a technology which needs to be explored because this is the highest level of technology and we have gotten this technology after millions of years of research and development which is all dismissed off with one single word called Evolution evolution is research and development over millions of years and here we are all we're doing is making a mess out of it causing suffering to ourselves and once we know how to cause suffering to ourselves inevitably we will share it with the rest of the world and you can call it a war you can call it a famine you can call it whatever essentially people are sharing their misery yeah I think blockchains and amino crypto end web Serena are in an interesting field of Technology because ",
        "6": "they involve people a lot more than the other technical Fields do right like AI at least you know the way that AI is being envisions right now is often about the AI doing things by itself um of uh other fields are just about you know small groups of people in venting machines and in other species are doing kind of great things but in a way where people are not and directly involved except at the end of the process so they're like receiving it but uh what's interesting about blockchains is that they are a technology that is about uh you know human coordination and it's about helping um you know different uh groups of people come together uh to uh you know be able to trust each other bore to collaborate across larger distances on many different kinds of projects and the ",
        "7": "yeah the blockchain space itself I think reflects those values in a lot of way right and the people of the space talk to each other often the in the ATL space and I mean especially the ethereum foundation and the ethereum community or very International right so uh you know India theorem Foundation we have uh you know in office in Berlin an office in Denver one in uh you know Switzerland's one in Singapore um you know we have people across the world in you know Latin America Taipei Canada uh you know UK all kinds of different voices and like I personally have been a nomad for about nine and a half years and I know as part of that I've a good fortune to just interact with all of these people and I think just seeing you know what kinds of lives different people have is a kind of Consciousness in itself right it's uh you know seeing what kinds of different ",
        "8": "uh interactions there are between the cultures and kind of social Technologies and you know ways of life that people have uh evolved over Minotaur hundred thousands or hundreds of thousands of years as well as these uh very new tools that are being built very quickly and just you know to see how like what are the different ways in which they get different groups of people uh relate to those tools and caring about using them um I think as uh something that's uh fascinating and you know it's something that the yeah Community yeah I think we don't know really tries to value and get the most out of the one thing uh that's happening in the world is um environmentalists are talking about Consciousness technology people are talking about consciousness and Health Care Specialists are talking about consciousness so it's a good thing that Consciousness is a new coin of transaction in many ways but one thing we need to understand ",
        "9": "is that Consciousness can neither be a transaction nor can be a communication we are misunderstanding the different dimensions of intelligence which is invested in us and which exists in the existence if you can uh you know if I can take a few minutes please so it's like this we have different dimensions of intelligence I'll put it in a very simple way otherwise it will take too much time just to put it very simply one thing is we have a front end of intelligence which we call as our intellect if we are given a choice all of us I'm asking would we want a sharp intellect or a blunt one we tell it sharp or blunt sharp is better yeah [Laughter] top that's everybody's choice so we have a sharp instrument in the front if you have a sharp knife in your hand if you want to dissect something it's ",
        "10": "very good but so but suppose you want to stitch your clothes then you use a knife you know it will be like the present-day fashion where most people's clothes are toned by by Design not by default or Not by use so knife can be used in a certain way it's a fantastic tool for dissection opening up things and looking at it but if I want to know you Will I Know You by embracing you or Will I Know You by dissecting you which is a fact if I open you up I may see your liver kidney spleen and whatever else but one thing is I won't know you because you're gone but by including Somebody by embracing somebody you know something which cannot be known by dissection process so intellect is a tremendous and a fantastic tool for dissection and which is very important for our survival in ",
        "11": "this world there are other aspects of our intelligence which is one thing is called in yoga we call it a hankara which means the identity because identity defines how you use the intellect if you are identified with a race religion caste Creed nationality whatever else or gender the moment you're identified with that your intellect will do everything to protect that because it's essentially a survival tool it's you've been given this knife in the front front end of us is like a sword this is a survival tool without this we will not know how to survive in this world and this survival tool is used and wielded according to our identity how we are identified in this culture in the yogi culture always before we initiate a child into Education First thing is we are seeing how to make his identity a cosmic identity because right now I am identified with ",
        "12": "my race or religion or any other sect or group or a nation then my intelligence and my empowerment of knowledge will all be used to protect that identity maybe when it is small it looks selfish see if you fight for yourself they will say you're selfish if you fight for your country you're a great guy all right but the end result is same somebody will die it's not very different actually if you just fight for yourself maybe one person will die either you or him but if you fight for your country Millions May die all right so the problem is just this that we have not dealt with the identity properly once our identity is in some way limited to any aspect of life whatever it may be then our intellect will be against something we just don't realize this we think we're doing a great thing most people who did the most terrible things on this planet always ",
        "13": "believed they were doing the most fantastic thing many people still believe they are working for God and doing terrible things all right so identities with religion identities with nationality Community Family individual self it doesn't matter what the moment you have a limited identity your intelligence or your intellect will function only to defend that identity so there's another dimension of intelligence which we call as chitta when you say consciousness we're talking about that intelligence which is the basis of everything in this creation so that intelligence which you are referring to is consciousness or we refer to as chitta to be more specific is that type of intelligence which does not have an iota of memory because our memory is the basis of our identity in which country am I Born This is my country what gender am I this is my agenda what community am I this is my community this ",
        "14": "is all by memory if you just remove the memory people don't have any identity our identities are constructed on the mechanism of memory so intellect is 100 dependent upon the memory if you don't have any memory this word is no use only if it has memory so what kind of memory none of us have any universal memory our memories are all limited to the places where we are grown up whatever is the influence around us this is our memory we may evolve this memory into a little higher place but still memory is a boundary what I call as my memory is just a boundary around me so these two people are in my in my memory means oh they are within my boundary I know them somebody else is not in my memory that is a stranger because he's not in my memory so these boundaries are going on these boundaries are an outcome of an evolutionary process which is a little bit uh you know left undone we still have a ",
        "15": "Reptilian Brain where the need for boundaries is still strong within us so to evolve Beyond this is is possible on this planet only for the human being and that evolution is called Consciousness this is not an intellectual thought okay we are all one that's not going to help but when you touch this dimension of intelligence which we are referring to right now for the lack of English words we are calling it Consciousness or it's more specific and better to call it as chitta is an intelligence without memory if you touch this thing there is a in a very mischievous way in the yogic culture it is said like this if you touch your chitta then they say God will become your slave you make your own meanings out of that depending on your identities interesting thank you very much that Guru actually my next question is very related to what you have said and you have partially answered that already I'm ",
        "16": "going to go ahead and share the screen to for you to see uh the results of the study that we've recently been doing uh looking at the last 6 000 years of human civilization and what we see is an appalling Gap that appears between the technological capacity of human beings and our moral development the development of for the lack of the better English world we called Consciousness so I would be curious to to get your ideas on how you think this Gap might be closed in the next decades or years because it seems to be the only way forward for us until we hit the the brick wall and what do you see happening if this Gap keeps increasing maybe let us start with with italic like a really important points by yeah having starting to talk about identity right ",
        "17": "and identity is something that you know especially you know in the blockchain space we definitely um you know think a lot about and definitely you gotta talk a lot about right and a lot of adjacent spaces talk about it a lot like for example uh in the radical exchange the uh you know garupa created by Glenn Weil that who started with um you know quadratic voting and quadratic funding in harburger taxes and these kinds of ideas recently he thinks about identity a lot and uh one of his favorite ideas is this concept of intersectional identity basically that uh to the extents that people do see themselves as a part of groups people should not see themselves as being part of one group uh people should see themselves as a combination of uh all of the different groups that they were part of and I think you know he would say that this kind of identity is one that ",
        "18": "could lead to a more peaceful world than this a kind of single identity approach that we've been doing right because um you know if if one person from one country um you know C is a person from another country and they identify themselves only by their countries then they might start fighting but if they have a broader view of their identities they might realize that you know oh you know actually you know both of us really like cryptocurrency or you know both of us you know have very similar technical interests I mean we both have families that actually look look very similar you know we're both University students studying you know math suggested two years ago right and creating tools that make it easier for people to see these more complicated identities that they have and you know identifying the commonalities between them is one of the things that he really cares about right ",
        "19": "um so one of the agf ways in which I think this divide gets talked about is uh the difference between a kind of social technology um and uh purely physical technology and what these are not pure categories right like ultimately every technology is a social technology in some way like if you look at you know even AI for example right like the the way that they that AIS have been I think thought about in science fiction is as the middle very inhuman and alien Minds that you know just uh figure out what they value through kind of pure um you know first principle thinking but in reality the AIS that we see today are in spot they're literally trains from um you know billions of units of uh like work whether it's art or text or you know computer code or other things that have been done and put and put by people onto the internet in the last 30 years right ",
        "20": "and you know if you talk to gbt like it it doesn't look like it doesn't feel like an alien intelligence in some ways it feels you know almost more like a mirror of humanity right and you know blockchains and some of the things on top of blockchains like uh douse and for example there even more obviously that right like these are tools to help you know groups of people organize their tools to help people identify things that they value in common right so I could get coin grants and quadratic funding might be a good example there right it's a tool that helps people like basically yeah you know treats donations to projects as a signal of what people value and you know helps identify things that lots of different people value at the same time you know this is what we call public goods and uh you know like basically add a kind of even more support to those projects right uh so these kinds of ",
        "21": "Technologies I think can help us build both you know more of the kinds of physical technologies that you know make our lives better but also if we look at technologies that have a chance of making our lives but either better or worse uh try to kind of pull them in directions where the positive Tendencies are the ones that kind of get Amplified the most and so that's uh get the the strongest support and the strongest resources put into them right and I think these kinds of things are not going to solve every problem and people are going to you know continue to have uh disagreements but if those you know if if we can utter the more we can turn agreements in spirit into um you know actual uh realized cooperation in practice and turn uh disagreement in spirit into at best a learning opportunity but you know if it ",
        "22": "has to be kind of live and what live um in practice instead of active conflict then that's something that like I think we can benefit from and I think those are the kinds of ideas that I know a lot of people in ethereum and then those you know related communities really care about technology we must understand technology is an application of some things that we have figured out as to how they work and all technology is an outcome of our intellect because we have a certain intellect we are able to develop these Technologies but till now at least The Cutting Edge technology always went into military use so essentially if we get any kind of technological Tools in our hands ",
        "23": "first thing is we will see how to kill people then of course we will come back and save their lives so this is happening because we are unidimensional in exercising our intelligence our education system does not in any way even recognize that there are other dimensions of intelligence within the human being intellect is the only thing and even in the intellect what we regard as highest when you were in school Anastasia what what did they give you marks for they give you marks on you for your memory not for your attention not for your Genius nobody gave you marks for your Genius they gave you memory they gave you marks only for your memory now that machines are beginning to have more memory than human beings can imagine now they are feeling threatened and they are struggling so I would say instead of I know it's ",
        "24": "it's a very sweeping statement please don't think I'm against anything but if we want real change in the world because after all our lives are a tiny bit of time in our time if we want some change instead of technology is focusing on replacing economic structures and political structures if we focus on replacing the education structures which is the easiest thing to do and most accessible thing and nobody can control it anyway if we do that we would change the world in a much bigger way than trying to change the political and economic structures because there are many many aspects attached to it which I don't think everything has been figured out they have not been figured out there are many many aspects attached to it but in a small way a very egalitarian economic tool if it is going like whatever this blockchain technology and other ",
        "25": "things even if it represents one or two percent of the world's economy it could be a good reinforcing rib in the whole thing so that when something goes wrong there's somebody can fall back there are nations where their currencies have completely failed and their banks have failed and they're you know there are nations like that right now in the world in those Nations people are suffering immensely in those kind of conditions if there was a little fallback somewhere else it would definitely help people but if we invest technology and all the efforts that we're doing into Educational Systems and making them Universal in nature not National in nature I think that would change the world but we must have dedication and patience to wait and see how the nest next crop of human beings come up with a new sense of the world with a new sense of this this is happening in some scale ",
        "26": "but it's all happening randomly without any you know uh any kind of uh I know we I'm not talking about control or curation I'm just saying there is no direction to it it's just happening randomly which is leaving a lot of young people absolutely confused this confusion leading to a whole lot of an unhealthy percentage of mental illnesses suicides and all this is rising because young people are confused about fundamental things about life which we thought we had figured out we wanted to ask if our technology knowledge is like you already answered these questions with Guru if I can say one one thing about the what you mentioned just now is the technology neutral the question should go further down is there any human being who's really neutral there is no human being is ",
        "27": "neutral because the way you are right now your very body right now is a body of memory there's evolutionary memory there's genetic memory there is every kind of memory all right conscious unconscious levels of memory articulate in articulate levels of memory every cell in your body carries this you may not remember how your uh Grandparents were 10 Generations ago but maybe your grandmother's nose is sitting on your face you know uh uh your body remembers everything that your forefathers were a million years ago so who you are right now you are a productive memory whatever is a product of memory cannot be neutral it has a position maybe it's a more open position but still it has a position this is why I talked about chitta and Consciousness only when you transcend memory there is no such thing as neutrality but you can be about if you rise above certain things then ",
        "28": "you're not neutral you're just all inclusive and action will be as it is necessary for the given times of the day because action cannot be some Perfect action from somewhere action is always relevant to the time in which we exist the neutrality is an interesting topic I think because uh you know a lot of things in that we have today and that we try today they do they do strive for you know neutrality of some kind right so you know blockchains they strive to be neutral in the sense of uh you know not discriminating between uh transactions coming from different people and being open thought forms that accept everyone um International organizations uh try us drive to uh sometimes accept every country and you know be a forum for them instead of taking sides and I think there's a there is something new importance to the ",
        "29": "concept of uh the structures that do not take sides too much except on like one of some very small and particular things that are their mission and they try to leave room for people and other organizations to cooperate on top of them but then at the same time I think even you know in the crypto space itself that definitely started with building these end user structures from the beginning also uh under started to understand the value of uh intention and sometimes even the need to have structures that support opinionated uh perspectives on different things right and middle perspectives I definitely try to be inclusive but still end up being opinionated like even simple questions like if the API protocol has to change and it has to be upgraded then you know what is the upgrade that gets chosen or if some ",
        "30": "something like research or development or something else needs to be funded for the yeah protocol to continue to exist then you know how do we get choose like who to fund which which projects to find out of several different options and you know there's been a lot of fascinating work on mechanisms like quadratic funding to try to make these choices in a more decentralized way that tries to combine everyone's voices instead of only a few people's voices but even still like when designing these mechanisms I think it proves to be a impossible to avoid being opinionated to at least some degree right and sometimes you know being opinion it is good because you know we do have opinions and you know the goal is it's to try to get away from that the goal is to try to create combinations that are constructive instead of uh combinations that are destructive ",
        "31": "uh metallic uh I'm an absolute zero when it comes to uh I'm a blockhead when it comes to blockchain okay so you must treat me kindly but I will say what I have to say because the way I see it from outside the important thing is uh human beings the way they are made wherever they are they want to be something more this something more if somebody has money they want more money in that direction crypto can help somebody can have more money by doing a few things somebody has knowledge they want to have more knowledge somebody has technology they want to have more technology somebody has love they want to have more love somebody has well they won't have more wealth but human being is wanting more what is this more about how much more will settle ",
        "32": "if you make somebody the king or queen of the planet will they settle no they will look at the stars they will look at the galaxies so there is something within us which wants to expand in a limitless way there is something within us which does not lack boundaries within ourselves there is something else within us which is always instilling boundaries because this is a survival Instinct if there is no boundary you feel terrified if there is no boundary you feel there is no definition to who you are and what you are so boundaries are important for both physical and psychological survival of the human being at the same time the human being is longing to expand beyond all limitations because how much every human being has they want more compared to how much our grandparents had and how much we have today I think all of us have at least 10 ",
        "33": "to 25 times more or maybe much more unless your grandfather was an Indian Maharaja or something okay so doesn't matter how much we have this not going to settle so once we see that what we are looking for is Limitless expansion we must understand that trying to expand physically is not the point because physicality is a consequence of boundaries if there is no boundary there is no physicality we call this our body because there is a boundary to this if there was no boundary to this this cannot exist physically so physicality exists only because of a framed boundary so because our identification and experience of Life Is So related to our bodies we look at everything in terms of boundaries maybe bigger and bigger boundaries but still ",
        "34": "boundaries nature itself physical world itself treats us as about treats us with boundaries see we can be on this planet we can't leave the atmosphere and just walk away because this is a boundary set for us well we can break it with all kinds of Technologies but there is a boundary the very nature of creation is physical creation is boundary because all physical is only because of defined boundaries having said that technology enhances our empowers us to do things that we could not do before but it is not making us do anything absolutely new it is only enhancing what we can do all the machines we have created all the Technologies we are created or enhancement of who already we are for example we can walk because of that we have come up with all kinds of mobiles automobiles airplanes this that only because we can move if ",
        "35": "you were made like trees rooted in one place we wouldn't even thought of a bicycle for sure now we can see so we have come up with a telescope microscope all kinds of Scopes now we can speak so we have microphones telephones all kinds of stuff if you look at it everything we have done is only an extension of who we already are we can see this much that's not good enough right now you're in Zambia and the ladies are in Sweden is it Dubai the way okay let's close so that's why I'm able to see you you just close by so we're able to see you this was not possible 100 years ago if you had done this hundred years ago you could claim that you are a messenger of God or son or himself if you want if you could just show a picture of what's happening in Dubai or Africa to someone 100 years ago you would you know claim yourself to be ",
        "36": "anything you want so I am saying technology has extended our sight our hearing our sense of everything but it is not done anything new because technology is a consequence of who we are first of all so the most important thing is there are ways to see how to enhance this first if you enhance this the kind of technologies that will evolve and above all how we use it will change dramatically in the world so without transforming the human being we want to transform the world well I don't want to be discouraging but I've been around for very long you know without transforming the human being you try to transform the situation it's all temporary you can teach them any number of values you want three days they will be all right fourth day it'll go on as it goes on see after ",
