        "1": "me how there are good ways and bad ways to deal with the brave new worlds of blockchain and cryptocurrencies [Music] what do you think of like this the Singapore's approach to crypto and blockchain the Mas approach I definitely appreciate the amounts of effort that they've been putting into it and just like their willingness to explore many different kinds of applications and be supportive interesting their willingness to uh trying to like make a distinction between blockchain usage and cryptocurrency is like one of those weird things right because it's like it's like on the one hand it's sort of the mindset that every regulator has one to be supportive of technology and making things easier for people but like you know you find cryptocurrency weird and scary but on the other hand cryptocurrency do have ",
        "2": "this tight connection with each other you can't really have one without the other right like I think some of the Regulators in China definitely sort of tried to have one without the other and like the reality is I mean if you don't have cryptocurrency then like the blockchains that you're going to have are just fake and nobody's going to care about them but I guess the the line that they're trying to take is they're trying to like discourage cryptocurrency speculation but they're not actually Banning it and like you know people hear who wants to like you know buy sell and have cryptocurrency still can if they want to there's uh even like banks that support cryptocurrency custodial Services possibly a good um I think Korea could be a good balance do track the price of like really really closely sometimes but not always have you ever speculated at all in any crypto not really I just buy in the whole things but some of the like smaller countries are into cryptocurrency they are yes I mean some have gotten like much further right like there's uh a couple of small ones that have like e-residencies that ",
        "3": "are on the blockchain definitely a lot of like small countries where the government is very involved what are your views on that is it like safe for them it depends on how they do it like I think there's a good ways to do it and there's bad ways to do it like I think the the biggest risk of being friendly is if you end up like attracting the terrible people right like the thing with the crypto space is that it's very high variance right like you have these just really amazing and genuine people like I'm in ozuko for example and then you also have like Duke one and uh the problem is that if you get a certain kind of reputation it's like very easy to accidentally attract all of the Duke ones I mean in Singapore it's definitely true to some extent that the crypto space has not been sending its best right like there's a like Duke one actually himself spent some time here and then some of the people who are involved in the Luna collapse and part of that was like China stuff right because like as a result of the Chinese regulation but then part of that is like if you're friendly then um ",
        "4": "you know people who can't get anywhere else will come I appreciate the like the tough balance and kind of the position that Singapore in the UK and the Mas are in there and that's like it's definitely true that like if a country is not smart about it then you know they can easily end up just like being stuck as being I'm you know the base for all of the like Duke one people and that's uh not necessarily something that a country would want but on the other hand like it is I think it's definitely possible to engage productively and get a lot of benefits do you see any danger of ethereum being used for not so good purposes what can you do about that yeah I think like a couple of those things have happened right like there have been like defy hacks and those kinds of things the thing that we can do just as a community and that I think we've done fairly well at but we can do better is just like not have a community that's supportive of that kind of behavior this is like one of my greatest systems of the Bitcoin Community for example right is like they ",
        "5": "just automatically love everyone everyone rich and Powerful who supports Bitcoin right so if I remember the El Salvador situation last year right the president of El Salvador announced at a conference in Miami that there would be this Bitcoin law that would require people at El Salvador to use Bitcoin and a lot of Bitcoin people just kind of ignored the facts that um you know El Salvador was like or at least I mean government was also like very not democratic governments that actually yeah has a lot of problems and it's like actually not that good at respecting people's freedom and they just kind of let themselves ignore that because doesn't work our country is adopting Bitcoin and you know a lot of them you know went up on stage with him and kind of helped promote El Salvador but then you know what happened is like his entire thing was based on bitcoin continuing to go up and up and then Bitcoin ended up going down and now it just looks terrible and not many people are using it basically just because the way the Bitcoin adoption was done was ",
        "6": "like very top down enforced it just ended up not being very sustainable like that's an example of uh you know like the kind of mistake that a cryptocurrency community could do to like enable bad behavior but I think like in that particular case the ethereum community did Dodge the bullet right and like there's a reason why Luna was not built on ethereum I think the most that we can do as a community is just kind of Be Active in supporting good things and opposing bad things and then aside for that it's like you know like what else can we do like there's things that Regulators can do there's things that we as a community can do to educate users it is something that like everyone will have have to kind of like play some play some part of there there's a limit to like how much bad activity you can prevent but because it is an open system and like the the nature of the system means that it has to be open but there are lots of things that we can do and well you know there's a lot that we are doing and uh probably more that we could be doing so you do call out things on Twitter yeah yeah no idea ",
        "7": "how does it feel to be like so lauded so what no I did oh weird you haven't got used to it I guess I'm what used to it but you know do you think this people misunderstand about you I'm sure oh I mean from what you've read does anything like really bug you good question I feel like uh I don't know I feel like everyone kind of like projects parts of themselves onto me and it's weird like sometimes I see a description of myself and I just like totally can't relate to it like sometimes you know when people on Twitter make these memes of like myself with uh you know the really big muscles and like I'm like I don't know actually like I'm you know not that kind of person at all yeah I saw that one yeah they had a like a funding right yeah they do laugh or were you angry I think I left if there's any city that you feel is home which city would that be huh I feel like maybe Singapore more ",
        "8": "than anywhere else now actually I feel like in the last five years it might be the place where the city I've spent the most time some of them okay thanks very much [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] "
