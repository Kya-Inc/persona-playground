        "1": "Genovia please gentlemen partners friends guess you guys amaze me when this signup is faster than ICO if you're not imagine like you know this kind of style is just just insane and I believe that in some way might have frustrated some of you folks not coming in I hope you guys try to understand that we try to get you guys the best venue in Singapore and we were always trying to do so so Barry vas while we try to get a bigger venue in the future yeah so we started this group two and a half years ago zero people today it's about 2,600 people we are the largest in Asia fourth in the world almost catching up with Silicon Valley so give yourselves a pat on the back celebrating something thank you we have four or five events lineup for all girls in September we have swamp coming in next week which is part of the ETM foundation the team from Chennai will be speaking on that we have radar a real estate investments on the different blockchain we're speaking ",
        "2": "again maecenas and uh our piece on the blockchain is something interesting to look out for as well or happening or August September so first and foremost before I invite my dad to speak I have a very short message from the venue sponsor howdy please hi everyone I'm Andy from howdy and we're really excited to have partnered with SG innovate as well as DJ and the brilliant Vitalik here this evening for the etherium event as a lot of you are very well aware networking at times is fundamentally difficult particularly in a room like this we've got 200 250 people you might chat to the person next to you or you you'll just simply hand out vast numbers of business cards which is which is completely inefficient so what we've done with howdy it allows you to discover connect and collaborate with everyone in the room here this evening and as a lot of you are very well aware there's some very important and interesting people ",
        "3": "here that you want to meet and which you are able to do on howdy so if you haven't already download how to get connecting enjoy the evening looking forward to it thank you very much right so before we begin this talk you might the room might be a little warm because medium is always really hot right now so let's walk let's welcome by telling bill Turing to Singapore Oh guys up there on the second floor can you actually hear me wave if you can see fellas up it's not a wave so they can't okay great Abba so this is definitely by far the biggest meetup I've ever had in Singapore and I think in it's probably actually one of the three biggest I've had in the had in the world I remember there was one in London that went up to ",
        "4": "220 to 250 and one in Shenzhen in China about three weeks ago that also broke over 200 so I don't think there were ever any that broke 300 yeah the graduation Singapore um I've also definitely a big congratulations on very creative use of space with the staircase there no this is actually a really nice setup you can actually fit quite a lot of people in you just maybe want to put like 20 more VIP seats up on there yeah okay so the topic that I have been told to present about is basically to give a general update of we are at the area Mia's ongoing progress with things like metropolis ongoing progress with Casper ongoing progress with sharding and I will spend some time talking about each of those things and but also you know ",
        "5": "because this is a meet-up and I don't want this to be just myself talking at people about things that they may or may not understand side also welcome questions at every step of the way and I'm happy to generally answer anything that people are interested in asking about with the exceptions of future price predictions of ether or aetherium based tokens if you want to ask about future price predictions of the U of the euros and u.s. dollar exchange rate I can answer that but I don't think my opinions are very useful so first of all um how many people here know what Casper owes okay um how many people know what's the revert opcode is metropolis etherium the word course that last thought was a control a very disappointed that so few people know what courses are so okay no that's ",
        "6": "definitely helpful so Oprah for how many people is this their first aetherium u-dub okay go ahead a lot so I'll probably just start off by giving you kind of one to two minute introduction into what a theory a meals for the for the benefit of those who are if you're feeling you here so the basic idea behind etherium is that it is a general-purpose watching just to put it in very simple terms so a blockchain is as I like to describe it a kind of decentralized computer network that contains some kind of memory right and the reason why I gives this definition is because I think it captures then if two elements that make a blockchain important right so before we had block chains we've had decentralized networks for over twenty years so so how many people here have used BitTorrent every single one of you presumably you downloading legal stuff and how many people here have used some ",
        "7": "form of centralized online payments or online banking before Bitcoin existed here we go so decentralized networks existed before block chains existed and also the idea of systems that had some kind of memory in them existed before block chains existed what block chains do is they real bring basically bring together those two properties now why are those two properties so important so first of all decentralization is important for reasons that hopefully people here already appreciate so the idea is that we can build systems networks protocols institutions that are fully open fully public where anyone can participate in where there is no single party that is privileged over every other party and where there is no single party that you have to trust you order to trust that the network will keep on working so it is a protocol where the story for why you huge you ",
        "8": "should trust that protocol does not have to do with an already existing assumption that you trust any specific person now this is in the real world there are lots of situations where we already trust people so for many things we trust the companies we work for for many things we trust their governments for me for many things we trust Google Facebook Twitter but first of all even in those cases there are opportunities to build applications that do the same things that exist now but that don't require you to trust as much in second of all if you wants to build applications that are really global instead cross-organizational national boundaries and where the participants can be asked to be as small or as large and you know anyone from the richest or the poorest country then you wants to build systems that don't depend on the same assumptions of trust in the same way that's the centralization now second thing is why is memory important so I'll ",
        "9": "repeat the story that I tend to give in these situations quite a few times and the story is this in networks like BitTorrent let's say I have a a file let's say I have you know some some new book and I wants to send this a copy of this book to one friend I make that transaction I send this book this is a transaction that only myself and the person I am sending to have to care about no one else even knows that this transaction exists now here's the problem with applying this sort of thing to money let's say that I have 100 digital Singapore dollars and I send these 100 digital Singapore dollars to a friend now let's say then I create another transaction that looks exactly like the first transaction in this second transaction broadcasts the exact copy of the exact same 100 Singapore dollars to another friend I broadcast both of these transactions yay I have ",
        "10": "converted 100 dollars into 200 dollars we are rich we have communism basic income for everyone of course in reality if money works this way the Singapore dollar would hyper-inflated and Zimbabwe and as I've been led to understand so the Singaporean government cares about economic stability Eddy Singapore government people want to confirm that okay so the if he wants to have a system of true transactions of money or any kind of digital value it's any money as an inherently social thing to a greater extent to an extent that simple messages are not when I send a hundreds digital Singapore dollars to you that is not something that just myself in the recipients have to care about that's a the fact of that transaction is also a fact which is of concern to any other person in the entire community that uses that currency that might end up receiving that those digital dollars in ",
        "11": "the future that anyone else in this community needs to know that I no longer have these units of money and that the recipient Nell does have these units of money so this is why currency needs some  rememory currency is not the only application that requires some form of memory so the other one I typically go through is domain name registries right so the kinds of systems that you use to register websites you know so for example let's say I once I wants to register aetherium org the domain name and what would I do well I would go through this domain name registration process and I would send a few messages that say I wants to register this website but then what if three years later aetherium B gets big and some other less group less scrupulous and a less honest guide to set decides I wants to register a theory or two and so what the second guy does is he would go through the exact same ",
        "12": "sequence of steps that I went through in order to register a theorem to work and he would try to register the exact same website himself now clearly if we had a domain IAM system where the second guy could succeed it would be a complete failure because you know anytime a company got big anyone could just freely impress and yes here we have Microsoft comm please enter your private key I'd get a free xbox so the yum know if we wants to have a stable online economy then we needs to have this kind of notion of persistent identifiers and you know we needs to have some way of not having this kind of problem and so there's an obvious solution when you have two people who both register the same domain generally you want the first one to succeed and the second one to fail but now you have to have a notion of who is first and who is second and so you need a you need some notion of memory right ",
        "13": "so this is the idea of why memory is important so we know why decentralization is important we know why is that some notion of memory is important for many applications if you have applications where you want decentralization and where you want memory you want the blockchain so now why etherium right so block chains existed for quite a while before etherium there were systems like Bitcoin which did a peer-to-peer digital currency there were systems like a namecoin which did a peer-to-peer decentralized domain name system but then people started realizing maybe there is other things that you might want block chains for maybe there's other applications where you care about decentralization and where you care about having a memory you might want to use these systems to register other types of digital assets you might want to use them for some to exchange digital assets you might want to use them for contract smart contracts legal agreements financial contracts you might want to use them for crowdfunding you ",
        "14": "might want to use them as title registries and the number of use case has started increasing and so it started to become obvious that it doesn't make sense to have one blockchain for every single type of application and it doesn't even make sense to have one blockchain for ten types of applications what you instead want is to have one platform where this platform understands a general-purpose programming language where if he wants to build any kind of application you would encode the rules of this application in a computer program upload this computer program to the blockchain and then anyone any user in in the world can interact with this particular application by sending transactions that's let's say this is a transaction that wants to interact with this particular application that exists at this address and so you can have applications of very many different types many industries many use cases live on the same platform in the complexity of building your own thing ",
        "15": "that requires the centralization and memory goes down from the complexity of building an entire network from scratch to the complexity of writing a computer program and clicking upload so how many people here learn something from that explanation how many people here have learned something from that explanation who have known about a theorem for the last two years well okay so no that's always good to know that it's helpful so so that's kind of where the vision started right and the vision has probably evolved quite a bit over the last few years so for example when we started off it was mostly just about programmable money the idea yes you know we have this idea of peer-to-peer digital cash we can have a programming language and well we can stick this programming language and money together and we can create money which is controlled by computer programs so there was an idea that was created in 1995 by ",
        "16": "Nick Szabo called smart contracts and the analogy that he used to describe the concept is this think about a vending machine a vetting machine is basically a physical hardware device which enforces a particular set of rules and the rules are simple you put money in water comes out you do not put money in water does not come out now what the purpose of this physical device is to enforce this kind of set this set of conditions and to do so in a way that requires nothing but a mechanical contraption now of course if you if you really try hard then you can break the vending machine if the vending machine is designed incorrectly and if the vending machine has a bug in it then maybe you can put a bit of money and in three bottles of water come out and that's what you get if there is a broken vending machine it's if it's a if it's a physical vending machine code you know code is a lot three three bottles ",
        "17": "of water come out so the idea behind smart contracts is that to try to take this the kind of this idea of using physical hardware as a way of more cheaply enforcing kind of conditional agreements and bring it to the digital world the main benefit of the digital world is instead of unlike the physical world we our security is expensive where defense is expensive in where attack is cheap we are a ten thousand dollar gasoline bomb can destroy a ten million dollar building in the digital world it is defense that is cheap and it is attack that is expensive a message which is encrypted with a private key that costs one millisecond on a computer to generate will take trillions of years for even the NSA to decrypt so the that's the iam the digital world so what can we do with this well we can use the benefits of the digital world to create ",
        "18": "much more powerful digital lock boxes and we can try to use them to enforce these kinds of conditional agreements now in order for this idea to work there is a problem you need to have some notion of digital cache and furthermore if he wants the lock to really be trust us you need some notion of digital cache where the digital cache itself is trustless and so the idea is that now we have watchings and block chains give us this form of money which is natively digital we are the digital out thing itself has value without reference to any particular thing in the in the physical world so now we have a form of value which is natively decentralized and natively digital and we can create computer programs and we can create systems where the digital money itself can belong to computer programs and the computer programs might have conditions they might say if you give me solution to this math problem then you get a digital dollar if you do not give ",
        "19": "me a solution to this math problem then you do not give to get a digital dollar and so you can basically automate half the job of a math professor that was a joke so that was the kind of what one of the original use cases that probably motivated at least like a lot of the interest in smart contracts and general-purpose box chains as well and the reason why general-purpose ball chains are such a good fit is because if you have a general-purpose programming language then you can write smart contracts basically with any kind of conditions you want you can use them to represent bounties for math problems bounties for computational tasks escrow agreements financial agreements like insurance systems potentially you know things like decentralized autonomous organizations lots and lots of different things so that was the first use case but then we started to realize that general-purpose watch chains are not ",
        "20": "just about general-purpose smart contracts controlling digital cache general-purpose ball chains are useful for any kind of application that benefits from decentralization and the benefits from having some notion of memory so the number of applications that people got interested in and started to grow probably the first two things that people got excited about an aetherium were smart contracts and using it as a platform on top of which to build a decentralized domain name system now you might wonder well we thought we already had a blockchain that would do decentralized domain name systems and what's called namecoin and namecoin did not really go anywhere but then part of the reason why named coins did not really go anywhere is because there weren't really many things that were attached to it it was just a system by itself and there was not much incentive to integrate if you have a decentralized domain name system that sits inside of ",
        "21": "aetherium and this is an environment where lots of different applications are going to exist lots of different applications are going to talk to each other and there's going to be lots of user not already care about using decentralized applications for various purposes now you have a stronger network effect and you have a stronger kind of breeding ground for this kind of application to actually take for us so after this people were continued to get interested in know using aetherium for a lot of these different use cases many of which had quite little to do with money at all right so some of them had to do with decentralized provable blockchain based voting some of them had to do with things like identity management and supply chain tracking some of them had to do with various kinds of digital assets that were not financial video game tokens some of them had to do with ",
        "22": "just recording information in the blockchain you know there's a project that came out a couple of weeks ago called Leroy which is basically a theory and based decentralized Twitter now you might think oh well isn't it kind of stupid to stick to the stick in Twitter messages on to a computer in platform where everyone has to store every message forever well in the long term yes but for now it turns out that the transaction fee for sending one of these messages is still less than one cent so there you go now is even if you know you're you know you send a hundred a hundred messages a day one cents times 100 is one dollar a month to really set such a high price to pay for decentralization censorship resistance and a permanent globally accessible log maybe not so once you start creating you know a general purpose platform then all of these things can kind of start happening on top of it it ends this is what we've seen over the last couple of years and you know this is kind of the ",
        "23": "point where we're at now you know we're at this kind of tipping points where the mainstream is starting to realize that wait block chains actually work and they're actually really cool and they're actually really useful for these kinds of things here's the hard part everyone ready for the hard part anyone not ready for the hard part the yum exit I believe is over there so the hard part is even though right now adoption is going up and up and up and interest is going up and up and up and you know unfortunately there doesn't seem to be an opportunity to present slides today but if there was I had one ready that showed how today and yesterday aetherium for the first time broke through 400,000 transactions in one single day you know it's five a ",
        "24": "second 40% of ruber well ok I'm sure the uber rides are actually much more useful than we really message us but you get the idea but the difficulty that we still that now remains at this point is basically technology the fact is watching technology as it currently stands is just not good enough in order to fulfill the full vision of decentralized you know applications with memory for the masses where the masses are defined as not just a billion millions but possibly hundreds of millions and in the long term future billions of users so what are these obstacles and I can talk about the smaller stuff so I can talk about things like privacy I can talk about security I can talk about usability I can talk about you know blockchain security blockchain efficiency smart contract ",
        "25": "auditing and I will touch on those things later but probably the biggest one by far is scalability so here's the problem with watching scalability a blockchain with the weight that it currently had works now is a platform which gets its decentralization from the fact that every single node in the system downloads and processes every single transaction in the system and verifies each and every one of these transactions for itself now this means that first of all you have decentralization and it also means you have a lot of backups we are very very far away from ever worrying that any single etherium block will ever become fully inaccessible and lost but the price is efficiency and here's the best way to think about the price if every single node in the network has to process every transaction this means that the network as a whole cannot process more transactions than one ",
        "26": "single node this is bad you cannot have the world economy be processed on one single guy's computer so we have a problem now you might say oh well we have more so wine people's computers yet twice as good every two years up to some point sure you can scale blockchains up you can bump block sizes off and that works fine but eventually you start to realize oh wait well at 12 transactions a second we have uber at 200 transactions a second we have PayPal at 2,000 transactions a second we have visa at 18,000 a second we have the Shanghai Stock Exchange at 1 million a second we have we expected 25 billion devices that are expected to be IOT within the next 10 years so there's a lot of demand current blockchains process bitcoin does 3 a second and aetherium has now gone up to 5 a second now you might say gay ",
        "27": "bitcoin but which is bigger the difference between 3 & 5 or the difference between 5 and a million quicker thinks the difference between 3 & 5 is bigger oh wow zero people hmm so no it's interesting that there's exactly zero because there was this article that idea that I want a rat on a blog a few weeks ago the talks about this thing called the wizard man coefficient which basically suggests that about 4% of people if you ask them in polls literally believe a lizard and run the world and apparently about 4% of Obama voters in the US believe Obama is the Antichrist so salute there's supposed to be this kind of coefficient 2 for people who answer silly stuff in polls just for the hell of it but this time we got 0 um I'm nosey please do not buy neo sell your new ",
        "28": "[Applause] oMG that was brazen so okay um take out your phone sell your neo 30 seconds okay so the mi5 in a million is bigger than the difference between three and five by a lot so the reach of these examples is the getting from the kind of scalability we have now to the scalability that we need in order to achieve decentralization in large portions of the real economy doesn't just require tiny tweaks it really requires kind of fundamental changes and rethinks and breakthroughs you know and very deeply ",
        "29": "changing the way that block chains currently work are designed and are used and there are several different there are definitely kind of short-term strategies that you can use in order to make existing etherium implementations five times more efficient in order to make the protocol 50 percent more efficient in order to make people's use of the protocol twice a two to four times more efficient and you can get a bit up there and that might be enough for half a year might be enough for a year but if you want to go further then you have to kind of break through the fundamental barrier and I'll talk about probably two major techniques and by the way you should sell some more neo please remove the sign thank you disclaimer we do not support anything related to tokens yes so you should ",
        "30": "purpose I so there's three there's probably two major strategies that you can employ in order to kind of really fundamentally change the way that you use your blockchain to make your usage more scalable and I'll try to explain both of them in a semi technical way so the first strategy and this is a fairly general strategy is basically this the only case where you really need a kind of trustless way of getting everyone to agree of getting consensus on some particular fact is if there actually are people who disagree about that fact so if there are people who disagree whether this key this coin belongs to me or this coin belongs to you or whether some domain name belongs to me or some domain name belongs to you then we need some form of strong ",
        "31": "consensus strong agreement to adjudicate between the two and securely reliably and permanently and immutably choose one or the other in the cases where you don't disagree you do not you there in general there are going to be ways to avoid having to use a blockchain entirely so I'll give one one simple example and this is a technology called payment channels and this has existed for in kind of theoretically at least for since around 2012 the concept of payment channels works as follows let's suppose that I am an Internet service provider and I am selling you Internet service and let's say we have agreed on a rate of let's say 1 cents per megabyte and you know we let's say that you start using like using a connection here is what we will now here's the naive way to do this every time you use a megabyte you're required to send a blockchain transaction that makes that one payment of one cent and unless you send that transaction I shut down service this ",
        "32": "clearly works the problem is though that if you're going to send a transaction every time he needs to spend one cent that your transaction fees are going to be way higher than the amount of money that actually gets sent so here is what you do instead when used you start your connection when you kind of sign up as a user you put let's say $100 something that we will call a channel so what you can think of a channel as being a smart contract it is a computer program and the computer program will have certain rules that I will explain later then let's say you then use one megabyte in order to keep using my service I will then ask you it's a sign a ticket I will ask you to sign a digital message and the station whole message now says I have paid one cent then let's say use another megabyte I will ask you to sign another digital message this next a tional message says I have paid two cents then I will ask ",
        "33": "you to sign another digital message saying I have paid the recess then I have paid four cents I have paid five cents now let's suppose that then in the normal case eventually you wants that you wants to cut your connection and he wants to get your money out here's what we do you would say you would submit the last ticket that you sent into the smart contract and the smart contract would see oh this ticket says you have spent $10 and so the contract decides okay well I should we should now give $10 to me and refund the $90 to you right so then you get back your $90 I get my $10 and we go on our merry way this is the best case now here's a second case let us suppose that I go offline so I just decide I am going to be malicious or I got hacked or whatever happens then you can still ",
        "34": "submit the ticket and your ticket by itself can get you the money back now here we're going to try the third case the third case is you were malicious in this case you are not going to send the last ticket that you signed that says that you pay $10 instead you are going to submit the first ticket that you signed that says that you paid one cent so then here is how the smart contract deals with this problem this Marc contract yet provides a time window during this time window I have the ability myself to submit the tip the last ticket that you signed the ticket that I believe is the highest value tic is the ticket that should have had that should be the correct one the smart contract has a rule that says it will accept the highest valued ticket that was submitted during this challenge period whatever the highest value ticket is it accepts as a truth and so if you try to cheat me then I will submit my ticket the ",
        "35": "contract will adjudicate and you will still get just 90 dollars back and I will get the ten dollars that I deserve now notice that in this kind of scheme if nobody cheats then only two transactions need to get sent the first transaction is you joining the channel the second transaction is you leaving the channel if you if you cheat then three transactions need to get sent the first transaction is you join the channel the second transaction is you fraudulently try to leave the channel and the third transaction is I counter you now technically in etherium we'll also need to send a fourth transaction to actually finalise the payment but you get the idea notice that in this case even though in reality is you have made something like a thousand payments to me even still the blockchain requires two transactions in the best case for transactions in the worst case so why is this happening because the way the mechanism is ",
        "36": "designed is that it only uses blockchain transactions first to exit the system and to enter the system but otherwise only if there is a dispute only in the specific case that the two of us disagree about which ticket should be used are there are there extra transactions that get cents to the watching so this is just one example now there are other systems so for example there are some a developer based in Toronto name's Jeff Coleman and you can look up his work on something called state channels which is basically a fairly advanced generalization of this notion that goes beyond just payments and he talks about this kind of very elaborate notion of counterfactual contracts contracts that do not even exist on the blockchain at all but people treat these contracts as doubly exists because if someone were to try to cheat by acting as though the contract does not exist the person who would be negatively affected by that decision would in fact be able to submit this ",
        "37": "contract to the blockchain and the contract would be effective so if there was a dispute this contract could it could be submitted and it would have force knowing and that if Lee tried to cheat this would happen people would not cheat and therefore most of the time these transactions do not need to be submitted and these contracts in reality never need to be created at all there was also a system called the Lightning Network which basically works by combining together on networks of payment channels and basically routing payments from one person to the other through a sequence of these kinds of channels there was also a paper released about one week ago called plasma which has made fairly big in use so I'll talk about that a bit it actually also uses a very similar paradigm so the idea was plasma basically is that you can have a kind of think of it as a side chain so it's like a separate chain from the main chain and this separate chain is managed ",
        "38": "by some other set of validators it could be centralized it could be proof of stake it could be one of many mechanisms now you as someone who has let's say ether on the main chain can send your ether to the side chain then inside of the side chain you can make transactions and if you want to send your itzá withdraw your ether then you send another transaction on the main chain and get your ether back now normally you can imagine many many transactions all happening inside of the side chain and the main change is never find together about any of them now what's suppose there is a dispute what is a dispute a dispute basically means either a side chain block gets created which is invalid or a side chain block gets created with missing data if this happens then there is a mechanism where every everyone who had coins in the side chain before the faults took place 10 will through other points so only in the ",
        "39": "event that there is some Fault in the side chain where there is some dispute are you going to need this larger number of main chain transactions to start happening most of the time there is not a dispute and so most of the time the main chain does not need to be used so you can imagine these side chains as potentially being used for many different applications you can imagine them be used for payments you can imagine them being used as a decentralized exchange you can imagine them being used for general-purpose computation anything that's parallelizable as a Joseph poon says anything that can be map reduced you can imagine them being used to run potentially even as complex applications as you would run on top of aetherium itself now what are the security trade-offs of this one of them is if somebody wants to cheat you they cannot cheat you but what they can do is they ",
        "40": "can force you to wait they can force you to wait two weeks to get your money back they can force you you know to spend to send each in a transaction on the main chain wait an entire challenge period and after two weeks get your money out so people cannot steal from you but they still can annoy you this is the first security trade-off the second security trade-off is a somewhat more serious one and the security trade-off is this let us suppose that we have networks that everyone on aetherium uses plasma lightning networks state channels payment channels for everything let us suppose that even if the capacity of the main aetherium chain is ten transactions a second we can imagine a million transactions per second happening on these secondary networks now let's imagine there is an attacker in this attacker is a fairly large entity in ",

        "84": "this is a system that we are all these different diverse groups can benefit I think is something that we showed even if you continue to strengthen thank you yes thanks a bit launch it recognize the papal shares on the token ethereum platform and we are expecting to add about 10,000 equities in depth recognize it there will be thousand transactions per second so what do you think when a failure will be capable to support it so I would recommend that if you are building an application that will need to support thousands of transactions a second for now either put it on an etherium based consortium chain so for example there is a company in Taiwan called Emmy that released a consortium chain version of death that gives you about 500 transactions a second a month ago or in the slightly longer term build a system on top of plasma and in the ",
        "85": "longer longer term you know hopefully if aetherium itself will become kind of full will become shorted and the public chain will be able to support a much higher load and you know when that happens and you can do a plasma on top of that and get even more scalability ok sorry let me see what Thomas here was just about plasma yeah no it wasn't looking for a shout out I just wanted to clear you I wanted someone to clarify that plasma is not exactly a sidechain the plasma is not not exactly a sidechain right I mean it's like not a federated sidechain correct which is what people would normally think of right now so the security model of plasma once again is that if you know plasma chains can be either a consortium chains or proof of stake chains or one of many mechanisms and the security model is that you do not have to fully trust the mechanism that's running listed to the Chou chain if the shower chain works fine everything works great if the child chain consensus breaks then ",
        "86": "the attack on the child chain can delay everyone getting their money out by two weeks but it cannot cause people to lose their money unless there is this really really huge amount of usage and you have this kind of systemic risk attack but we know we're still I would say if you are way far away from that so okay I guess we don't have much type of questions as if any other questions please reach out to the channel he mentioned early on to regular channels asked him before I close all I just like to encourage you guys that this whole meetup was set up for community purpose so go around talk to startups around here we have guys for the 10x at a talk give a shout out yeah we have my DJ Screw my dj''q steam is we're all in a bag we have swiped crypto somewhere around here there's a lot of other startups around here there are always you know coming by create a diversity that people talk about so I believe that this kind of meetups are all generated to create conversations not just with the founder of course themselves but among yourselves we all ",
