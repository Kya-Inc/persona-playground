        "1": "all those things and like actually provide value for hundreds of millions of people ethereum is going to explode over the next 18 months for three main reasons firstly following EIP 1559 which introduced The Burning mechanism to ethereum which then later combined with the merge of the ethereum supply has gone deflationary on the website ultrasound.money you can see that even in a bear Market the burning of ethereum far outpaces a new issuance of ether leading to a deflationary asset ethereum is coming up to net negative 200 000 ether since the merge thanks to things like investors trading meme coins such as Pepe and keep in mind this is during a bear Market imagine what will happen to the supply of ethereum during a bull market with the amount of ethereum that is getting burned secondly in just under one year's time we have the Bitcoin halving although not directly related to Ether the Bitcoin halving always has resounding effects on the entire crypto market and it's a narrative that will inevitably bring Capital flows to ",
        "2": "ethereum as well thirdly in vitalik's most recent interview he believes by the end of 22 23 ethereum is going to be essentially finished with Roll-Ups and layer twos and will be much more user friendly in terms of gas fees and user ability he claims that he wants to be ready for ethereum to have 500 million users before it has 500 million users ethereum currently has around 4 million active users meaning he is expecting over a 100-fold increase in adoption just imagine what this would do for price before we delve into vitalik's latest interview only a small percentage of my viewers are actually subscribed if you enjoy Finance content consider subscribing or liking the video it's free and you can always change your mind is that 2023 is going to be the year when um you know Roll-Ups really come to maturity we have 4844 that gives robs more space and we have the training wheels on Roll-Ups like really get weakened um a lot um and like basically yeah we go most of the way to the Assassins you know ",
        "3": "ethereum scale leg being this kind of fully trust us and uh but you know most of the way to be in full Hustler so most which most richest system that kind of gets us to like most of you know what we would call sharding being finished and then after that there's uh Roll-Ups going fully trust to us and then there is full tank sharding and I think those things are going to take a couple of years longer but like for me personally I think after the changes in next year like that would be the point the first points where I would feel comfortable saying even if nothing else happens past that point I would be happy with ethereum right and that to me is like a the like my yeah like that that's the personal milestone for me right like the uh you know equivalent of uh like when can we call ethereum done if we really have to call it done well end of 2023 right so merge done withdrawals done uh so be being able to withdraw from the proof of stake system ",
        "4": "um you know basic scaling done um you know a lot of basic improvements done um enough cryptography added to ethereum though we can support privacy uh Solutions that's the layer on top and you know if we need to we could stop there but at the you know we're not going to stop there right and we want to kind of like go ahead and try to actually make sure that the ethereum ecosystem can support 500 million users before um you know the ball were 500 billion users are knocking on the door actually yet you know ends up happening that's great uh so that's uh you know that yeah okay so that's the that that's probably the next part of the future you know the transition from ethereum as this kind of fear very theoretical ecosystem that's still discovering and finding itself to ethereum ambassad ecosystem that actually is you know tries to be useful and usable and uh you know secure and and all those things and like actually provide value for hundreds of millions of people be it around 2020. um this is I think another one of these uh trivia ",
        "5": "that uh is well known within ethereum circles but probably does it hasn't really kind of filtered out you know the wider narrative mean blacks is uh the roll-up Centric roadmap right this is basically this idea that instead of ethereum itself trying to kind of boil the ocean with scaling and insert itself into this complicated hyperscalable system we would make some changes to ethereum that would make it be more friendly to people making layer 2 scaling Solutions right solar two scale like Solutions are like protocols that try to do the same thing that ethereum does but that plug into ethereum for security without doing every single thing on top of ethereum right so most of the work would happen often but just enough work would or could be done on chain that if something happens the ethereum system would kind of keep the rest of the system honest right so one of the defining analogies for layer twos in general is like the Supreme Court ",
        "6": "right like the concept of a exactly the Supreme Court is uh what things are kind of ultimately rest on but you don't literally we have the supreme court hearing every single kiss right you have a whole bunch of these appeals courts and like a whole bunch of lower courts and then you just have the fact that the threat of a court case being possible uh can drive on this Behavior without uh most of that behavior ever needing to get into a court system right that kind of analogy drives the lightning Network which is that basically the only kind of Layer Two that's possible on bitcoin and it also drives you know State channels which are the lightning Network equivalents on ethereum as well as Roll-Ups which are this more complicated thing that was only discovered later on ethereum that are actually powerful enough that you could use Smart contracts on top of them right so lightning Network and state channels support transactions and they support uh if you're limited kinds of Contracting the Roll-Ups they support like kind of ",
        "7": "full-on EVMS that are that kind of get indirectly verified inside the evm um so layer twos um have kind of been the ethereum scaling Direction since then and since then there have been these discussions around data availability right basically the the Practical capacity limit to a layer two is how much data the ethereum chain uh chain itself can store right because uh one of the trade-offs of Roll-Ups is that they do require the ethereum chain to store a few bytes of data for every single transaction like a lot less than using ethereum directly but still a settlement of data and and that's where stuff like data availability sampling and eip4844 which is uh looking um scheduled to come um you know early to bed maybe maybe later next year is is all about exactly so three oh you know well prototypic charting is like a bit ",
        "8": "of a pun right because uh so first they're starting and then there is dank sharding which is uh this uh version of uh sharding which was uh created by ethereum a researcher named dankrad and then there is Proto dangsharding which is called that because it's a stepping stone to full dig sharding it doesn't technically Shard data yet though it does Shard history and computation um but it was also created by another ethereum researcher his name is proto-labda right uh so yeah so prioritive charting happening next year and the other thing that uh like I've talked to the roll-up teams that they all want to do next year is they want to start taking off training wheels right so the Roll-Ups and the layer twos that exist on ethereum today they basically all have what I call training wheels like some kind of back door that lets developers uh come in and like say stop and change a protocol if they see that some kind of bug has happened and like training wheels are obviously a uh you know an affront to the moral idea of ",
        "9": "trustlessness and all of those things and nobody wants training wheels to be the status quo long term but basically yeah they're like a compromise saying okay people um like we want to hit the ground running and we want applications to be able to start um you know start deploying on the way or two is before we can be fully confident that the thing that the thing has no bugs and so we're going to have a back door for a while and then once uh things are stabilized and once we're confident enough in the code then we can finally start switching the back doors out right and all right so next year uh yeah some of the projects are going to actually I I think might be actually taking their back doors out some of them are going to be kind of limiting their back doors and going to a hybrid right where a back door exists but there's like it's not like one person that that manages it and it's not even a multi-sig with a 51 threshold it's like a multi-sig with an 80 threshold or a 75 ",
        "10": "threshold with members that are like highly distributed between a bunch of different organizations and so it's like a halfway house between uh you know being a yeah kind of trusted sidechain uh the in the style of um you know something like liquid or in the South something like polygon today versus being a fully decentralized system right where it's like you know the humans have half the votes and the code has half the votes there's probably one sort of mathematically accurate way to think about it and so it's like the senate in the house if you want to override the code you know exactly well like if the uh you know if even a majority of the humans are dishonest as long as like unless you know you have like almost all the humids are dishonest like if it's just a majority then you know the code still kind of carries the day right but so the idea would be that if there is some political controversy um that then you know you're not gonna you know you could see yourself getting ",
        "11": "51 of the humans but um you know you're not gonna get like 80 percent of the humans whereas if it's a bug then like that's something where it's easy to get like a you know 100 uh uh even agreement that that the buck needs to be fixed you know not total uh kind of uh you know take the training wheels off and leave it to the code but like a very large step toward that thank you foreign "
