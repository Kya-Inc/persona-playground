        "0": "thank you so um today here I wanted to go through a bit some of the history of uh I mean look at the ethereum project and where we started uh back in 2013 and uh 2014 and some of the changes that we've uh you know that the project has gone through since then and like how we think about some issues in a way that's uh different from even like how we thought about them five years ago or uh 10 years ago um so because um so if we hear uh who here remembers the ethereum white paper this was uh oh ",
        "1": "Heroes read the ethereum white paper any part of it this is uh a document that we published back in uh 2014 that basically describes some of the initial Vision that we had for the pro for the project right and in the white paper we already described some of the basic ideas behind ethereum uh basically that ethereum is this decentralized system similar to bitcoin it's a blockchain except the big difference is that unlike most of the previous systems that existed before which only tried to support one application um ethereum has a built-in programming language which allows the users to build their own applications so that the ethereum and then you can write your own application as a piece of code then you upload that code on into the blockchain and then that application runs on the runs that code and that piece of code is ",
        "2": "your application right so you're not just using one application um you you are there it is okay I mean so you're not just you know using right the blockchain is not just supporting one application the blockchain basically lets anyone create their own applications that then um it's okay um that then get that then get added um on top sorry confusing right so anyone can write their own their own applications and upload them and these applications can talk to each other anyone can use those applications and they're all part of the ethereum ecosystem so I uh you know at the beginning of this white paper I talked about some of the ideas that other people have had some of the ideas that I have been starting to have so covered coins is the or one of the early protocols on top of Bitcoin for issuing your own assets so today on ethereum we have erc20 but back ",
        "3": "then we had covered coins and covered coins was this early attempt at making a protocol for issuing your own assets on top of Bitcoin um actually what's interesting is that very recently there is a like a very limited and very specific version of covered coins called ordinals that is on top of the Bitcoin protocol um so actually yeah something like covered coins on bitcoin is having a bit of a comeback right but code coins is only one application um you can have tokens that represent access to physical objects um that was called smart property back then um you can have other kinds of assets so like domain names are a good example right so um you can basically have a system on the blockchain for registering websites registering usernames you know like keeping track of names that like users and applications use and you may do this in a decentralized label doing ",
        "4": "it all on chain the concept of a smart contracts this idea that you can have computer programs that live on the blockchain and those computer programs can directly control digital assets right so an assets does not need to be owned by a person and asset can be owned by a program and this concept of smart contracts can be used to implement many kinds of more complicated applications so for example you could have prediction markets you can have uh you know Financial gadgets I mean like things like stable coins analog leverage all of the different things that D5 offers I mean then there's this concept of a decentralized autonomous organizations which is basically using a smart contracts to implement the voting Lodge or governance logic of an entire organization on chain right so instead of like dispute resolution for an organization needing to be done by a ",
        "5": "legal system you can have this very low cost way of just doing that directly Unchained so a lot of the yeah like Concepts in terms of applications have basically been like here since the beginning and a lot of these Concepts have basically stuck um you know like even until this day right so a lot of these uh Concepts have uh you know we we have these things today right we still have you know before back then we had covered coins today we have erc20 tokens uh back you know back then we had smart property smart property actually has not really seen that much progress but like we do have on chain ticketing now um name coin we have ens and lots of people use EMS right so like my own blog actually yeah has it is uploaded to and it is accessible through ens right so if you do a who's in ethereum enabled browser like I believe if you use Brave you can do this you can type in vitalik.eth and you just ",
        "6": "get like the the front page of my blog right so it's a subject that you can use and it works um smart contracts and gaos there are many kinds of daos worldwide that use of many different kinds of logic so they're so far has this hasn't really seen huge adoption outside of like projects within the D5 ecosystem but you know they exist and many of them have been operating uh pretty well for years so that was so that's I mean like some of the applications that we've seen right now there have obviously been other applications that have come in that have just completely surprised me um so nfts are a good example I yeah I did not predict crypto kitties I did not predict um another monkey is I did not predict nfts but a lot of the other things that exist today are basically very similar ideas to what we had 10 years ago ",
        "7": "um so research on proof of stake right so today we ethereum finally is a proof of stake chain right and uh proof of stake has uh greatly you know increased ethereum security it has reduced ethereum's energy consumption by more than 99.9 percent and so before Pro what was called the merge the full switch to proof of stake of ethereum last year ethereum consumed about I think as much electricity as like either I believe it it was like 40 percent of Singapore and now that's reduced to like basically zero and so it's uh you know proof of stake transition is finally complete but this is a thing that we have been working on in the ecosystem for the last 10 years right so the first five years of proof of stake development were basically research right basically us trying to understand ",
        "8": "what proof of stake is what all of the different options are in the proof of stake space before finally converging on like the particular version that actually works right so this is a picture from a blog post from 2015 where we basically have describe a mechanism called consensus by that you know which attempts to essentially have validators send a series of messages expressing higher and higher levels of confidence in a particular Block in order to try to agree on a uh a Blog much more quickly than you can in proof of work um so it turned out that that our consensus by bed had a lot of flaws and it was needlessly complicated and it was actually much worse than a kind of much simpler protocols that ended up turning into a Casper FFG but it was you know a step along the road to us understanding the space better now actually for anyone I'm interested I made a Twitter thread ",
        "9": "back in 2018 and if you want to see a just a scan my QR code and uh basically in that Twitter thread I go through the Journey of uh you know ethereum is proof of stake research and basically how we went from first starting to explore and being okay with maybe proof switching to proof of stake at some points in the future until we finally decided on the on the exact algorithm so first five years was research then you know next four years after that was development um scalability right so scalability is this uh super important thing for ethereum right because uh as of today the ethereum blockchain only supports somewhere between 10 and 20 transactions per second um and what between 10 and 50 actually depending on like how complex and how large those transactions are um now the this is a very small level of scalability right if you want to support ",
        "10": "mainstream Finance mainstream payments um and you know systems at a global scale you need to have something closer to 100 000 transactions per second right if we only have 20 transactions per second the world population is uh 8 billion so it will take 400 million seconds which is uh about 13 years for people to um you know like be able to do something on chain even once right and so increasing scalability is just a very big deal now the very early efforts in improving scalability it was uh called sharding right and so what we're doing still is a a form of sharding right but a lot of different things have been designed and changed to this mechanism since then so the idea of shorting basically is this a simple blockchain like Bitcoin has limited scalability because it requires every single computer on the network to ",
        "11": "process every transaction so let's change the design instead of every node processing every transaction every node only processes a small portion of transactions right it's like how BitTorrent works for example right BitTorrent lets people share you know like many many terabytes of data but like BitTorrent does not require like literally every person to store every file right because that would just be way too much data for people and so the challenge is like how do you do some kind of BitTorrent like scaling but still have it be a consensus system so that people are agreeing on what order things are coming in so that you can build things like Finance on top of that this was a hard technical challenge this is uh one of our earlier ideas this is a three levels uh sharding where you basically split up nodes into groups have individual groups to vote on individual things that happen it's a very complicated construction and one of the things that we've been forced to do ",
        "12": "since then is just uh try really hard to reduce the complexity right basically yeah try hard to like really make things very simple because we just know that you know it's something that takes two months two weeks to uh to write down a spec takes uh you know two years to develop and so if it takes six weeks to write down a spec it would take six years to develop and so we had to like really you know like push the complexity down make a lot of sacrifices to push the complex setting down and we ended up coming closer to the structure that we have today one of the interesting things about um just ethereum's technical progress is how similar the things that we talk about today are to the things that we talked about six years ago this was a slide from a blockchain conference um I forget exactly you know for example forget exactly where I believe in uh in Taipei where I basically talked about ",
        "13": "what some of the important problems in ethereum are and the the four I mentioned are pretty simple right privacy inside the safety smart contract safety and scalability and if you listen to me or you know like anyone else talk about what are ethereum's biggest problems today you you get basically the same answer right privacy gets at the safety sport contract safety and scalability so the challenges are the same as the challenges were six years ago but at the same time what is I think is interesting is sorry some of the uh you know some of the progress that has been made since uh by 2017 right so 2018 um you know the the beacon chain right this is when we work on ethereum is proof of stake really switched from research to development and this is where I mean ",
        "14": "like we had this big Workshop in Taipei we and then we later had another Workshop in Berlin we really came together we agreed on approximately what would be the design of ethereum proof of stake and we switched to actually working on building it um so this is in early diagram I'm describing what the beacon chain well proof of stake in sharding would look like this is actually not what it looks like today right what it looks like today is even simpler than this right so we've been continuing to push complexity down more and more as much as we could but this is what it looked like in 2018. now in 2023 the status quo of ethereum from a usage perspective right is basically that in many places there's a few people who are using crypto and people who are using it are using it to do things like trading digital monkeys in many other other countries very many people are using it but a lot of the time they're using centralized exchanges ",
        "15": "right there are many countries around the world where for example um you know there's more than 10 percent of the population holds cryptocurrency right like you hear statistics like this from places like you know Argentina turkey Nigeria you know Ukraine um like many countries that have different kinds of complicated political or currency situations and in those places like being able to have this alternative means of transacting and uh you know holding savings is just a lifesaver for people right and it's valuable for people already but the challenge is that when you look at like how these people actually use um you know the cryptocurrencies they're always going through essentialized exchanges and centralized exchanges can be good and they can be convenient but as we found out last year centralized exchanges often break so one of the ways that I see the challenge is basically in trying to find ways get ",
        "16": "to the point where we can actually have more people using you know not just cryptocurrency but like actually using the blockchain and like actually benefiting from minook the openness and the kind of global permissionless and decentralized nature of the technology so problems are the same as today but there has also been a lot of progress right so if we look at privacy for example in uh 2017 privacy was just a technical challenge right basically yeah there was this uh there's this new type of cryptography called a ZK Snorks right and uh also called zero knowledge perfs and what the swatsu do is it basically lets you create a cryptographic proof that proves certain like any mathematical property like anything that can be computed on data that you have without revealing anything else about ",
        "17": "that data right and this was used first by zcash zcash is a privacy preserving cryptocurrency that launched in 2016 and zcash used zks and arcs in order to achieve privacy right how do you do this basically when you spend a coin in zcash instead of pointing to directly which coin it is ending you make a proof that proves that you are spending a coin that you have that has not yet been spent without revealing anything else about that coin right so you're proving exactly the statements that you need to prove to have a currency system that does not hyperinflate but everything else is being kept private and back in 2017 the challenge was just importing the ability to use that technology onto ethereum um rely on a very complicated piece of math called elliptic curve pairings and the in the Byzantium hard Fork we basically ",
        "18": "added some what are called pre-compiles that well basically a kind of off code that let you use uh pairings ins like verify pairings inside of ethereum and so using smart contracts you could actually build an application on top of ethereum that has the same kind of privacy preserving logic that was 2017. in 2023 the status quo technologically is a very Advanced right there are very Advanced zika sonar libraries development environments tools protocols you know we have Planck Halo 2 flonky to um starknet air Cairo just like this big long list of I mean like really fun and fascinating Technologies but privacy actually hit a different kind of bottleneck which is uh like basically yeah legal issues and issues around like ",
        "19": "coins coming out of these systems getting a getting accepted by The Wider ecosystem right so there have been legal issues around tornado cash which is basically you can think of it as a a clone of zcash that sits on top of ethereum like basically just because uh you know like hackers ended up ended up using it a lot and as a result of this there has been work coming out on a concept called proof of Innocence which is basically what proof of Innocence lets you do is it lets you prove that your coins that came through a privacy system also did not come from one of the hackers right so you're proving that proving that you're not one of the hackers without proving any without completely revealing where your coins came from and actually there's a paper coming out about this idea soon there's already several implementations from chain way and some other companies so like basically there's uh a lot of this like work in the details on like trying to modify these these privacy systems to ",
        "20": "to increase the chance to like if you actually use one of these privacy systems and then you go and deposit those coins in an exchange then the exchange like actually will accept those coins and will not like get maximally suspicious of you um also zika stock verification verification making it cheaper right it costs about 400 000 gas to verify a proof we want to make verifying proofs cheaper part of that is way or two is part of that is that is aggregation protocols so the difference between 2017 and 2023 is that in 2017 we were just trying to like make the basic building blocks work right in 2023 the building blocks work but we're really the focus is on optimizing those building blocks and on like doing a bunch of this more complicated work on trying to like make it fit in together with the mainstream world consensus safety in 2017 we were basically just finishing the research ",
        "21": "part of the proof of stake development process and we were just starting development in 2023 ethereum has fully switched over to proof of stake we've become a fully fully proof of stake system but the challenges have to do with increa reducing the complexity of the protocol improving the security of the pro of the protocol addressing centralization concerns or making it easier for people to stake making um a concept called PBS that makes it again easier to stake because you don't have to run complicated algorithms to optimize how much revenue you make smart contract safety I feel like smart contract safety has kind of maybe Advanced the least out of all four of these right because in 2017 we we were only one year after the Dow hack right who remembers the Dow hack here good it's uh basically I'm gonna look very one of the very first um big Dows this was a smart contracts ",
        "22": "that controlled about 150 million dollars and used it as an and was intended to be an investment fund it got hacked and uh basically the hacker actually tried to get away with quite a lot of money but then actually yeah ethereum ended up forking for like to uh like basically yeah return the money to the to the Dallas original owners um and so that was the only time anything like that happened in this area and so back in 2017 this memory was like still fresh in everyone's minds and everyone was like very worried about that this this kind of security and so people were like working um you know like hard on improving the security of the programming language making contracts safer making everything safer um and in 2023 like a lot of that work has succeeded and I think the amount of hacking happening has quietly reduced and when it hasn't reduced it's because ",
        "23": "people try to build things that are 20 times more complicated right if you're building something today which is not 20 times more complicated than what people were building in 2016. you're generally actually quite safe right there have been lots of lots of systems that have survived for years without being hacked and I think that's uh you know a very impressive accomplishment there's other kinds of safety that have been improved so in a few months after the Dow Fork there was something called the Shanghai dos attacks where basically an attacker took advantage of a lot of bugs within the ethereum protocol itself that made it possible to send transactions that basically slowed the entire chain down and we just like worked for months like base basically releasing an update every day and you know if the hacker kept finding a new bug every day like basically fighting against and finding all of these bugs and eventually after four years we you know there were a series of different changes and improvements then eip2929 also a lot of ",
        "24": "improvements to the Geth code base however right the guest developers have done some really amazing work and at the end of this like a lot of those security problems have basically actually kind of quietly been solved right like the thing with uh secure with security that's a little bit annoying is like when you switch from proof of work to proof of snake there is one big event right the merge the event happens and like you can have parties in Berlin to celebrate when you succeed in security there is no event because the whole point is that there is no event right but like it's sometimes importance to remember that um you know the event's not happening is good news right so I think you know if there have been real improvements there but there's still a lot of ongoing problems I mean scalability so back in 2017 sharding was just an idea we were also talking a lot about State channels and plasma these were these big Layer Two Solutions and then now after that ",
        "25": "around 2020 everyone switched over to roll ups and so today there's all of these different Roll-Ups there's ZK VMS um you know if there's optimistic uh Roll-Ups there's non-evm Roll-Ups these Roll-Ups are like actually starting to kind of take off their training wheels and become properly decentralized arbitrary made a major step toward that this year polygon made a major snap toward that this year there was ongoing work on like make decentralizing these systems further hardening the proof systems making them more secure making the proof systems faster so that with a ckvm instead of proving one block in five hours you could proof a block in 20 minutes and then maybe in the future it'll go down to two minutes maybe eventually 12 seconds so a lot of progress right and like the areas are still the same but there's just a you know a huge amount of gains that are being made on each one lots of other things too um so vocal ",
        "26": "trees um five or six years ago stateless clients were just an idea now Virgo trees are like a 10 person team that's written thousands of lines of code that's thought deeply about how to actually push this out onto ethereum it's like maybe one to two years away from actual implementation improvements to the evm evm max evm simplification okay with abstraction account abstraction is like this really big one right there like everyone who supports account abstraction has a different reason why they support account abstraction and I think the reason why is because account abstraction is like inherently this extremely flexible thing right the goal of account abstraction is to basically say instead of having accounts that are controlled by a key you have accounts that are controlled by a computer program if you have an account that's controlled by a computer program users can have different kinds of logic for how those transactions get approved right so instead of having one key you can have ",
        "27": "three different Keys you can have five different keys where like some of them are controlled by other people you know you can do multi-factor authentication you can have keys that are stored in trusted Hardware modules that exist on you know like any modern phone and I mean like you can have more secure ways ways to authenticate to that you know you can use Hardware wallets and you can combine multiple Hardware wallets together right you just get a lot of these different options you could even do like really like things like you know potentially use an email account as a way to authenticate um you know yourself as a way to authenticate yourself into an ethereum address right and like using an email accounts to access an ethereum account it feels kind of pointless because it feels kind of like centralized right like what's the points but on the other hand like for new users an email account is something that they already have and for experienced users you can do multi-factor authentication ",
        "28": "and email can be like one of the things out of you know three or four that secure your wallet so a lot of progress being made in a lot of different ways right now getting back to Middle like reality and users right uh yeah one of the events that I always talk about was this uh trip to Argentina that I made back in 2021 where I was really impressed by like just how many people were did things we're like actually using cryptocurrency right I remember on Christmas day I was just walking outside and on Christmas Day most things are closed and so I just wanted to go and find a coffee shop the first coffee shop that I found the owner recognized me he had told me that he had a crypto wallet and I asked if he could if we could pay with if and he said yes and um ended up paying um actually I even used Arboretum to pay so like even on a layer two ",
        "29": "um so you know being very modern but there is a problem right you know he was not using the you know the blockchain he's you know he was using a binance account right and like I you know like like I appreciate the things that that monologue binance has done and just uh like making cryptocurrency accessible to people where if they did not have binance they would not have had any other option right and I think it's like it's good to have those Alternatives but at the same time like I think as an ecosystem the goal was to try to move to having less and less um you know like Central points of failure over time right and I think even binance agrees with this right like they've been getting more and more into a kind of more I mean like partially decentralized things over time as well and actually yeah it's interesting like a lot of these other um you know centralized exchange CEOs when I talk to them and I tell and like like I'm not even the one that has to tell them I think centralized exchanges suck they're the ones that tell me like hey we actually want to be more decentralized right and you know for like for me I'm ",
        "30": "scared of them having um you know like a billion dollars where that they can steal from their point of view they're terrified that they have a billion dollars some other people money other people's money that they can lose right so improving decentralization here I think is like really a victory for everyone right but the problem is that decentralized ways for people like this to hold their coins just do not exist yet right and like trying to really improve and make things better for people on chain is like one of the really big challenges right so basically yeah I mean can we make it viable for people in these in these positions to like really actually use the chain benefit from um yeah openness and uh and decentralization of Asia Global permission blockchain and can we get to a world where like in all of these areas of applications that like really people have been thinking about all the way since 2013. we get to ",
        "31": "a version that like actually provides benefits and also actually works for people so the technical work you know the whole time has been following a pretty consistent Direction which I think is fascinating I think the tools have changed right the tools have changed a lot ten years ago we were not even thinking about ZK snarks now we are um but the you know the goals are the same um now I think there's a lot more of a need to focus on like actual use and adoption and milk the solutions involve technical work but they're more distributed and they're more on different layers of the stack right so what this means is that like the ethereum foundation and the ethereum core development teams and the client teams are not like the only place to do extremely important stuff right like wallet companies are also a place to do extremely important stuff um build application developers are a place to do extremely important stuff I mean even like building Enterprise blockchain systems like this is a thing ",
        "32": "that people have tried to do for many years but I think if you build it as a validium like a layer 3 on top of ethereum then like there actually is a way to make that viable and to make that like actually work for uh people who are um you know like basically actually provide the benefits of decentralization but at the same time make it like actually possible for people to deploy things right so I think you know those are like some of the biggest changes that we've seen in ethereum over the last 10 years right basically just a yeah you know a long slow Journey from ethereum being an idea to or just a you know like having to actually deal with I'm gonna look 10 to 50 different uh challenges of uh getting this stuff uh you know like actually usable in the world and uh you know I hope over the next five years we're going to like end up actually solving most of these ",
        "33": "challenges so thank you [Applause] and I hope the students learn enough how to uh drive a new technology and move to uh influential usage now we have about like uh less than half an hour as usual for Q a uh protect me you understand here so you can have access to the uh my mm-hmm thank you any questions from [Music] you know okay that restaurant you say hello my question is uh actually how do you look at the internet ",
        "34": "[Music] liquid is the rain still around in the on the blockchain so do you think this is good for the development of issuing ecosystem because if we observe this phenomena in other and in other traditional financing money market when sometimes this says money or the value coin they stopped they stopped circulating within the blockchain it could cause some issues for the ecosystems so what do you think yeah I I actually don't think that it's like a big deal if I you know like even 80 or 90 percent of the eth ends up getting staked I think it's uh because like eth is not a currency in the same way that a dollar is a currency for example right and so like it's a it's an asset that has different kinds of uh properties and I expect that over ",
        "35": "time we'll find more and more ways to simultaneously use if both for staking and as uh collateral and other other kinds of applications I'm figuring out how to do that well is a challenge but I think it is something that we will move closer and closer to I mean I think finding ways to continue making sure that's taking stays decentralized even as ethereum is taking ends up uh I mean like being something that almost every ethereum user does is uh like or at least a very large portion of ethereum users do is definitely a challenge but it's uh I mean it is one that lots of people are really working on now uh thank you I actually have a second uh a question sorry about that it's really about the things you communicate more with in the US and sometimes in the Europe you have exchange ideas with the different Western Capital so do you ",
        "36": "think from their perspective uh will they in the future promote other change development such as arbitrine or optimism or even other layer ones to compete with ethering so what do you think uh on that point I mean sorry I feel like I don't understand the question well like when you say Western like what kinds of actors are you talking about uh it's more like the Western Way Seas for this is coinbase Ventures yeah I mean I feel like I feel like VCS have been like sort of pushing everything almost since the beginning right like there's uh you know like back in 2018 like right you know there was eos and then back in I'm in like 2014 and 15 you know there was  years and all of these systems so I feel like yeah like like Western Capital has been like trying to get into like every yeah every layer one pretty ",
        "37": "much since um you know at the the beginning of like the idea that you could make new layer ones um so I don't really expect changes in that regard I definitely think that there is a limits to how much they can accomplish right because like as we've seen like they've tried this kind of like shock and awe Playbook of you know like throwing coordinating and throwing huge amounts of money toward a particular ecosystem in like trying to be a king maker and with that's like I feel like we did we've realized that like that's actually much less effective in crypto than it is in other places right like I think four in the ecosystem to really succeed it needs to have a strong community and that's not something that Capital actors are really capable of creating like they just uh you know I don't have as much experience in that so I think the leader twos and also you know like the other earlier ones that will succeed are more likely to be the ones that like do a good job on on that angle and yeah like making ",
        "38": "e-community is uh good is hard and it's not something that can be replicated oh thank you because on social media audience okay okay sorry about that yeah so this lady okay hmm yeah hi um hello vitalik I am Thea from Fudan and blockchain and my question is that after the uh wow spread adoption of eth especially after post maybe in the future how we may deal with a significant wealth inequality problem sorry which how do I deal with which problem um the significant wealth inequality problem issue thank you the ",
        "39": "there's like an aspect of the of the problem that we can deal with and in aspects that we can't right the aspect that we can is basically that like these are open ecosystems and anyone from the world can kind of come into them and so inequality that exists outside of ethereum is just inevitably going to I mean I'll become part of the of the inequality yet in ethereum and it's like difficult to change the protocol in a way that affects wealth distributions right like the so the decisions that we've already made for example right is if you look at the current eth Supply the eth supply comes from like basically three different sources right like there was the original pre-mine that was given to you know like the foundation and core developers which was 10 then there was the sale which is fifty percent and then there's the amount that was mined which is another forty percent right and so there are like three different kinds of people ",
        "40": "over the course of um you know like seven years that had an opportunity to like become part of the initial youth distribution right and like that did work better for us than like for example what a lot of other projects are doing where all that they do is they just like raise money from a VC fund because when they do that they um you know often end up with like 12 people having 45 of the token Supply right and so I think it's uh like it's easy to do a lot worse than ethereum has done and it's uh like and I think we're lucky at the time in Milwaukee ethereum has done worse in terms of like what things can be further done to improve things from today I think like manipulating the yeah you know like the East holding Supply directly is hard but I think what is more practical is finding ways for diff more in different groups of people to succeed in the ecosystem right and the ethereum foundation like has a big Focus ",
        "41": "I think on like helping people I mean like find ways to grow and succeed even if they yeah don't have access to the best VC firms uh people from you know like very geographically distributed regions um and uh you know like people who are not kind of part of the ATM and like initial uh core developer and research communities and continuing to improve those programs and continuing to just like make it easier for people who are who were not part of the kind of core elite ethereum Community to build things and you know become a significant part of the ecosystem is probably the best that we can do today and that's something that we're trying to improve for your answering specifically got some questions from that side yes I I um I have a question um I'm b-man from absd and I want to ask ",
        "42": "some questions about the security of SDK circuit because we are we can see that there are a lot of 3K projects launching their midnet like school and education Etc but we find it really hard to audit CK circuit and I think that it's a really important issue because I I saw your Twitter once because you wrote about the ZK security what do you think about the coming launch of the mainnet and how do we deal with the security of CK circuit yeah I think I mean for ZK for zke VMS I think uh what we need what the best thing in the short term um is what I call multi-provers right basically instead of relying on one proof system you're rely on at least two proof systems and then if we want you can have a governance mechanism where ",
        "43": "basically if the proof systems disagree then the governance can decide which one of the two it's uh accept as the correct one and if you do that then like basically that makes you secure a much more secure against the possibility that like one of the systems has a bug right because like the two of them it's very unlikely the two proof systems will have a bug that causes them to disagree in the in the exact or the or that causes them to give the wrong answer in the exact same way right so that's uh I think the best thing in the short term and I know that some of the Roll-Ups are already going in this direction like I know optimism already has a multi-prover system in its roadmap I believe Linnea I mean they at least told me something about going in a similar Direction I believe actually their next version is going in that direction so that's short to medium term in the longer term I think there is also an option of like trying to enshrine a ZK ",
        "44": "evm verification into the protocol and that's obviously a much more complicated challenge but like if we do that then that would reduce the number of lines of code that people have to write themselves and it would like put more things into a kind of under the protocol and so that would improve things more I think in the long term but like we're obviously not quite there yet thank you yes yeah thank you nice to meet you uh with Italian I'm so exciting face to face and I have a question I have seen from new death um uh what would you think is the problem of the Israel mistaking ecosystem or LSD ",
        "45": "and uh I I have no there's a platform reflexor reflector you have introduced it and how can uh it uh solve the problem of good question yeah I think there was like a short-term problem and a long-term problem here right like the short-term problem is that the you know like liquid staking tokens basically create this centralization risk because uh you know like if one liquid seeking platform gets too large then like that it starts um you know gaining the a lot of abilities to like interfere with the ethereum chain in different ways um so in the short term I think the best that we can do is encourage people like more of a diversity of these projects to exist right so like one of the ideas that I had is for like Rye which is an ethereum based stable coin to use like ",
        "46": "like basically like smaller um liquid staking tokens so things other than Widow with the goal of like trying to distribute staking like more between different projects um so that's uh something that so basically like in the short term I think the BET like one of the things that we'll have to do is just try to do everything that we can to have like a balance between more between some of these projects but I think the long-term problem is like really yeah understanding what is uh and what is a stable equilibrium for staking that continues to be decentralized and one of the big challenges there is basically that Solo's taking is hard right like most people don't solo stake for various reasons like they don't have 32 eth or it's too technically hard to run a node running a node requires I mean look too many resources it requires too much technical work it's not safe enough because you can't use it with a cold ",
        "47": "wallet right like all these different reasons and we can try to improve solo staking more that's one path that's uh One path that we can take or we can possibly try to look for some other model right so yeah I think if we can try to look for some look for some some other model then it becomes uh easier to um and put it like yeah you know like if we find some other model then like maybe you know like in the long term we could create an ecosystem that doesn't like have these centralization pressures so that it to the same extent right so I definitely agree that this is like a top three um you know research challenge for ethereum going into the next five years and but you know there was a lot of people that are working on it right now thank you okay so okay ",
        "48": "hi there how are you good I have a I have a pretty tricky one here so only answer whatever your comfort was okay trying to get in this sector they're bringing a lot of topics like uh original blockchain so where do you think this is going and what's the you know like a whole picture on on the whole black blockchain yeah I mean I'm I'm bearish on the whole regional blockchain thing and I think the reason why is because people have tried for years and they have not gotten anywhere right like people have tried making um you know local blockchains Consortium blockchains like blockchain public blockchains that are organized around a particular country and all of these systems they just always end up having a very hard time getting adoption right either because they're too small to like ",
        "49": "really get a community or because uh you know it's easy for them to attract the first five people but then it's harder for them to expand beyond that because anyone coming in after that sees an ecosystem that's like already dominated by whoever the first five people are right and so for oh like Enterprise use cases I'm much more bullish on validiums and layer threes and like basically because for if you use those kinds of systems the amount of like re-engineering that you have to do as much less right like from in just Enterprise I.T perspective if you're going to move your application onto a Consortium blockchain the amount of technical work is like eighty percent as much as the work of just moving it on to ethereum right now the cost is lower but the amounts of like initial technical work is almost the same right but at this so it's like I think uh making like custom Enterprise blockchains or Regional blockchains or any of those things like to me it's like you only get you know like 20 of the ",
        "50": "cost savings but and only 20 of the benefit of decentralization but if you make something like if you take this other approach of making a validium what you're basically telling the Enterprise I.T people is you can keep your server you can keep your server running the same code as it is today but we're going to add an extra Daemon that can talk to the database that can make Merkle Roots the hashes of the database that can make zero knowledge proofs of the code that you're running to update the database and then publish that those hashes and publish those proofs onto ethereum right so they're not changing existing code you're just adding new code that sits beside existing code that they already have and I like I think this actually gives like at least 50 percent of what people want out of decentralization if these hashes and proofs go on something like ethereum like a public blockchain but like instead of being 80 of the like work in re-engineering it becomes like maybe 20 of the work in re-engineering ",
        "51": "right so like this is why I believe that kind of approach is like actually better and more likely to succeed and like the reason why it hasn't succeeded yet is because the technology has basically not existed in a good enough form until like literally one year ago so I'm I'm optimistic we'll see more of those in many spaces in the next five years somewhere maybe you can and actually I might propose some questions about like AI you know that people are very curious about how Ai and Webster can collaborate together but like AI is more about like this productivity or web3 is more about like this production relationships and you mentioned that we have to focus more on these actual usages and in terms of like these labor markets especially like these freelancer markets like we see this AI the collaboration between human ",
        "52": "and AI will revolutionize how are we organize these structures of these labor markets and like on these products like World coin observes as some components of how we can revolutionize this labor market the future type of it so how do you see the chances and what other things that these blockchain Technologies can foster the positive changes of of this labor market thank you yeah I mean I think the biggest practical positive change that blockchains can do to the labor market is just making the international economy a lower friction right like this is uh something that they do already right like there's a lot of like for example nft artists in Africa or just like remote workers in um you know like southeast Asia or India that you know like make money like basically by working for Western companies and you know crypto makes it ",
        "53": "much easier for that money to actually flow right and I think you know like in the future we'll have uh Milwaukee not just cryptocurrency to make the money flow more easily we might have like ZK verification tools to make the yeah you know to make it easier to identify like people you know like who has a better reputation so I think we'll see in a smart contract so you know make it easier to do many kinds of international business more securely and so I think you know like giving people in countries that are not well connected to the global system more of the same kinds of opportunities that people in existing rich countries have is probably the the biggest value out that blockchains could have there thanks so much popular the last question maybe uh someone in the back oh someone in the back okay okay hi um I'm so nervous hi my name is Coco with a leak I do a production system for ",
        "54": "several years and we met made in China before um yeah very glad to see you again I have questions about the defy you mentioned before um because I know D5 always seems like some problems nowadays what will be the future of the file looks like and what are the plans for a student system about the device system thank you yeah good question I mean I think the Community like the project the D5 projects that will survive in five years I think are going to be the D5 projects that are designed to survive for a long time right which is very different from the projects that are designed to grow quickly right like I think in the 2021 bubble we saw primarily projects that are designed to grow quickly and they did grow quickly but then half of them ended up blowing up and I mean the things that will survive for five years ",
        "55": "are the things that are like actually good at not blowing up right so I think the only way that D5 can succeed is by you know like having a greater focus on us just stability and making like not caring about like three percent Returns versus six percent returns but making sure people do not get minus 100 returns um and aside from that I think it's uh like the best thing that we'll we'll see is just uh continuing to make it easier for people to trade between assets how having exposure to different kinds of assets like not just currencies but also you know like stocks and real estates and real estate and other kinds of uh indices and and Investments um also kind of more novel applications including things like prediction markets and basically just uh you know like doubling down on like tools that we already have and that already work well and continuing to make them more usable ",
