        "0": "okay [Music] [Applause] yay [Applause] okay great so I'm apparently supposed to talk about digital States um so to start off um the way yeah that I tend to think about these things is that like new institutions are never going to be exact for like carbon copies of old ones right like they're never going to be exact like a better version of something that fits into the exact same box right so you know like when you have cars like cars don't perfectly replace horses there's things that horses can't do that cars don't do there's things that cars do that horses don't do you know there's a lot of differences between them um and when we talk about even like the internet replacing telephones or like the internet or the internet replacing ",
        "1": "like some aspects of in-person communication right like it's it's not about creating a new thing that is exact like that is to like the old thing except it's just better because like you know you you add this like piece of magic pixie dust and you know the like one particular aspect of it becomes 37 better for whatever reason like it often does end up changing like how we actually relate to like what fundamental problems that we're trying to solve right so when we talk about like the digital State like I even find it less interesting to ask the question of say yeah you know what can City governments do to become more digital or what can National governments do to become more digital or you know how can we coordinate um 10 000 people to go to the same location in the middle of a in the middle of a desert in Nevada and hopefully like actually create a new city with fancy blockchain quadratic stuff that actually works well um I like all of those questions are ",
        "2": "interesting um but prefer to kind of step back and just think about this from the point of view of like what are we trying to accomplish and you know why are we even having having this conversation and of what are the tools that we have and how do we kind of start to narrow the gap between the tools and the results right so I think the um most um fascinating thing about at least like this particular ethereum Community is that it just has this lovely combination of a whole bunch of like very positive cultures that I like right um so the first I read a very positive culture aspect that I like is just the fact that this Esa culture that is uh very interested in ideas like creating new institutions creating new ways for people to cooperate creating new governance structures um even creating new communication structures thinking about relationships between um communication and governance and like actually you know using things like ",
        "3": "blockchains and cryptography and incentives and tools and putting them together into these different like Arrangements where you know hopefully we'll build something that allows us to work allows us to work together on something better in some way um so that's the first thing that I like the second thing that I like is uh there is a uh I mean at least I think very Cooperative aspects to the community um like ever like everyone here is working together everyone here is kind of aligned on this uh set of several different many different Visions but still like fairly aligned Visions on just how to actually turn all of this into uh some kind of a better world um and I mean we even see like a lot of very positive interactions uh between the crypto community and institutions right like so the governor Jared Polis spoke here there's uh plenty of other people from um you know local government for many other kind many other institutions that are here what was that ",
        "4": "Wyoming wyomingdale yay Wyoming Wyoming is okay yeah I mean it was actually I was going to mention I mean I think the wyomingdale was like actually great and it's like one of the in like in my opinion the wyomingdale law actually is one of the best um examples so far of like governments doing something like something that like goes beyond like just um not like not breaking the industry that is actually like really helpful uh helpful to the the crypto spaces ability to thrive right because like what it basically is is I mean it's like government passes a law and it basically gives Dows this new superpower right like they can incorporate and they can and they can now legally own property and they can like actually legally do things and act as legal entities like that's probably one of the most powerful like kind of bridges between the crypto world and the ends of the traditional world that we ",
        "5": "have right and so because of that things like City Jail can exist because of that plenty of other projects can exist right so that's amazing um so I guess okay in Colorado and while filming there seems to be this little lovely Spirit of collaboration between the crypto community and um you know governments and many other kinds of Institutions so this is good right and the year so then the question is well okay so there's people in the the crypto community and there's people in existing institutions that are interested in these goals of using these new technologies to help people uh cooperate better um to you know create more open more free and more fair and more transparent forms of cooperation um and how do we actually take that energy and like what kinds of specific things can we work on in order to actually start to like you get closer to those kinds of outcomes now the reason why I kind of phrase things in this way is that it doesn't matter as much who ",
        "6": "does it right like so for example um you know if the state of Colorado like does something that enables some kind of some kind of crypto support across the stage it doesn't matter which then you know that's one way of doing it but what if instead the state of Colorado creates some kind of law that makes it easier for independent groups to spit out to whether it's Dallas whether it's local governments whether it's something else to the basic week work together themselves to achieve that same outcome and you end up having the same result right so sometimes I think like there is this solution of like taking existing um institutions and kind of pushing them in this direction and then there's sometimes there's this approach of this kind of more bottom-up approach right where you start with a small scale but something that's kind of purely crypto and purely digital and you do some experiments and some of those experiments fail some of those work and you scale it up from there and these New Paths are not opposing right like ",
        "7": "sometimes people think of these two paths or not as opposing I don't actually think that they are opposing um I actually think um that you know often they can complement each other um so often uh the you know as a wyomingdale law is um excellent example there right institutions can do something where once they do it from their institution the EGA institution doesn't need to do anything else and it actually creates space for it of the bottom-up community it's a and do all of this work and actually make all the all of the amazing progress happen right so I think that's like one um definitely great path to take um other paths to uh take would be obviously um you know starting from the ins from the institution and then kind of adding pieces on top right so at the end of last year I wrote this article on City coins and you know City coins are this kind of concept that people have been starting to think about and like there's this idea of you know can we create ",
        "8": "coins that are attached to cities somehow and could potentially introducing City coins actually like fixed incentives and improve local governance and there are some interesting um things that you can do there right so like how can you create economic alignments between people in a city and the whole city like I think the traditional uh like way of doing this tends to be about encouraging like basically property ownership and land ownership and you know everyone must own a house and uh you know if you don't own a house and you and you love your avocado toast you're a bad person I know I love my avocado toasts um so but you know the reality is that like how is this or non-fungible um houses are you're either a renter and you're negatively exposed to your community or you're a buyer and you're just massively Overexposed to your community and the reality is that they're both irresponsible um how then you know houses are not they do not create economic alignment with the entire city they create economic ",
        "9": "alignments with a very small portion of a city and often um to the in in ways that create conflict with the rest of the city right so you know people often are like hey you know we want more development we want more great stuff but like not in my backyard right so the the idea of like can we create cities that have more economic alignment inside them and can we come up with techniques other than like individuals owning specific pieces of property I think it's a really good idea and it's an idea that like we don't know exactly the correct way to implement that idea um but you know there's a room for a lot of good experiments um and uh you know I guess this category of City coins would be one thing that we call those experiments so one right so City now City coins are just like one um example of like a thing that can be done but then there is the question of like who does it right and ",
        "10": "here again um this is uh like the there can actually be a lot of different answers right so like Miami coin for example is like this interesting project on one end of the spectrum where they basically say like okay this is basically just a community project um and it starts as a community project and it doesn't have any kind of direct connection to the city governments like you don't actually have like City defined legal rights as a result of it but you know it's gotten some support from the government um and you know maybe over time the coin's role might change who knows um so that's one way of doing it another way of doing it would be like for the city itself to actually create the coin so you know which of those approaches you take could you take some approach in between um you know it depends on the situation um but in in general General like if you are a city government and we want something like that to exist then like both of those routes do exist right like one of the things that you can do is you ",
        "11": "can do it yourself and one of the things that you can do is you can create the environment that makes it possible for other people in the community to basically do all the work for you right because there are lots of people in the community and there are lots of people that are very willing and very excited to do these kinds of interesting things and really Empower people but like in order for that to happen you know you actually do need to like somehow create some create a framework that is supportive of them there are Frameworks that are supportive of people there are Frameworks that are kind of like actively I guess anti-supportive of people right so you know legal Frameworks that for example make it easier to launch a token the the less your token promises people like in some ways that's actively antisupportive right and like coming up with uh you know structures that are better and coming up with like say ways to have for people to launch tokens where you ",
        "12": "actually have like that are more friendly to more friendly to the project the more aligned its incentives are this is like the sort of thing where you know we do need to kind of lots of people to work together to actually make it happen um and it is the sort of thing um that uh like it's great where it's great that we actually have lots of different kinds of people all in a room and where people have all of these different like interests and perspectives and can actually start working together um so that is and you know that is only one example right so you know there's plenty of other examples as well um so if we take like let's say yeah so the concept of uh you know this blockchain like Dao governance in general right and there there's this question of like how do we actually create like these Dao based structures that actually like do something in the main in in the mainstream somewhere right I think uh ",
        "13": "you know obviously a lot of people here are working on Dallas and I feel like a lot of people here are working on doubt governance um there are plenty of ways of improving Dow governance so the way that many Dows are governed today coin voting I've written about this many times coin voting is just terrible um now okay wait wait I get collapsed we're just saying coin voting is terrible [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] um [Applause] uh coin voting is good okay good good this is uh see if okay maybe I should just like come up with a list of things and come up with a list of judgments and like randomly shuffle them and see what the response is um but okay if uh you know if let's see I should restart yeah so like I said you know so there's lots of things that we can that we can do to kind of bring you ",
        "14": "know improve uh blockchain so like for example if we want to like if we want to like really scale blockchains up I think you know sometimes we do have to make some compromises for decentralization and do some data center scaling collab for data center scaling you're not supposed to clap for data center scaling Okay so exactly decentralization no data centers unless Camilo okay if the data centers are generating zks and arcs and I can verify the ZK Stark on my phone then fine So speaking of UK's darks actually you know we talked about when we talked about this kind of concept of of like blockchain voting and this is one of those topics that I think is that like uh very interesting and I think it's actually it's like one of the natural kind of synergies between like ",
        "15": "cryptographic technology in general and a lot of the kind of governance Ambitions that people have but in some ways this is like one of the most challenging things to do well right and the basically the reason is that like on the one hand I think in general we do need to have like like there is a big opportunity I think to add much more of like what I would call kind of like good high bandwidth democracy um and today we have we have a lot of uh low bandwidth democracy right like you know you cast a ballot once every four years um so low bandwidth you know one bit of information every four years we have lots of high bandwidth things that are not democracy we have one lots of high bandwidth markets for example we also have lots of low security high bandwidth democracy voting on social media right you know someone makes a tweet it gets uh you know it gets 50 000 likes 50 000 retweets in two minutes well maybe it's actually one guy controlling all of them ",
        "16": "and it's a bot and you have no idea right so the challenge is that there's just like there are we like there clearly is this big need for kind of what a high bandwidth democracy in general um and there are already a lot of these applications that are providing high bandwidth democracy but they just tend to have very crappy security I mean and so the question is like can we have kind of like higher security high bandwidth democracy um and this is one of those things that I like I actually think potentially some kind of combination of cryptography and zero knowledge proofs and encryption action we can provide right like you do I think you do need all of the Technologies so like you need the encryption to make sure that nobody can see the votes they need zero knowledge proofs to make sure that the votes are being counted correctly um you need blockchains to make sure that whoever's counting the votes is not censoring anyone so we actually do need all of the pieces to come together right ",
        "17": "and you actually can create something with some pretty strong properties and there are even projects you know being kind of homegrown within the ethereum space that are trying to kind of make things like this possible but in order to um like in order for this to really work like it has to really be done well right you know it has to be efficient it has to actually be secure it has to actually be privacy preserving um and in terms of like where to actually accomplish this I think like like I actually feel like focusing on a kind of national level votes is almost like the like the wrong place to start it's like the last thing you should do instead of the first thing right like I think in general Crypt like adding kind of crypto features to existing governments can sometimes the best way that tend to make it work is not to actually like add in like crypto modifications to things that already exist it's to build completely new things that have better properties that people ",
        "18": "we're going to appreciate because they make it possible to do things that are not possible today okay yeah um so you know what this is what this is a big part of why like for example I'm a big fan of quadratic funding right and I think quadratic funding is that even something that could easily be applied at the government level right like you know or at the you know state level at the city level at many kinds of political levels there are many kinds of local public goods and it might you know people do have like all sorts of kind of this widely distributed information about like what kinds of these public goods they actually find valuable I mean and so if we want to actually kind of gather together this kind of information then you know we do want something that's high bandwidth we do want something where um if people actually where people can participate at actual at a reasonable frequency and dude we also do want something that's secure right so you know if we come up with ",
        "19": "some kind like some fully decent like decentralized a blockchain based quadratic funding platform that provides all of the security and the pro and the Privacy guarantee is that a governance system needs to have to be resistance to things like say bribery attacks this could actually be something really valuable right and if something like this gets built then you know potentially you could just get adopted so now this in some ways like it doesn't like a lot of this stuff doesn't even need to kind of wait for um you know big for big institutions right in some ways like one of the way or the the watch it's based all by itself is powerful right and the watch it's based all by itself you know it can build things and the blockchain space by itself can do demonstrations and you know even git coin grants by itself I think has been just an amazing demonstration you know I have like 12 rounds of quadratic funding supporting importance public goods in the ethereum ecosystem we've had a lot ",
        "20": "of chances to see like what it looks like you know tens of thousands of participants what kinds of things it's great at what kind what kinds of things it's me it's um it misses and it's actually in my opinion become like a a pretty significance and importance to all behind and how the ethereum ecosystem funds things that people in the ecosystem consider important um so that like um don't you know the more experiments and the more demonstrate like the the demonstrations like this that you can do like theoretically you know we could just like go and say we are just going to have a a gig when grants uh round for like say businesses in Boulder for example right like that is something that you know the community in Boulder can do um and I think it's interesting like this kind of um like actually like trying to like start materializing kind of like the online um the benefits of you know the online community and the offline world I think it's something that we actually can start doing more of it is something that the crypto space has kind of tried doing ",
        "21": "repeatedly on a number of occasions right so like for example back in 2013 I mean when we had Bitcoin and when you know we had Bitcoin payments and back when cryptocurrency transaction fees were still so low that being cheaper than with then PayPal was part of the sales pitch it will be again um no but you know Let's uh oh no I should have like come up with some uh some phrase by some famous military leader that had to retreat from a country and promise to return but you know ethereum with five cent transaction fees we will be back and uh Roll-Ups are already making a huge amount of progress you know sharding is already making a huge amount of progress so you know it's not just words you know the uh the the soldiers are already under development um so but anyway like so back in those days when we did the uh when what people ",
        "22": "would actually try to like or figure out specific cities and convince like or specific districts and convince people in this like very large districts to just accept cryptocurrency or or I guess in that case except Bitcoin right because back then you know realistically Bitcoin maximalism kind of was correct and that every cryptocurrency except for Bitcoin wasn't that interesting back in 2013 but you know anyway it it actually in my opinion it was interesting you know it's something that can create local community um so now that scaling technology is actually are on the horizon it might actually make sense to kind of go back and start doing some more of this more of that sort of stuff right but when we do like that doesn't have to kind of limit itself to just things like convincing stores to accept eth for payments right like that could actually mean things like actually you know if doing quadratic funding rounds like basically saying you know hey you know we we as a community are going to organize like say a two million dollar matching pool and um you know people can go and actually ",
        "23": "like vote and kind of participate in the in the in the quadratic matching and we can actually see how that goes that's an experiments right like you can actually like start doing these things and if these things are successful then I think that you know they're going to be picked up on right so quadratic funding is like in my opinion one of those kind of like examples of what I would call high bandwidth democracy that has actually been I mean it like it definitely not perfect for everything but it but it has been good at kind of capturing some important niches that existing forms of funding are missing and so the other question is like where do you go beyond where do you go from there right you know there's all there's lots of ideas kind of different pieces of infrastructure that need to happen like there is payments there is this kind of concept of identity and reputation and the concept of identity and reputation already has been making a lot of progress right like I think people think about if you're like identity like ",
        "24": "ethereum identity in the wrong way or people think about kind of blockchain ID in the wrong way right and what I mean by this is like I believe in blockchain idea but I do not believe in blockchain ID platforms um so what I mean by this is like I think the version of ethereum based identity that's going to succeed is the version that is being implemented as we speak that has been happening over the last few years without anyone actually calling it that and the people that are trying to like do they do an entire stack themselves they're basically just creating kind of silos isolated from the ecosystem that are going to fail so what do I mean by like ethereum identity that we already have so we have ens right ethereum the ethereum name system so if you have an ethereum address then you know you can register an ens name and you already have something that people can use like kind of you basically have a decentralized username for the ethereum world um if then we have signed in with ethereum so you can use your ethereum your ethereum account whether or not you have an ens name to sign into services ",
        "25": "including centralized web services um so in these two composed with each other so for example if you go to chat.blockscan.com so etherscan made this a lovely chat application that actually like accept sign in with ethereum and you know if you have if you have an ethereum address you can sign in but everyone's going to see your name as like 0x blah blah blah for these quickly characters now if instead you have an ens name then people connect are going to actually see your account as being like your like your ens name as your username right so we already see synergies between those two things already then we have attestation so there's proof of humanity attestations there's just like whether or not your account sent a transaction it's like the simplest form of like blockchain based anti-spam you can possibly have there is um you know potentially like in the future whether or not you're running a validator there is whether or not you have a pope there's like what kind of Pope do you have so you know there is ",

        "49": "to shape Society in the way I think Society can be shaped by technology but a thick technology can also be shaped by culture um I can I could even give like very specific like very specific examples of this um so like one very subtle one is like let's take let's say psihub for example right like so Sai Hub you know this like online website where anyone can go and download scientific like scientific papers and like the whole thing is totally copyright infringing right and like in in many cases um and like it lets people get this stuff for free um despite the fact that the paperback you know there's this University publisher kind of like infrastructure that and copyrighted all this that really doesn't want you to so this exists for um for science favors but and it's very easy to use for science papers but it exists less effectively for same music for example right and one of the reasons why I think it exists um like less like the tools for doing this for scientific papers are so much stronger than this ",
        "50": "was for doing this for music is because there is a much like an even stronger social consensus that like like scientific papers really should all be open access and free and in reality you know there is a like like there isn't a like any like a good argument that like oh this should be restricted because like because the scientist needs to be paid because like well realistically like we know that there is plenty of like there are plenty of ways of paying them and like often the the revenue collected by this kind of University system doesn't end up actually all like going to support research that much right and like you know people can make those Arguments for like say music as well and you know people like the pirate parties have but like it is I think in general people believe that like the case is significantly stronger in four scientific papers and so as a result of like these moral views that people have like the technology for the tools for making scientific papers Open Access like basically by force like it is just ",
