        "1": "are 10 and binary counting okay so today I'm going to basically talk about a ton of aetherium 2.0 but um not just from a technical point of view but more from the point of view of why aetherium 2.0 what is a theorem 2.0 and kind of how we got here right so what is a theorem 2.0 first of all if the areum 2.0 is this kind of combination of a bunch of different features that we've been talking about for several years of researching for several years actively building for several years that are finally going to come together in two or the scope of one coherent whole and these features include proof of stake Casper scalability or sharding virtual machine ",
        "2": "improvements we want some improvements to cross channel a contract logic improvements the protocol economics and like really the list goes on and on and there is some power law distribution so lots of great stuff now how did we get here right so the road to proof of stake actually started way back in 2014 with this blog post that I published in January describing this algorithm called slasher which is introduced kind of the really most basic concepts in a lot of reverse take algorithms which is this idea that if you get caught doing something wrong that this can be proven and you can be penalized for it and this can how this can be used to increase security but at the time as you can see from the slide I believe that quote Salah sure is a useful construct to have in our war chest in case proof of stake mining become substantially more popular or a compelling reason to switch but we're not doing that yet so at the time it was not even clear yet that proof of ",
        "3": "stake is even the direction that we're going but as we know now over time that changed quite a lot so what happened in 2014 so first of all went through a bunch of kind of interesting and awarded ideas proof of proof of work was this kind of suggestion to try to improve scalability hub-and-spoke chains so basically you kind of have one chain in the middle and a bunch of chains on the edges now but this was a kind of very early scalability and sharding proposal that tried to improve scalability for local transactions but not for transactions that are Global's or not for transactions that jump from one chair to another hypercubes so basically except that you should have 12 dimensions instead of 3 so we can get more scale even more scalability what's up some spokes by going with hyper cubes now unfortunately for various reasons this ad ended up getting abandoned but some has a big ICO to make it work so happy someone's trying it out ",
        "4": "in 2014 there was still some progress right so there was this concept of weak subjectivity that we came up with which was this kind of semi formal security model that tries to capture the idea of under what conditions are proof of stake deposits and slashing and all of these concepts actually secure also I know we got more and more certain that algorithms which much with much stronger properties than the proof stake algorithms that existed at the time so things like pure coin and all of its derivatives were actually possible and kind of growing understanding that there was some kind of proof state scalability strategy that you could somehow Jews through random sampling but we had no idea how and we had a road map so there was this nice blog post from Vinny ruta in March 2015 where he outlines the four big stages of aetherium roadmap at the time Stage one frontier if you REM watching ",
        "5": "yay Stage two homestead which is kind of going from alpha to beta stage three metropolis which at the time was supposed to be about mist and user interfaces and improving user experience but since then the focus has kind of switched more to ahead of enable in strong cryptography but interface mortis toll for going forward in parallel and stage for serenity proof of stake so from now on we're not gonna call it a theorem 2.0 I also will refuse to use the word chest because I find an insanely lame we'll call it serenity so [Applause] after this came a bit of a winter so we had a bunch of different kind of abortive attempts at solving some of the core problems and perfect stakes some of the core problems and scalability researcher caspere quietly began Vlad kind of quietly began doing all of his work on tasks for CBC one of the first interesting ideas was this kind of idea ",
        "6": "consensus by bet where basically people would kind of bet on wishful walk becomes finalized next and then once more people down the block that itself becomes information that gets fed into other people's bets and so the idea is that you would have this kind of recursive formula or more and more people would then more and more strongly on a block edit on a block over time and after a logarithmic number of rounds everyone will be betting their entire money on the Block in that we called finality this is we actually took this idea really far we created an entire proof of concept for it and you can see it finalized that you can see here is a signature function I mean burns most of our time on this but then that end whole idea kind of ended up going away basically once we realized how to make kind of proper BFT inspired consensus actually work same length rent so this is the idea that instead of charging a big one-time fee for filling storage we would kind of charge fees ",
        "7": "over time so basically for every day or whatever block or whatever that some storage is a lot is filled you would have to kind of pay some amount of ether for it there is this one VIP number number 35 that I tried to call EAP 103 but really it was the IP number 35 because that was the issue number that takes precedence and this is one of the really early ideas that trying to kind of formalize this concept and we've had many iterations on the of how to implement scan rent maximally nicely since then there was also this scalability paper that we tried to do back in 2015 and this tried to kind of formalize the idea of kind of quadratic shortening super quadratic sharding but it was very complicated it had these kind of very complicated escalation games it had the a lot of them were kind of inspired by ideas of how how escalation works in court systems an ",
        "8": "analogy that I know Joseph with a philosopher really lost in use as well but we tried to use it for the base layer deep state reversions so basically if something goes wrong than potentially large portions of the state good and if get reverted even fairly far into the future so there was a bunch of complexity right now one of the fundamental problems that we couldn't quite capture but that we were I know have been slowly inching towards was this idea of the fisherman's dilemma it means this is a fundamentally and very fundamental concepts in shorting research that basically describes the big difference between scaling execution of state and scale and execution of programs versus scaling availability of data and the problem basically is that with an execution of programs you can have people commit to what the answer is and you can later kind of play a game and try to kind of binary search your weights or who actually made a mistake and you can penalize everyone could be a ",
        "9": "mistake after the fact the problem with the availability is that whatever the game is you can cheat the game because you can just not publish the any data at all until the mechanism tries to check if you published it and only then do you publish just the data that the mechanism check for and this turns out to be a fairly large one a fairly large of the scalability algorithms and I wrote this a blog post if you want to search for it you can call a it's called a note on a racial coding nz8 availability that describes some of the issues in more detail but still this is one of the things that delayed us but even still we were happily making progress aetherium was moving forward we were on our way wait then this happened okay no more problems oh wait then this happened so the dow hacked the Gauss attacks all of that ended up delaying a lot of ",
        "10": "people's time and attention by potentially up to six months but even still work move forward you also moved forward the work on the virtual machine move forward and work on the end of alternatives things like EDM 1.5 moves forward and people were still continuing to kind of get a better and better idea of look basically what a more optimal blockchain algorithm would look like from many different angles so after this that we started making huge progress and very quickly right so during all of this time there were these difference as strands of research that we're going on and some of them around proof of stake and trying to do base layer consensus more efficiently some of them were around scalability and trying to short base where consensus some of them were around improving the efficiency of the virtual machine some of them were around things like abstraction that would allow people to use whatever signal ",
        "11": "honestly wanted for their accounts which could provide post quantum security it would make it easier to make privacy solutions among a bunch of other benefits protocol economic improvements and really all these things were still happening all the way through so at some point around the beginning of 2017 we finally we came up with this contest protocol that we gave the theory kind of unambitious name of a minimal slashing conditions and minimal slashing conditions was basically a kind of translation of PBMC style of traditional Byzantine consensus so the same sort of stuff that was pre done by a good way important to work going to stockmeyer and all those fate and all those wonderful people back in the 1980s but simplifying it and kind of carrying it forward into more of a blockchain context right so the idea basically basically is that in a blockchain you just have to keep on having these new ",
        "12": "blocks appear over time and you can give these nice kind of pipelining efficiencies by merging sequence numbers and viewers every time a new round starts you and admin get into the round you can also have the second kind of round of confirmation for one piece of data be the first round of confirmation for the next piece of data and you can really kind of get that extra amount of amount of efficiency and out of all of that so the first part was step was minimal swatching additions which had six slashing conditions then it went down before and finally about half a year later we ended up merging four pairs of commits and this gave us Casper the Friendly finality gadget Casper FFG so last year at Def Con I presented this new shorting design that basically kept the main chain and then Creon did sharding they all kind of layer to system on top of the existing main chain that would then kind of get upgraded to being the layer one once it gets solid enough from ",
        "13": "Vlad the Casper CBC paper the Casper FFG proof of concept so December 31st 2017 23:40 Bangkok time because we happen to be in Thailand at the time basically what happens here is we pretty much managed to nail down what the spec of a version of hybrid proof of stake would look like and this version of hybrid proof of stake would basically use the ideas from Kasparov FG use these a kind of traditional Byzantine fault tolerant consensus inspired ideas of how to do proof of stake on top of the existing proof of auction so this would be a mechanism that would allow us to get to hybrid proof of stake fairly quickly with actually a fairly minimal level of disruption to the existing blockchain and then the theory is that we will be able to upgrade to full proof of stake ",
        "14": "over time and we got very far along in this direction and there was a test that there were Python clients there there were messages going like between different bps and different servers and different computers and it got very far and at the same time we were making a lot of progress on sharding so we Hakeem continued working on the seanix back eventually we had this rich lead in Taipei in March and around here a lot of the ideas around how to implement a shorted watching seems seems to solidify seemed the solidified so in you and we made this kind of very difficult but I think in the long term really very beneficial decision which is that we said that hey over here we have a bunch of teams that are trying to implement hybrid proof of stake and they're trying to do the do ",
        "15": "the Kasper FFG thing build the Casper effigy implementation as a smart contract inside of the existing watch in make a few tweaks to the fortress role that over here we had a completely separate group that was trying to make a shorting system that was trying to make a validate or manager contracts and that was later renamed into a sharding manager contract on the main chain and that was trying to build a sharding system on top of that these groups were kind of not talking to each other too much then on the shorting side it eventually became clear that we would get much more efficiency by making the kind of core of the shorting system not be a contract on the proof of work chain but instead be its own proof of stake chain and because that way we could make validation much more efficient we did not have to deal with EDM overhead we did not have to deal with gas we would not have to deal with unpredictable proof of work block times who can make work times faster along with a whole bunch of other efficiencies and really realized hey ",
        "16": "we're working on proof of states here we're working on further states here why are we doing two separate proof of stake things again and so we decided to just merge the two together this did end up kind of nullifying a lot of work like team before but what it meant is that instead of having working on these two separate implementations we were working together on this one spec this one protocol that would get us the benefits of Casper group of steak and sharding essentially at the same time right so basically instead of trying to go to go to it like to go to one destination then go to other destination than leader on have the massive work of figuring out how to merge the two we would just make a path which would take a little longer at the beginning but the place that it gets to it actually ins a proof of stake and sharded watching with the properties that we're looking for [Applause] ",
        "17": "so in the meantime we spent a lot of time arguing about for choice rules these we ended up kind of getting closer and closer and deeper into realizing that fortress rules based on ghost the agreed II heaviest observed sub-tree algorithm that was originally intended for proof of work but repurposed by us for proof of stake made a huge amount of sense we were Justin started doing research on verifiable delay functions we had this workshop at Stanford and we made a lot of progress I verifiable delay functions there and justin is still cooperating with a lot of researchers from there more ideas on how to do abstraction how to do this idea where individual users can choose their own signature algorithms for their accounts more ideas on rent which we decided to rename to storage maintenance fees for political reasons and research so there is a lot ",
        "18": "of work on cross card transactions so for example there is a suppose I made on cross chart contract ranking which kind of generalizes the traditional distributed systems concept of walking into something that makes sense in this kind of a series of cross short contexts also wrote this paper on resource pricing which includes ideas about a kind of optimized and is that much more efficient fee market along with storage me how to do storage maintenance this and why and the different trade-offs between different ways of setting them and PC here at Vittorio wrote this post on doing synchronous wash across chart transactions so and of course in the meantime Casper a CBC research also expanded into kind of Casper CBC's own brand of Chardon which is totally not called Florida absolutely hates that sir so development ",
        "19": "right so be there's one of the kind of key strategies that we tried to really push forward in the etherium 2.0 path is the idea of creative multi-client a centralized development and this wasn't just a kind of because we have an ideological belief in decentralization this was also a kind of very pragmatic strategy to like basically had your bet first of all hedge your bets against the possibility that anyone software development team would not perform well second because we already have plenty of experience from the shanghai das attacks of how in there are midpoint ii of cases where if one client has a bug having other clients being available allows the network to continue running better also wanting to kind of make the end of the development ecosystem less dependent on ",
        "20": "the foundation itself so the client that the etherion foundation works on is actually the pipeline client and so it's in it has plenty of use cases but the in Python just as a language has inherent performance limitations and so there's always going to be an incentive to try running the stuff built by the wonderful folks that prismatic and white house and status and Pegasus and all the other teams that are popping popping up seemingly everyone so soon something which is totally not going to be called Jasper serenity begins yay right so what is serenity right so first of all it's the fourth stage after a frontier and homestead and metropolis and where metropolis has broken down into by Santiam and Constantinople with Constantinople coming very soon as well and at some realization of all of these ",
        "21": "different strands of research that we have been spending all of our time on for the last four years right so this includes Caspar and not just hybrid Caspar 100% organic genuine pure Caspar sharding awasum and all of these other brand of protocol research ideas this is a young new blockchain for in the sense of being a data structure but it has this kind of a link to the existing proof of auction right so we be able to like the proof of State chain would be aware of the block ashes of the proof of or chain you would be able to move either from the proof of or chain into the into the river station so it's a new system but it's a connected system and the kind of long long term goal is that once this new system is stable enough then then basically all of the applications on the existing blockchain can be sort of folded into a contract ",
        "22": "from one shard of the new system that would kind of be an EDM interpreter written and he wasn't and not finalized but this seems to kind of roughly be where the road map is going at this point serenity is also the world computer out it's really as it's really meant to be and not a smartphone from 99 they can process 15 transactions per second and maybe potentially play snake and it's totally centralized and we hope that in many metrics it can be even more decentralized than today so for example as a beacon chain validator your storage requirements at this point seem like they will be under one gigabyte as compared to like something like 8 gigabytes of state storage today and the 1.8 terabytes that tools on the internet seems to think the etherium watching requires for some stupid reason expected phases so phase 0 we can change purse of steak and beacon chain proof of steak is actually is kind of the blockchain stock ",
        "23": "kind of hold any information right it's kind of like a dummy chain so all that you have is you have validators and these validators are executing and they're running the proof of steak algorithm so this is kind of like halfway between a test that in the main that it's not quite a test debt because you would be able to actually speak real ether and real rewards on it but it's also not quite a main net because it doesn't have applications and so if it breaks people are hopefully not going to cry too badly as they would as they did won the shanghai das attacks made everyone's i ce o--'s go slowly phase 1 shards as data chains so basically the idea is here is that this is where they're kind of shorting port turns on right so the dis here it's just it's a kind of simplified version that doesn't do shorting of state it does shorting of data so you can throw data on the chain you could try to make just do what's the execution engine yourself but really the simplest thing to use it ",
        "24": "for is data and and so if you wants the Dewey decentralized Twitter on a watch chain you'll now have a scalability to do this but you won't really have the kind of all of this data execution capability to build you know it's smart checked applications and all the really fancy complex stuff stays to enable state transitions and this includes enabling the virtual machine enabling a talents contracts ether you for moving between shards all of this cool stuff and phase 3 and beyond iterate improve add technology so expected features pure proof of stake faster time to synchronous confirmation so about 8 to 16 seconds now notice that because of how the a fork choice rule and the outcomes of the some signing mechanism works in the Vita chain one conformation in the beacon chain involves messages from hundreds of validators and so for all probabilistic points of view it's actually equivalent to hundreds of ",
        "25": "confirmations of say the etherium proof of or change right so you under a synchronous model you should be able to treat one block as being close to final economic finality and safety andre synchrony comes after 10 to 20 minutes and fast virtual machine execution you want some and the hopefully a thousand times higher scalability we will see for serenity innovation improvements in privacy and input so there has already been a lot of work done so for example in Byzantium we activated the pre compiles for elliptic curve operations in elliptic curve pairings and Barry White has been doing great work on building the layer 2 solutions to preserve privacy of point transfers voting reputation systems and all of this work could be carried over crossed short transactions semi private chains so the idea here is that if you wants to build some application where the data is kept ",
        "26": "private between a few users you can still dump all the data on the public chain but you would just dump it in an encrypted form or you can dump hashes of it use your knowledge first like your choice proof of steak improvements there's definitely a place in our heart and the roadmaps heart for Casper CBC when it becomes it becomes clear that it's no no that there is a kind of a version that makes sense from an overhead point of view for serenity innovation so at some points we have all we wants to when we do have a door open to kind of upgrade everything that starts so using Starks for signature aggregation for verifying original codes for data availability checks maybe eventually for checking correctness of state execution maybe stronger forms of cross your transactions faster single confirmations getting the conservation slime down from eight seconds even lower medium-term goals eventually stabilize ",
        "27": "at least there kind of functionality of layer one think about issuance think about fees agree more and more over time on kind of what specific guarantees people expect from the protocol and things that people expects that best features for the protocol to have for a long time on think about governance now what's next immediately so what happens before event of the deagle launch well first of all stabilizing the protocols back so for those who have been watching github.com slash aetherium / - people I know or so you point OA - backslash we master specs we can chain them see something like that the spec has been kind of moving fairly quickly fairly quickly but you know it will stabilize fairly soon continued development and testing there's something like each implementations of the etherium 2.0 protocol happening now cross client test nets so I believe a ",
        "28": "free and made estate made a statement that together she hopes to see you cross client work like really picking up in q1 next year I mean we'll see him that would be definitely nice to see a kind of test networking between two of limitations I mean honestly we're going to be nice to see a test step working between one implementation like really really so as I kind of quick history I'm aside right EGM etherium 1.0 development time between conception of the white paper and launch 19 months part of the reason why it took so long is because we tried to get kind of cross clients compatibility way before the spectrum and finish and so we had to agree test release test net await protocol changes agree test for retested await more protocol changes and we had about five cycles of this this time around we have the luxury of kind of learning from that Watson and we don't really need to kind of focus on cross flange accountability until we have something close to a ",
        "29": "robust can't release candidate to the spec but I think we're actually not that far for Berube's candidate of the spec at least for kind of limited portions that don't that don't include that state execution so we'll see him security audits who here thinks security audits are important like security audits are not important crucio thinks the world is so literally controlled by wizard men okay that's okay so more people from the third of a second that's good this year and then once we're done that launch a quiz here thanks for watching is not important okay who's here thinks that your favorite political candidate is literally a lizard man okay so launch there we go and that's basically you know a model of stone that we've all been waiting for that we've been working toward for the last five months four to five years and ",
