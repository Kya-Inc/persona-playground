        "1": "that can verify the change without holding any stages of themselves and then in the longer term this basically means that using ZKA EVMS on layer one right so that you'll be able to use a synops to verify the serial blood uh it's a Verge protocol simplification so starting off with the enu444 so their client says don't have to store the phone history but then also going in to try to simplify the protocol uh Banning self-destruct as one of the top emps right now and a few other things dealing with any of the dealing with centralization risks and discourage and ",
        "2": "again basically everything else including a tail distraction which is really powerful for a smart contract wallets including multi-safe wallets social recovery wallets won't want to see using different kinds of cryptography and lots of other things and this is the storage um so that's all that's what I want um I know too uh we've seen in our Roll-Ups right so in other big milestone is that Roll-Ups in this year are finally starting to hit this Milestone that I call stage one right so this is a set of Milestones that I get identified in this post I made on ethereum Physicians last year which was basically pushing Roll-Ups uh to try to like actually yeah you know have their proof systems whether it's optimistic or is the Easter or whatever else on chain and um you know basically not just people ",
        "3": "visits right because uh in our ecosystem we had a lot of things and colon solves lawyer twos but actually we are those 26. and at the time like basically all of the major Roll-Ups except for the non-edm ones like you know Fuel and uh lubric and a couple others that I missing were just helpful these things right they were working on group systems what they did not actually happen and polygon and you know as of the end of March actually again you know has their own system turned out they do still have a multi-sig but the multi-sig has a very high percentage with a variation independently distributed participants so it's uh it basically a huge number of people or like almost almost all of this group has to agree it and I guess it's not a huge group of people it's a three River but it's a diverse group of people ",
        "4": "and uh the great majority of them have to agree to kind of override what the VA what the code says right and they have plans for two and over time remove that mechanism as well uh and to other Roll-Ups are kind of following on pretty soon right so archrom I know is like I forget either they're at the solo there's this one by this point where they're very very close to it and then I don't know optimism and squirrel and uh Taiko and that all of those are continuing to work on this as well there's a team in the star core ecosystem Kakarot which is like if anyone to work on on Roll-Ups so ropes are finally kind of turning into you know really properly being real Roll-Ups which is amazing and uh no we're getting actual Mouse Milestones here with actual resistance on maintenance uh further work on privacy Solutions so there's that Aztec uh which is a continuous to improve you ",
        "5": "know Nocturne is um he stealth addresses more and more groups starting to appear social recovery wallets um margin has existed for years uh solo it is uh actually based on erc4037 so it's a very uh you know pushing to these standards compliant and to be a kind of drop-in replacement for better masks so the users like they don't get they're not just using it assays yeah a wallet for spending uh but actually yeah you know two tools it was here in interactions no Financial applications cyano with ethereum uh manova reset uh interest in what three social networks so a lot of things are happening on lawyer 2 as well but there is an important way in which these things are not like the March right so the word the nice thing about the merge as I mentioned is that the more in the merge the user could mostly just go to ",
        "6": "sleep before The Verge wake up after The Verge and they get all the benefits of purpose day with a lot of these transitions things are really not that simple right now so the challenge is that there's it's not just a some change at the protocol level that users and developers can forget about it's something where users need to like or really actively think and change their behavior developers need to really optimally if they could change their behavior and like this is true at every level of the ecosystem right ends in order to make easy resource lives as simple as possible and make sure that people actually benefit from the Privacy transition and the CLA transition and the smart contract will the transition the ecosystem really needs to do a lot of work to make the solutions that ",
        "7": "it's building actually work for just basic workflows that users actually have so if you're a simple one right like just paying people and a particular real world in your case of paying people like let's say yeah you know you ask how you know you need to pay someone you have you know you have to ask like how do I pay you and this is exactly the sort of thing that ens is for right and this could be an in-person conversation this could be over um you know signal or a telegram or whatever um you know obviously it's a quick way to answer you know that's what DNS does right Bob can just say hey I'm Bob Dotties and like Bob doesn't have to try to speak this let me know complicated 40 characters per address um you know and the challenge is that this whole ",
        "8": "scheme is designed in a budget ways around the kind of existing not the middle only or one based and not very scalable uh artists and not hearing privacy preserving workflow right so everyone can publicly see it all of the payments that Bob receives and they're in one address they're basically docs they're tied they're tied to you know Obama as a person and sure you know this could be not his uh passport name but it's you know connected to a social network if Alice says okay it's the bomb then someone could like look at the social graph and determine hey this is Alice and Alice is really close to bond and all these things so and it's uh there isn't really a way to have the convenience of ens and at the same time like half price here right now and then he announced ",
        "9": "now so there's that exists only in 101 now you can obviously use again as the store L2 address as you can use it to store Robert store mattresses or whatever uh but you can even use it to store Bitcoin addresses or our ibands for like Fiat painting if you want but like Bob can't actually create a DNS name without sending L1 transactions and today registering the DNS stand as like recent away yet affordable but I remember back in even 2021 when uh you know we were in the middle of the bull market and these were higher like registering an 01 name often cost like more than fifty dollars sometimes even more than a hundred dollars and you know if we get back to those conditions in the future it could easily be even more expensive right so in the whole point of the roll-up Century program is that we expect people to live on way or two protocols right um you know we expect people to be able ",
        "10": "to have entire lives on various like your two protocols without needing to kind of go down to a channel one and send to transactions to L1 almost ever ideally it would want it to be possible to never do things on element and you know if like the robes that your roadmap thing actually ends up happening and if um you know launch internet being super successful then like we could easily see a world where every unwanted protection costs a thousand dollars right and if we're in that world then you know uh it's been a lot of users are going to have no choice but just to do things on elders so can Bob and Megan yell at us and I stay on elsewhere this is the first question um what is Ellis and Barbara on different Elders what if um Alice is on optimism um what if there are multiples yes like what if they're Alice is on um optimism in Norwich Road do we have some kind of ",
        "11": "like subset intersection protocol we are Alice Kim first again automatically declared to about hey I exist in these domains that I have enough money in these domains and you know Bob says like hey you know I I have this one or I guess he you know since Bob was setting his address but like Bob will might want to declare you know windshield to his mom is on and then Alice figures out like hey I can pay Bob over here over here over here and let's choose this one I mean I do it might be ones to have protocols that work like that um you know what if neuron like sandwich Friday here is the facts that you know Alice and Bob will realistically probably be on multiple to his two hour Advantage um and uh finally you know how do we preserve a privacy right so this is actually something that I complained it out in some public forum posts that I think about two years ago and to the EMS team's credit ",
        "12": "um you know they've done a lot of work with ccid and which are ERC 366a and you know this is actually happening right so basically yeah what the what they're doing here is that they have a mechanism where you can have a contract on L1 that owns domains and then it can allow sub domains of those domains to be somewhere on the chain and as long as the contract specifies a way to verify it on change now the reason why I say in Alpha form here is because I believe I'm actually not actually not sure of a way to see it yes I remember at the end of 2022 this was only using uh basically signature verifications from a Gateway so you have to trust the Gateway and then signatures to the Gateway to get verified on the contract and so it's not a trustless way to have a domain and so on l2s uh but if you know ",
        "13": "it's absolutely totally possible and like it'd be well it's been done already so you know feel free to ask the ens optimizency in the chat uh but you know basically the contract on L1 could just be verifying numerical branches against recent State on altitles right I mean so you can have domains on optimism and like there was a stake on all team names and you make it happen you mean it's on optimism and basically Bob will be able to register a sub domain of in this case ecc.if and register it and move it around uh fully on uh on the ultimate somewhere too but then I'm going to be able to use it for other things um so it's not perfect because Bob would not be able to get like East and Bob had to get like Bob dot some sounds amazing ideas but like maybe that's right and you know maybe that kind of group of opens up more namespaces and um you know maybe take some shorter names more accessible ",
        "14": "um you know maybe there there's going to be like 50 different uh you know names that are on optimism and is that you know we're going to do the same thing Waka for traditional alternate names and uh you know if uh uh like I was to have an L2 domain name then maybe someone's gonna put like lyk.ease on Optimus I'm not going to be vita.lik.e but it's that you know we're getting there right so L2 transition for domain names is one of those things where like fortunately you know we can report a lot of progress right which is uh I think really good and really important um Crossway or two transfers right this is the other thing uh which is uh let's say Alice only has coins on uh arbitrum and bond wants to get um money on a scroll like first of all that should be it should be automated and like possible for uh Alice to just ",
        "15": "like make that payments automatically from inside of her wallet like Alex should not have to make extra clicks just to send the payments uh it's a bob if I was on a scroll that like that whole process should be just done in the background there are cross L2 gateways like there's top protocol and there's a bunch of others but like it's not standardized enough in my opinion like what I personally want to see is I want to see like a human swap style protocol for doing Crossway or two transfers like just between an L2 and L2 right now obviously you don't need a protocol if you're willing to go through L1 right if you're willing to withdraw and then redeposit then like you can just do what I mean do it directly but you know even when we have severe Roll-Ups you're going to have some period of time uh before any you actually get a commitment still layer one uh and then you know either give it you'd have to go back to layer two and ",
        "16": "then you have to pay transaction piece on lawyer one and four withdrawals and deposits that are higher than for regular transactions so what it costs a thousand dollars that you know especially at inside of a future called uh you know environment or blockchain can use more often um so it's available this is a challenge right and that for cross-all two transfers basically what their these things do is they get our kind of these marketplaces multiplicity providers where you can give the liquidity providers coins on the arbitrary side and then the liquid they provide your gifts the recipient points on this world side um it's not like what I would love to see it is like a cutest lifestyle protocol right but the next thing you're going through this swap is that it does not depend on specific third parties it does not depend on servers and basically it's but actually a contract common shape right and even smart contracts can talk to you as well so what I would love to ",
        "17": "see is just like a variation you know a simple Eunice love style protocol you know no governance still third-party independencies still anything we're just like you know Arbitrage you know participants can become a new users can come in it can be called by smart contracts and it's fully decentralized and uh and we can just reliably exist it'll expect it'll still exist at the same 410 explore 10 years from now just like you know give us a lot B1 still exists today and if he wants to use it you just don't go and use it um spells addresses right and so this is an interesting use case so basically if LLS will like if Bob wants to accept payments to block.if with that revealing to the world that all of the payments that Barbara see is actually will received by the law right ",
        "18": "um so what's going to do this is a scheme that was originally invented in Bitcoin lands but it's uh extended to ethereum land uh basically the idea is that that provides on-chan aeit what that we call a meta address um or like I guess the meta or rather the meta address is something that uh right it register it with bob.ease or what you just directly give them that address to whoever needs to pay him um and then that meta address allows Alice on her side to generate addresses that volunteva and Bobkins attached to those addresses belongs above and Bob can figure out how to spend from those addresses but no one except for Alice and Bob can determine that that address belongs to model right so from anyone's point of view other than just Alice or Mom this is a meta or this ephemeral address that Alice generates just looks like Indonesia the no random address but ",
        "19": "from Alice's point of view and she's sending to it and from Mom's point of view tests uh in the ephemeral pumpkin registry is about what do you involved as a calculations like hey you know this um ephemeral address actually will uh you know if you generate it with this site with this Emerald string it actually leads to an address that has assets right uh and uh so while do not see what all these yet you know ephemeral addresses are but just that the ones that belong to him and it's all kinds of them that actually has assets then like blocky and our choice then right so um you can actually extend this really nicely with as you get starts right so this is an interesting uh kind of different way to do a stealth addresses that is it requires more complex cryptography than what happens here like this is our big beast we're based on Jiffy element right uh you know see it like basically you have some ",
        "20": "generated address function of the ephemeral private Kia and uh kind of menopause here or the femoral party involvement here and then you know you know this is Olympic or multiplication right like one of ours times big gap is Big R times let alone but um here it's uh you know it's kind of much more generic basically so imagine Bob has a little bit what I call a key store contracts and in the key store contract um you know Bob I think the whole point of this is basically just the store follows a study public here and they're like this actually doesn't even it's not going to need to be a traditional public key it could actually just be a hassle and private key right because we're not actually going to be using regular signatures because we're going to have as he get started but contract is going to have some kind of commitments to Bob's spending to you and also the rules for changing the spending up here right so this could be some social recovery system ",
        "21": "then Bob has about your addresses and you could even have like Alice could generate these actresses right and you like to generate stealth addresses that belongs above um and Bob can generate these addresses for himself um and any the way that anyone generates that is that anyone picks one of these like the random assault values and then make sure that Bob has the random salt value and then the basically inside of one of these Health addresses uh you know what here I haven't drawn as though would say storage I'm like actually you could use create two and you can basically set it up so that the address itself is just a hash of the store and R1 right so this could just be the address and then when the spending logic instead of checking in the storage into the text like it just literally increases the address off code to check what the address is and then that's going to be a hash of b-store so and the or or like something that it like some piece of data is connected to be store ",
        "22": "right like obviously if you're using Korean two if you don't want it to be literally created by the B scores right like it would be created by something else and then you would have like some commitments to be stored as an argument uh and then like you know that would create an address right it would be like so but the point is that it's a hashtag like contains B stores somewhere in the Hashim and I can say it's like random data and other parts um so spending from any of these addresses requires a cpsnr that proves uh that curves like several different statements right so first of all the zika start has to prove that the prover knows what e-store is and the prover knows like some of these other R values that basically derive Bob's address from uh or the point proof that volt address is connected to being stored this is not a public way right if all you see is B Store in the address you you do not have any way to tell that this address is ",
        "23": "connected to be stored and the reason why we need these random values is basically so that you can't have someone like look through all the key stores and you know hash them and ought to try to figure out what all the address is on right we're gonna so these are like 32 by random values so like you know utensils for all of a sudden right so the proofer has the like proves in zero knowledge that the prover knows like what this address is then the proof improves the knowledge of a verbal branch from a recent state bird all the way to the spending the spending public key inside of this key store contract so the approval proves of a branch that goes probably with a state bird uh all the way up all the way down here it has to be a recent state right now this is like an oracle where tradition between branch in the future it'll be something better and then finally the spender has to prove that they know the private key that corresponds to the public key here right um so and as I mentioned before like this doesn't have to be elliptic purposes could just be a hash advantage so spending requires the CBS start and ",
        "24": "if you do it this way then like you basically have complete separation between the spending logic and the addresses and the really nice thing about this right is that this is social recovery friendly like you can have a social acceptable self-address scheme where you do social recovery over here and if you do social recoveries here you're automatically changing the spending Logic for all the stealth addresses and because it's the spending logic is wrapped inside of sdks start nobody knows when the spending logic actually changed uh which I think is beautiful um social recovery and it should be multiple multiple l2s right so this is actually a real challenge that I had when working with at the solvoic team basically you have an account on arbitrary that accounted ultimate so we have an accountant polygon if you want to change the key do you have to like send a recovery transaction on all of them or could you do it in one operation ",
        "25": "um another War seller problem one of the nice things that current uh the current uh you know externally owned accounts got like the address system lets you do it is it lets you receive money even if you've never done anything on change to register your address right like so if I off-chin generate an address and give you the address you can send the assets I could spend in those assets until I spend those assets I don't have to do anything on now how does this work here well let's say you never initiated your account on title right title is another L2 roll up you've never initiated your tail there and someone sent you assets on psycho could you change the key needed to access the biller's assets right could you change the key needed to access an account that you never actually initiated and with this scheme if you make like the the this has to be inside like actually just be at the address um kind of well not with directly to this app so I guess I mentioned like ",
        "26": "it's some different things like a hash of something else and then the address would be to create to um then that you actually could do that right because even for addresses that don't exist yet when you spend them from for the first time the spending will happen as you get started because it gets darker applicants like a via proof of an oracle branch and it'll be a proof of a specific vertical branch and that you know what that which will be in whatever takes your place and you know that will have some property that you could actually change right basically keystore address separation but across the lands your key store contracts can be in one way or two and these addresses could be being totally different with your team so you could have your Keystone Optimus have your addresses on Armature of cockrod and polygon whatever uh whatever else not financial apps right this is going to be the last thing so in after Jerry it's over here and you can transfer the key to sign in across size devices but and the thing that I think we want is to ",
        "27": "move towards is like you know the ethereum wallet being able to generate or at least change this kind of signing key so far faster works this way and I think wants to move in this direction um you know sign in with ethereum like I know if as does sort of similar things but like right I think one of the challenges of signing with ethereum is that are going to be become better at supporting signing in across multiple devices and then the challenge is that what we want this whole ecosystem to support us by cultural developments and support leaders and this should be totally possible it's not too hard probably one Nuance is from a privacy perspective a lot of these non-financial things they are moving toward trying to be more private and more Ezekiel in our face and like here you know you're really using Ezekiel stars for privacy where people see his dark face Dynamic Solutions and the Xerox Park team and other people are working on and all this stuff and in this case like if we talk about social ",
        "28": "recovery there's like recovery of the wallet recovery of control and then there's the recovery of encrypted data right and like these two are different because you can recover the model by changing the key but to recover the data you have to recover things of it which is a different problem Republicans uh we're covering the key is like a more risky thing right and like if you look at how signal Works signal is a recovery process is like well you can recover your accounts but you lose all of your product all of your private messages right and like for their use cases it's actually not that bad or trade enough right so it's application specific maybe you need a recovery strategy for encrypted data maybe you don't maybe your recovery of encrypted data is like less like is something that can accept more risk of data leakage than recovery of control maybe not and like it's it's very application specific some key Solutions are I think scaling is happening the L2 transition is happening privacy is happening you know ",
        "29": "it's that it's definitely a long process that there is definitely age at you know the whole kind of you know regulatory rabbit hole and like trying to figure out the best way to handle that but at the same time give people actual privacy a lot of things uh thanks to the report on that but that also means that we're going to wait for a like that will require its own whole presentation so my question moments are happening uh so um you know the like School moment has Alphas that are kind of actually of the sort of meta mask style drugs or role in format but the user experience needs to adapts to all of these days that we need to make sure that like existing user workflows can actually properly and fully take advantage of all this stuff right like smart contract well it's you know adapts all of you to support ERC 1271 so there's more contract followed from here you know privacy like ens address systems that have have some way of being a privacy friend that is ",
