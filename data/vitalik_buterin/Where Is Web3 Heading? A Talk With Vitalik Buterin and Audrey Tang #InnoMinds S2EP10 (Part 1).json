        "1": "hi welcome to Innovative Minds my pleasure to be here as your host just call me t-plus this show is a forum for leaders in Tech and politics to discuss how to solve today's problems with today's tools today our special guest is Vita leak buterin co-founder of ethereum I'm also here with taiwan's digital Minister Audrey Tang today's discussion will cover opportunities for skilled workers in Taiwan recent projects by Audrey and vitalik and the latest advancements in web3 [Music] okay so before we get started I want to introduce our two guests today leak is a world famous programmer co-founder of ethereum and contributor to many open source software projects featured in season one of innovative Minds through an online interview he is now in Taipei for an in-person conversation with Audrey vitaleak thank you so much for being here would you like to greet our audience in Mandarin just like you did last time foreign ",
        "2": "Audrey Tang is taiwan's digital Minister she became taiwan's youngest Minister without portfolio in 2016 when she headed the public digital Innovation space she has been a hacktivist for over two decades she is also a promoter of Open Source Innovation hi Audrey hello really happy to meet you in higher resolution this time yeah absolutely as I am too so vitaleak it's great to have you here in our recording studio today how do you feel about returning to Taiwan and how was the plurality Taipei conference it's uh good to be back in Taiwan I enjoy coming here um you know every time that I do ever since the my first visit back in 2016. you know there's an excellent ethereum Community here um you know we have some developers and that number just keeps growing um there's just all kinds of a really interesting people doing interesting ",
        "3": "things here yeah and so this time uh you know when I landed here from Japan I got off the plane and went like basically straight to the subplurality events that was happening and uh you know plurality is uh I guess a continuation of uh you know Glenn Wiles work on that started with uh his book radical markets but then kind of expanded a lot to include both I mean like some of Glenn's a new thinking but also like a lot of other people's ideas and it's expanded from you know like not just like better property rights and better voting but also I'm like better ways of having conversations and just all kinds of other things and you just seemed like there was a really good and uh fascinating crew in Taiwan like I was just impressed by the level of uh discussion um you know like the kinds of people who came the kinds of work that the people who were there clearly had already been putting into all of their spaces for decades so you know very ",
        "4": "happy I was able to attend yeah and you also contributed by running your own Community notes instance from x.com and writing to explain how it works and how people interested in plurality can also start their own Community note like replications as well as verifying what x.com is doing with Community notes have you been paying attention to computer notes like when it was birdwatch I uh admit I only yeah started like really yeah deep diving into like the algorithm and how it works recently but like I remember definitely yes seeing you know notes pop up on tweets like even back uh last year and uh two years ago and I definitely yeah remember the notes being high quality I uh also remember the notes doing a good job of like not being preachy in a way that a lot of uh like regular facts checking is right like it doesn't come from this perspective of uh you know we are the ",
        "5": "guys who know what the responsible journalists exactly right and sometimes it's like actually fun and yeah just did a good job of doing all of those uh things and so at some points I got curious like you know what's actually happening behind the scenes here and so I decided to you know like start investigating it a little bit more and then investigating it more and then that turned into that bigger article that I put out last week that's great I think Community knows and police are like the two like most uh people facing examples of the plurality thinking yeah yeah exactly it's interesting right that we're seeing I think this new class of uh algorithms and uh or yes mechanisms or whatever word he wants to use like actually yeah really getting deployed right it's uh you know first we've had rating systems and you know rating systems are one-dimensional and we're ",
        "6": "just trying to you know decide which things are good and uh which things are bad but then you know here we actually kind of go two dimensional right and we say you know like every yeah node has a quality but then it also has a polarity and uh you know we try to I actually identify yeah you know like what portion of people's perspectives is just like notes being compatible with your existing biases and what portion is like some kind of quality that like really yeah surpasses and stretches beyond that right and I mean I think like Glenn Weil's earlier work I think is uh similar in that sense right and that like he has this uh mathematical intuitions for like how to surpass one-dimensional things and uh really yeah like push beyond that and make things that are much better at fitting toward people so you know needs in situations right and uh you know quadratic voting has some of that Spirit um of course and uh you know as does quadratic funding and git coin has been ",
        "7": "using quadratic funding for years now and now you know you know we're not just uh you know talking about like money and property and votes for like actually yeah you know we're talking about one of the most important public conversation platforms on the planet right now and uh Leah's kinds of ideas have actually managed to do a significant job of improving it right so I think it's a big success yeah it has a societal infrastructure feeling to it exactly like yeah that says yeah it's uh the way that Community notes was designed to be yeah you know neutral and open and verifiable and you could download the code check things yourself if you uh you know like see some outcome you could go yourself and dig and see what happens like it's uh you know the exact opposite of um like I think what a lot of people have come to hate from regular social media right and it has all of these amazing properties in ",
        "8": "being this open thing in a way that I think people I mean I was to say expect but maybe more realistically yeah you know you'd say wish uh would uh uh come of uh public infrastructure and uh like this one piece of Twitter has managed to actually do that and and you know like it's done that without really sacrificing on quality right so I yeah hope that it can Inspire your um you know many more things and I think there's a lot more things in the world that can be designed with more of this kind of public infrastructure spirit and I think you know conversations will be higher quality and a lot of people could be happier as a result exactly the ability to contextualize and enhance the quality of online conversations is a clear advantage of community notes Audrey would you like to add something to what vitaleak has just said so first of all I think vitalik's Mandarin became like really like almost native level we carry ",
        "9": "the entire conversation I'm Mandarin to the delight and surprise of many attendees I think plurality is inherent really in a way that Taiwan sees the world we are of many cultures and we pride ourselves in co-creating despite the diversity the polarity never leads to uh too much of violent conflict but rather via Bridge making the kind of italic talked about those mechanisms we Bridge the polarity into plurality so I think the plurality Taipei conference lets the people in Taiwan understand that our kind of unique contributions their angles to the world and also links us to the people around the world that are suffering the same detrimental effect of polarization and hateful messages and things like that and provide I wouldn't say a cure by at least one of the ways to mitigate the harms caused by polarized thinking yeah absolutely ",
        "10": "speaking of Taiwan vitalik you recently obtained a Taiwan employment Gold Card which is a residence visa for skilled professionals could you share your thoughts on the card and any professional projects you might have in Taiwan yeah I mean I don't know personally I'm you know not one of these people that has like a huge number of uh you know like official projects and all kinds of places like I just uh talked to people and cooperate with people uh but uh I uh you know you know with the gold card it makes it much easier for me to come to Taiwan you know like if I want to start spending uh like much more time here in the future there's just all kinds of things that become simpler and like I think in general like I personally just women like really yeah appreciate and uh want to support these kinds of programs not just for people like myself but I mean like also for plenty of high people around the world who are in more difficult situations right like we have to you know remember the world as a very ",
        "11": "uh unfair place a lot of the time and your prospects and life are often decided by yeah you know where you're born um whether or not your parents were lucky enough to figure out how to immigrate somewhere else when you were six you know just all kinds of different things and I think you know Taiwan giving people a yeah a ladder where I mean like if they yeah contribute and you know you can even get the gold card by contributing to open source projects for eight years then like that gets uh recognized and you know you get invited to a yeah a play switches and like one of the Premier world economies and you can work and collaborate with a lot of other people at the at that same level and keep going from there right so I think offering those those kinds of opportunities as just a really important uh you know contribution that like taiwan's making already and I hope that ",
        "12": "in the future we'll see lots of countries having similar programs yeah a lot of people in the ethereum community contributed heavily to web3 partly I believe also because their institutions in their countries are not exactly very stable or their currency isn't exactly very stable and that motivates their contribution to something Odo knew is already seeing more stability than their original jurisdiction but this is difficult for us in Taiwan of course to directly imagine because the new Taiwan Dollar is doing just fine but the majority World actually faces these issues on a day-to-day basis so we really like to contribute to the World by saying that by contributing to fix the issues in an open way for eight years you're then recognized as a contributor to the Free World essentially and we're happy to spend more time with people who contribute to open source for eight ",
        "13": "years absolutely yeah Audrey as taiwan's digital Minister could you provide more information on how individuals with digital skills can obtain the Taiwan employment Gold Card yeah so uh although we call it a digital gold card it doesn't mean that you have to write programs in order to earn it uh programmers is just one of the community contributions in open source Community although the code for ethereum mostly was written eight years ago the white paper was not years ago if I remember correctly writing white papers writing ideas uh blog posts things like that as long as it can inspire people to build something that works together counts as contribution as long as it's publicly validatable right and so ethereum and other distributed ledgers provides a pretty good mechanism to verify the timestamp like this really happened eight years ago and not like eight ",
        "14": "months ago and so on so we expect to see more or proof of participation proof of contribution and things like that as a kind of self-identified but Community verifiable Way of proving that I have been contributing to open source for eight years and all of them then qualify regardless of the format or the specific ways or the programming or natural languages that people contribute as long as it's recognized by Community yeah and I think be recognizing uh more like people's contributions in a more diverse way that captures more kinds of work as a really important problem especially now that I mean with lots of collaboration is I mean moving on to the internet and moving into formats that are not easily captured by traditional structures right where I mean like even if you look at like a lot of academic research these days and in the ",
        "15": "development of new algorithms and like computer science and cryptography for example like just how much of it happens over telegram chats between people and three different companies in five different countries right it's uh actually pretty amazing um and you know sometimes you have people inside of companies and then just a totally independent researchers people who have uh you know like self-studied their way yet in in various ways I mean like people writing code people doing things like translations and uh documentations I mean even just explaining things that already exist as itself a contribution to progress right just all kinds of these different things that are happening and I think having more different ways to recognize that and maximize the chance that if I give you something that's positive and important to get captured somehow is an important problem to solve yeah I mean I've been aware of zero knowledge proof sort of a while but I only gained the ability to explain such proofs thanks to ",
        "16": "your writing so I think this is really two different skills one is applying it in our daily open source contributions and yet another altogether to make it digestible by the community yes and often it's a different piece of work to make it digestible for each Community exactly coming back to taiwan's Tech sector vitaleak what do you think makes taiwan's digital space so special and appealing um I mean I've come here but you know about probably six times in total so far and I just seeing um you know both our ethereum community and then some uh you know people in other Tech spaces and other spaces in general and I think the things that I have been impressed by are I mean one is just a willingness to learn um and a yeah willingness to like study and pursue with things just for for the sake of curiosity um the interest in the open source ",
        "17": "ideals and look building things that are open and look for a collaboration and these kinds of values um just in interest in um you know like doing things not just because they yeah get like the most compensation in the short term I think uh I mean like people aren't always just I mean like immediately chasing the highest salaries which I think is a positive um and I mean like I think having that attitude leads to more success in the long run um oh you know there's just a bunch of uh positive attributes that I've personally noticed and then I've also just uh I mean like a bunch of individual projects that I've noticed that are interesting like polis um as you've mentioned uh you know came out of uh Taiwan and that's one of those things that's quietly being ",
        "18": "used by more and more projects in all kinds of spaces and obviously yeah some of the gov zero work that has been done over the last decade and it seems impressive and it seems valuable so yeah a lot of good things yeah um I've been personally using like open source Fork of hack MD only later to discover oh dear Taiwanese it's good to hear that Audrey can you tell us more about how governments can attract and develop both International and local talents in the tech sector yeah and I think these two are really the same thing uh because what vitalik's been talking about is that in each community in each project in each um doll there really is no restriction that says only people of a certain country can form associations and they have to talk uh through intermediaries and Science mous and sending ambassadors and and so on right naturally within a ",
        "19": "Discord Channel or within a conversation group people identify each other by the projects they contribute to and only later discover earlier Tony's or from some other countries so this contribution first to mentality uh paves away for the kind of talent that builds uh connections and builds Street Credibility in a way that transcends the borders transcends boundaries and I think uh in order for our talents to retain such sick motivation the best way is just to spend more time with people with similar intrinsic motivation and who have traveled far and wide and so the goat card is designed of course for you to travel to Taiwan easier but it's also designed to create a community so that even if the goat holders are not physically in Taiwan they can also introduce our talents to people whomever and wherever you are in you mentioned Japan but maybe in Argentina or in any other places and then the community becomes truly multinational and so you ",
        "20": "have also I believe talked about this idea of a community that governs itself like a network so whether you call it a narrow Society or whatever other terms or zuzalu and so on anything Taiwan is just one part in that conversation in that contribution the more our young people identify with this kind of cross-border network and Community the more circulator uh this hotel and pool becomes and I sincerely believe that open source is one of the best ways to enable this kind of community yeah I think I mean the internet and open source technology in general is doing a lot in enabling new ways for people and groups of people to organize and then and I think what's interesting is a big portion of that what happens pretty organically right it's uh like sometimes people love focusing on um you know creating the incentives and ",
        "21": "like working really hard on optimizing the details of voting schemes and all kinds of things but a lot of the time like you just need a pretty thin layer of that and what matters the most is just uh if you have some queer um you know a thing that you're building towards and look there's some story that appeals to a lot of people and those people appeal to each other then they're going to just wants to collaborate and they're going to want to I'm going to work together to build it and make the best version of it that they can happen so I mean the crypto space I think has been interesting just in how it's managed to Pioneer a lot of that right like as uh you know like I've mentioned a lot of algorithms get developed by just uh you know like people in telegram chats between three different companies and uh five different countries um the way in which the crypto Community also uh operates In This Very geographically decentralized way right ",
        "22": "like if he had to ask someone like you know what is the capital of AI right like which city like there is a clear answer right and you know San Francisco but uh if you had to ask that same question for crypto like there just has no answer right there's like a collection of maybe five or ten different cities that have uh you know a bunch of uh and crypto activity but otherwise like it just happens everywhere right like even ethereum's own history you know the foundation was uh registered in Switzerland um a lot of its early development work and still some of its biggest development work happens in Berlin um the there's a significant uh team in Asia that's an entity in Singapore a couple of uh developers in Taipei now um also uh some in Romania the there's a uh you know research Retreats I mean happening in Colorado so it's uh just ",
        "23": "all kinds of people from all kinds of uh different uh walks of life and like we there's a bunch of things that happen that makes uh helps everyone to cooperate without having to push everyone into being like in any kind of particular mold like a particular structure or you know like under a particular person or schedule right and I think that's like a really yeah fascinating and amazing and uh in one of my interests is definitely seeing like to what extent things like that can be expanded upon right like we yeah have this uh opportunity it's uh um you know try to do a better job of uh like building things um around the around uh you know like values that people have and like and things where people have existing uh common interests um that like try to give structure to that and actually yeah you know like how ",
        "24": "people work toward those uh those common goals even if those people don't uh like at the beginning come from the same place right and you know communities that start online can go offline um Community is uh that you know like start offline can also go online it can be fluid and in both directions and I think that there's you know a lot that can be done to make that happen happen even better and indeed I really like how you talk about those cities as if they're like names of neighborhoods in one city so so really it's a kind of born Global idea where the entire planet is one city and then we have some neighborhoods yeah yeah it definitely does feel like it's going that way it's refreshing to think of the planet as one big community on another note during your conversation last year you both talked a lot about decentralized autonomous organizations have there been any noteworthy updates in the past one year in the world of Dallas ",
        "25": "um good question it's interesting I feel like Dio is within the crypto space are sort of starting to become boring in a certain sense right and that like we know that you know you can have pools of capital that are controlled by a program called a smart contract that defines some set of rules but that determine when those assets can be spent and a lot of projects are organized in that way and there's different structures for like how to make a proposal to like either get some funds out of that um out of that pool that can be used for the a Project's uh benefit or potentially do other things and I mean like how those proposals get voted on and then how they get executed um and you know I've seen them uh running for a long time and I feel like we've gotten to the point where like we've learned more and more lessons there um I think one of the really important ",
        "26": "lessons has been that like the kind of decentralization that you want to maximize is not the kind of decentralization that says we're going to maximize the number of people who have voice on some Global thing that uh is connected to everything right like if you just have uh you know like 500 people vote on things and you have like internet Forum politics so like basically yeah run what happens like you're not even going to get a coherent Vision right and everything is just going to be slow um if your Dow gets into a conflict with other things that actually might end up being at a disadvantage because of its decentralization that was an interesting one that God discovered a couple of years back um the kind of decentralization that you really wants to maximize is like more like local autonomy right like empowering in individual teams that are folk focused around a particular task to just go off and do their thing and that's uh something that that was ",
        "27": "our you know starting to do more and more and when their decentralization focuses in that direction it tends to be more productive and so I think that was uh one thing that's interesting to discover and then the other big thing is uh just you know the importance of not going too crazy on optimizing the uh the voting because ultimately yeah you know the Voting is just a yeah a lawyer on top and it needs to not break right um and I think there are ways that it can break if it's designed badly right like I yeah often criticize these doubts that are based on coin voting that where if you have that and then especially if you combine that with a reality where like 41 of the tokens gets issued to um you know the core team and some Silicon Valley VC investors then like it's not actually yeah particularly Democratic or even decentralized like basically yeah you know especially given how most people end up uh not not voting ",
        "28": "and just forgetting because they're lazy like if the VCS want something to happen they just vote and they make it happen right um so there's ways in which they can break and there's like ways in which uh Dow designs could be improved so not breaking those particular ways but like once you've gotten past that basic point of uh you know like not being a photography or just in whatever other way not breaking like it's really less about the formality and just more about um you know creating space for people's existing I mean like intrinsic motivations to fly and look when projects do that they can you know often be pretty successful yeah when I hear boring I think mainstream right right so basically it's mainstreaming this idea that not just a shareholder uh near-term capitalism uh can organize people people can organize on different principles uh literally just changing some dials on the dial governance and they're all ",
        "29": "equally legitimate and the intrinsic motivators are even more legitimate in the long run absolutely Audrey in last year's conversation with vitaleak you've shown a keen interest in inventions that vitalik has been involved in such as quadratic funding and soul bound tokens fast forward to today have there been any concrete breakthroughs in these areas perhaps you could start by explaining in simple terms why these inventions are of Interest sure um so the idea of quadratic funding is that when we want to fund the societal infrastructure or the common public good uh it is often difficult for a panel of experts to determine which ones are actually benefiting the people the most so some uh donors some people who want to spend money to charity uh often say oh let's just do a matching fund so that we crowdfund and for each dollar you raise I will also contribute one dollar or X dollars but the problem of that of ",
        "30": "course is that it's exactly one coin votes one vote right so the people who can mobilize a large amount of money even though it's just benefits like two or three people uh can easily win those matching funding pools so between the panel of experts on one side and the matching crowdfunding on the other um the credit funding basically measures both it says that you have to mobilize a lot of people each contributing a little bit more instead of just one or two people contributing a lot and they do so by simply taking a square root of each person's contribution to measure what kind of societal impact is having to the crowdfunding community and key of this of course is that one person cannot Fork into 10 people and each contributes a different amount and then pretend to be four people or 10 people or whatever because that defeats the purpose and so a lot of innovation is on making sure ",
        "31": "that one person cannot easily create thousands of clones of oneself to pretend that they're actually you know mobilizing both the money ends the votes right so that I think has also become mainstream or boring in that people generally understand what are the challenges in ensuring their defense and also some working prototypes of that defense uh being seen in real life for example in Bitcoin and in other places yeah so this will help want to add to this yeah no no I think it's a great description right I think the the core idea right that the matching ratio depends not just on or the battery amount depends not just on the amount of dollars that went in but the amount of different people that those dollars are split between is like the really key idea right so if one project gets uh 100 each from two people and another project gets one dollar each from 200 people the second project is going to get like much more matching like tens of times more ",
        "32": "matching than the first right and uh with uh is that idea like you get to determine not just like which goods are more important and less important but also which goods are more public and less public right and uh you know it's also a nice uh mechanism because it's kind of more robust to differences of opinion right in the sense that if you just uh rely on like majority vote style democracy then generally things either pass or fail right and uh if uh you know like a critical Mouse supports uh one way of doing things then like it might get funded but then a group that supports uh a smaller way a a different approach would get no support at all right whereas quadratic finding is more likely to kind of let a thousand flowers bloom um so and look we've actually seen that happen in uh well the git coin implementations of it in practice which I think have been really fascinating yeah in addition to Bitcoin in Taiwan uh we have three uh ",
        "33": "major crowdfunding sites and they're now partnering together to run our own quantitative funding round uh so the same person uh donating uh to uh the same project on three different sites we will not count as three people uh and so I think more and more uh crowdfunding sites can actually join in a kind of Federation of uh the project story being told in various different ways as Vitality noted each project can tell the story differently to different communities but at the end of the day of course we need to count unique contributors so once that technical part is like fully resolved and which we will do so this year I think you will see more adoption by more traditional Charities uh and so on because it's then connected to the Fiat world or not just the cryptocurrency world and for still bound tokens it's also become boring or mainstream when we uh started saying that we would be issuing surbound tokens people were very much still speculating on nfts which the entire point is to ",
        "34": "transfer out of one's account right so sbts were seen as you know too idealistic because people were I don't know collecting ape pictures or things like that unfortunately uh this year this is passed to us and so people start to see oh this is actually a really nice way to have verifiable credentials issued you know thing that is publicly accountable can calculate timestamped very precisely and then you can do interesting calculations without compromising privacy so we've been issuing sbts for people participating in ideas on and in other programs that we run and the general uptake is pretty good yeah I know that's uh definitely yeah good to see it I mean I think uh I mean sbts can um you know like have a lot of uh different names right and I think just like the concept of attestations uh given or you know like Pope proof of proof of attendance protocol uh tokens or another example ",
        "35": "like there's just a lot of uh you know very similar ideas and it does like feel like they're we've been catching on not I mean not quite yet in terms of uh users but definitely in servers are like people starting to build things around them right and it's a like queer that there's demand for something like them right like uh even I mean like as we were mentioning before like tokens says that are or ways of representing past contributions that a person made I mean like skills that a person has like different forms of membership in a particular Community like there's a lot of use cases for this I mean like even you know like within the ethereum community but I think it's something that just makes sense to adopt in a lot of different cases more generally exactly I mean the gold card is not for reselling for such cases uh it's obviously you want it to be so bound ",
        "36": "you're you're telling me it's not like a literal piece of gold that I could go upon I'm sorry but not hmm vitaleak something that's been keeping you busy over the last few months has been your involvement in the zuzolo project from what I read online this was a pop-up Community whose aim was to discuss biotechnological Solutions designed to slow down human aging and live longer can you tell us more about what it is exactly no it's uh it's interesting that the uh the piece that you wrote focused on the Aging angle right because it's uh Zuzu was kind of intentionally created as this kind of pluralist community with about like three or five different focuses and you know biotech was one of them but there are also uh several others as well right um I think the way that I would describe the idea of uh Zozo in general is that like for a long time there has been a lot of excitement around this idea of ",
        "37": "either creating new cities or creating new societies um or um taking online communities and bringing them offline and moon look really being a kind of intentional about offline community and the and the physical environments and like where and you know the kinds of physical Network effects that were create but we're creating and uh participating in and this is something that a lot of people have written about um look often a very idealistically for decades there's uh and a lot of writing in the 80s and 90s talking about this idea that we live in physical communities but at the same time like our values and the things that we are going to use and benefit from are going off on this totally separate digital access and like are there ways to kind of you know bring ",
        "38": "the first uh kind of vote more you know more in line with the second and uh you know Obama said recently wrote his book on the network stage and there was also a book by yeah someone called David de Ugarte on what he calls files that's p-h-y-l-e-s that like goes takes a very different political angle on what's something that's like ultimately not too different as a concept and one of the goals of uh zozoa was to just to take some of that discussion and sort of bring things from the space of just discussion like a step closer into a live experiment so we can see he has something run and like how people respond to it and what the consequences are right so the concept is basically bring together about 200 people from a combination of a few different communities so the biotech Community was was one I think they're actually at least three biotech sub communities ",
