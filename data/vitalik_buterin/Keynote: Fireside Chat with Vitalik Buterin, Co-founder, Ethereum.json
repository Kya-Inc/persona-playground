        "0": "hi everyone thank you again uh for uh being here with us uh and it's really my pleasure to introduce to you all vitalik buterin uh thank you vitalik for joining us here for this fireside chat thank you brian it's great to be here so we first met in 2015 in san francisco on your original road show for the ethereum ico and i was really impressed by the vision for the ethereum ecosystem and it's one of my greatest regrets in life not having jumped in with a small bit of investment that day i admit i was completely daunted by the prospect of what you were building and i didn't think it was possible so when we met a year later in shanghai it was clear that i was mostly wrong and in my new role at hyperledger i was intent on making sure that we didn't second-guess this community being built even while hyperledger was set to really explore the more permission side of the blockchain space these days i like to think that while we're more full spectrum at hyperledger with hyperledger bay zoo and other efforts the bridge of these two worlds um you know so what we're here to do is talk about the future of ethereum and ",
        "1": "how it relates to this thing called the enterprise but i want to start on those early days so let me ask even before ethereum kicked off you participated in the early days of in the development of the bitcoin ecosystem and the bitcoin code base what was it about those early days of that that open source community around bitcoin that made it so accessible to to a young vitalik and i think one of the fascinating things about the bitcoin community early on is just how it managed to attract and bring together like many very different kinds of people right because like crypto as a whole is itself a very multidisciplinary thing right you have the cryptography you have the math you have the economics you have the monetary theory you have the social and political um implications and you have businesses trying to do things with it and there are definitely many different people like even back in the community in 2011 that just came at it from all of these different perspectives right and you know sometimes the ",
        "2": "perspectives were very different and you know there was even some uh a healthy and vigorous uh debate on the bitcoin forums uh back in 2011 this was you know back before they were even called bitcoin talk and you know i was interested in a lot of things at the time like i've always been interested in math i've been interested in cryptography i was interested in economics as well also you know interested in i guess the bigger questions of uh life and the human civilization uh so the big way in the community it definitely had uh some of all of that and it was just a a great forum to just talk with other people that had all of these and different and interesting ideas and then also there were there was this just vibrant community of uh people that was just you know willing to come in and help and uh build whatever needed to be built right like you know we needed to build a bitcoin client and there was this community of core developers that was working on and ",
        "3": "improving their client uh we needed to build bitcoin wallets people came in and just made wallets and you know you needed a way for people to see what's going on in the blockchain people just came in and built block explorers so there was this great uh kind of community collaborative feeling there at the time which i definitely really like and that's definitely one of the things that i definitely really value and kind of care about really trying to support an ethereum as well yeah yeah well sometimes when us when we in the open source community talk about um that about the community and about how things work we can sometimes sometimes i i'm guilty of making it sound like spontaneous combustion you know like these things just happened and we didn't know why or how um but when you think about the the ethereum ecosystem now and like the role that the foundation is playing and and others are there specific things like you think about or or that they think about in terms of helping foster the the right kind of community around especially the the development the open source community around the development of ethereum ",
        "4": "um i mean i think uh it's having a good open source community definitely a guide like there's a lot of different ingredients that i think you need to get right like one of them is just that like the ecosystem needs to be one that's kind of open and welcoming and like if someone wants to come in and contribute they actually can go do that um like it's definitely easy to just even accidentally fail at that and like accident accidentally just you know end up either driving away contributors when you don't needs to or just like not making it clear that there's things where people just that can go in and participate um also and i think ethereum has been kind of successful just because of what it is right like it's not asia a kind of you know finite bounded system in the sense of just you know here's one thing that you can do with it and like you know this is money or this is a domain name system or like this is one thing ",
        "5": "um it's an open platform and people can just uh you know go into and like build their own make interesting and amazing things and just like having that space is um also i think important for having an ecosystem that developers are excited about um also and i think there's just like you do have to get the get the economics right like and this is one of the challenges of this community is right like especially with crypto that like on the one hand um well like i think like the biggest difference i think between like crypto projects in the ecosystem and say the open source ecosystem of you know the early 2000s is that like there's money involved and there is like a significant amount of money for kind of floating around you know you got the coins and the coins go up and the coins go down and then and then there's new coins and there's new points going up and down uh and on the one hand like this means that you actually have ",
        "6": "an opportunity to like try to even pay people like compensate people who are doing really important work um which you know i think is important right like you can rely on volunteers for some things you can rely on volunteers for smaller projects but and the the challenge with kind of just relying on volunteers instead of going forever is that like first of all you know you're not all that's going to necessarily attract enough people and also like if you have this ecosystem where like some people are contributing for free but then other people are making millions out of it like that just feels very unfair to people right and like that is a legitimate challenge though for the the crypto space as well right that like sometimes you do have this imbalance and like you make this one valuable tool and like okay maybe you can get a grant but then you make this uh other thing where like you you've come up with a way to stick a coin in the middle of it and uh you know you get like 25 million dollars if you see investment flying at you and like that's an imbalance and ",
        "7": "and we've definitely tried to do our best to address that imbalance and like at the same time as um you know trying to prevent like the adhering foundation itself from sort of being an overly dominant pull in the ecosystem so that's also a challenge um another important challenge is just like appealing to the kind of diverse community like you know not everyone that might want to contribute speech english that's probably the most obvious example and like just making you know our contents documentation everything's like accessible and different languages trying to actually engage with all the local communities is something that we've valued and we're trying to do for a long time as well cool well yeah there's so many different pressures at play and and compared to like the idyllic early days of apache or linux or something like that it sometimes feels like these pressures can really create such a such an intense kind of pressure cooker environment um uh some of those pressures ",
        "8": "increasingly i feel like they might be coming from people trying to adopt these technologies for enterprise uses you know i think of the enterprise i think of star trek or whatever is kind of this almost you know impossibly big or menacing thing but uh but really some of these are for very prosaic use cases right for settlement systems for for um regulatory reporting or auditing that sort of thing how much are those pressures on the backs of the core ethereum developers how much are you thinking about this you know especially with the design for ethereum too uh uh were these kinds of use cases and needing to support those use cases on your minds as you're you were designing the f2 design yeah and i think like enterprise users of blockchains are definitely really important and and i think like the big the biggest way in which um eth2 in particular can help enterprises is just having more scalability right that's because you know right now transaction fees are high and one of the challenges with a ",
        "9": "transaction fees being high is that like first of all it just prices out users but like it prices out different kinds of users differently right like it i think the people who get priced out first often are just like you know the people that wants to use the blockchain for uh doing basic non-financial things like whether it's you know supply chain tracking or even things like ens or just about everything that's not moving high value crypto tokens around and so when the fees go up to ten dollars like you know all that's left is like well there's some high value domains and then there's like a lot of moving crypto tokens around our vision in ethereum has always been to be this platform that's open to all of these different um applications where you know the limit is just your creativity but if in practice just the economics make it so it's only viable to do a few things then in some ways that's like a big limitation on how much of our mission we can actually accomplish so you know the the dream of scalability right is you know we have roll ups and ropes already exist for some ",
        "10": "applications and now general purpose roll-ups are coming very soon right like uh arbitral recently yeah released their uh thing on main net and then optimism has a kind of limited uh rollout on maintenance that they've been slowly expanding over time zk sync has been making god great progress right um and at the same time we've been working on charting which kind of improves the base layer itself so that um at the base where you have something like 100 times more scalability right so shorting times 100 roll up times 100 the two multiplied times 10 thousand and like the hope is that you can simultaneously like make the platform able to handle more users and like reduce transaction fees right and so it's like supply and demand right you have more supply and so you know you don't have like all of these users kind of bidding against each other so hard so if transaction fees can go down then you know we're hoping by a factor of uh uh of a hundred but we'll see um but then that like opens the door for all of ",
        "11": "these other applications again and like there are a lot of people you know even in enterprise that even wants to use the public shade right like there's you know like ey and like the the nightfall i think it was like the baseline protocol there's all of these amazing groups trying to like do public chain based um enterprise things and again i get like i definitely believe in kind of the public chain i guess because like i i don't even know what wants to see a future where you know like enterprise and kind of you know the people have to be these kind of two different poles that are you know either different universes are kind of viewed as opposing each other like you know we should have an ecosystem where you know the enterprises and everyone they can just all live together and uh the ecosystems can kind of plug into each other and benefit each other much more and and um but the challenge is that you know if you want anyone to be building on the public chain then you know the transaction fees have to go down and then also privacy issues have ",
        "12": "to be solved and and that's like the other benefit right like you have all of these like very diverse different groups like just building and working on this technology and like everyone can just use each other's stuff ideally um so i'm optimistic about that future good good and you mean it isn't as easy as just increasing the block size by 10x no no elon said it was so i thought i thought that was that that was that was the case um and obviously one of the big changes coming up in ethereum too is the move from proof of work to proof of stake which um you know a lot of people are concerned about the energy consumption of uh of maine of cryptocurrencies in general um uh you know how much was uh the environmental concerns on your mind as you were designing to uh is the move largely driven by that or were there were there other motivations um and i think i think it was def it's definitely a major reason why people wants to move over um i think like the the consequences of um you know the amount of like ",
        "13": "energy and even just stuff that proof-of-work systems consume are pretty significant right like and people like often talk about you know the energy waste aspect but then there's also uh like first of all you know even if you're using amazing solar power you know you're still which you know there's not everyone else like you're still taking away energy that could be used by other people and like you know we've seen like in iran they're the the government's been angry because of like electricity being displaced from local villages and so forth and then there's hardware and hardware has its own environmental costs uh so going from that to a consensus model where the the economics are fully virtualized which is you know what proof of stake is right like we've even talked about like group of stake validators just being kind of like virtual miners right um you know they're like miners except you know it's all kind of digital and just simulated by the system and and that just like completely solves all of ",
        "14": "these problems so you know we don't even have to argue about them and we don't have to just like get into these lengthy debates of like you know who's using coal and who's using solar and like is the solar actually solar and all of this stuff like no just like making yes that's the word you know the the resource get requirements as a whole or just more than a thousand times lower like that's definitely i think it's definitely a big um a big motivation for us i mean obviously of course at the same time there is a kind of the more selfish factor which is that if you uh reduce like the fact that you need so much electricity and like hardware like you also need to pay for that stuff and to pay for that stuff you just have to like print a huge number of coins and that like you know it does risk the the economic sustainability of the system of kind of the you have to choose between you know either the supply of coins just kind of continuing to go up non-stop or between potentially risking um security going down to very low levels and like once again you know with the proof of sake we don't have that ",
        "15": "trade-off uh so i think you know it's uh good for the good for the ethereum community and good for the users good for the world that's always great when things line up that way yeah that's great and um just a a as a wrap-up question what's what is the one technology you think uh in the ethereum ecosystem as a whole that you're most excited about when it uh when you think about the needs of enterprises or the needs of getting this uh kind of infrastructure adopted by by the mainstream of society what kind of infrastructure um i think like some of the higher level stuff that i'm most concerned about so i think like we've talked about privacy uh and like and i've talked about it a lot previously as well and it's definitely important right like you know you don't want i know twitter for your bank account right um and like the nice thing about like combining blockchains and cryptography is that you have a lot of room to just like make all of these like ",
        "16": "different compromises between them you know privacy and what your other goals are you can kind of much more freely define like what it is you're actually getting and at the same time you know the blockchain has this verifiability and auditability so you know if you like need like if you want need like whether for an audit or investigation or something like prove that you know here's things that happened before and like look i did every i i did everything the way i was supposed to be doing like you you you can and you can just kind of selectively reveal whatever information you want right like so there's a great future for like improving privacy um security i think is also important right like uh i still remember and uh frequently linked back to the bitcoin magazine article i wrote in 2013. this was like a bitcoin wallet security uh and then there were these kind of nightmare stories of uh you know a guy has a half a million dollars a bitcoin and then he wakes up and then he doesn't have half a million dollars a bitcoin what happens i don't think we know yet and you know there's you can have ",
        "17": "someone's computer someone's computer can get lost um if you write the words down on a piece of paper someone can steal the piece of paper the piece of paper can get lost um you know there's just all of these things that can happen and like i've talked about ideas like i've talked about things like multi-sig wallets and social recovery wallets and all these things to try to like reduce the the risk that things like that happen and like actually make like cryptographic keys or at least kind of blockchain while it's a more viable way of like authenticating a person and but you know it's this is so you know like i feel like we've seen improv fairly big improvements over the last uh three years as well uh right and i feel like you know we're gonna continue to see improvements in the future so you know once again like it's both like for me a big concern and a worry but it's also something that i'm gonna get very excited about uh seeing fix because i know it is gonna be fixed yeah thank you so much vitalik i mean i ",
        "18": "i'm reminded of the quote from uh mahatma gandhi which is first they ignore you then they laugh at you then they fight you and then you win and i see this pattern repeated whether it's the early days of the internet people were concerned we can't use it for commercial purposes because it's this research thing and it's unreliable um then they say that about open source software i i you know there's a transition point in like the late 90s where it's like okay maybe we can use this for enterprises um and i think that's a similar transition point we're at when it comes to thinking about the full spectrum of blockchain technologies and i think the ethereum ecosystem is playing a key role in that in that transition so thank you so much for your time and uh looking forward to talking with you again soon yeah thank you brian and thank you for just all the great work you've been doing with hyperledger very sweet thanks "
