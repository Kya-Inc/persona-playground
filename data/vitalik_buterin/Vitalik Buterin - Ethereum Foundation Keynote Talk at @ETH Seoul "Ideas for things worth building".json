        "0": "good morning has the morning actually been good okay great uh so since your morning is good like let's talk about building stuff uh so things that so this is just to kind of give a few different categories of ideas that i think are really worthwhile for people to start building and to start like really concretely working on like right now and so in general i think like a lot of things have changed in the uh crypto space and in the ethereum and the development world in particular in the last two years like a lot of uh technologies that were like really just like thoughts and ideas and theories uh two years ago have like slowly become very real um over the last couple of years and in in a few voices recently like i've talked about what some of those changes are right like one is the fact that you know we have roll ups we have scaling uh things are getting cheaper ",
        "1": "again uh so a lot of applications are just much more economically viable than they were one or two years ago and so you know when before like you might even say well maybe d5 is the only thing that makes sense to build because defy is the only thing where people are willing to pay like 12 dollars a transaction well now you know transactions are cost much less than 12 dollars and rollups are getting better every day so there's a lot of other things that you can build as well right um another really big and really important thing that's been happening over the last five years is the growth of zero knowledge technology right so like i actually think that zk snarks might be like almost or even equally as important to the kind of you know privacy openness and you know freedom kind of alternative decentralized web tech movement as blockchains are like they're actually extremely powerful tools they're extremely effective at giving us privacy ",
        "2": "giving us scalability and and at the same time preserving security which is a similar thing to what blockchains are trying to do right and in some ways like zero knowledge proofs and blockchains are actually very good complements for each other right because blockchains give you a lot of security but in exchange they sacrifice privacy and they sacrifice scalability ziki snarks give you back privacy and they can give you back scalability um so build ck apps right uh basically i think we've now gotten to the point where the tools for building a lot of zika snark applications are just getting better and better every year um the protocols are getting better and better our ability to prove things like make proofs that you can actually prove on a computer in a reasonable amount of time is getting better and better i remember in 2016 when the first version of z cash launched it took like more than one minute to generate a signature and today ",
        "3": "like all of these applications they can generate proofs in like somewhere sometimes three seconds sometimes like less than one second depending on you know what technology you're using so build zero knowledge applications um zero knowledge applications are i think uh great for uh both uh privacy and uh scalability um right so um here like i have this a link to a blog post if you just uh if you just go to vitalik.ca or orvitalic.ethe.link either one i mean you just like scroll down the list um i wrote this post about one or two months ago or just talk about some of the ways that you can use your knowledge proofs uh to actually build uh many kinds of applications that uh preserve privacy and there's also a lot of applications obviously of your knowledge proofs for scalability right so zk roll ups are a great example and there's a bunch of ",
        "4": "teams building ziki roll-ups for the evm which i think is great um privacy i think is still a bit less explored than scalability actually so just like some interesting examples of uh privacy preserving applications that uh might make sense to work on um privacy preserving like proof of humanity or privacy preserving proof of pope like basically like in ethereum we have we're starting to have like more and more of these protocols where they're basically issuing like some kind of attestation to like um at different like specific addresses to say something about the person who controls that address right so the proof of humanity protocol for example it's a protocol um where if you you have to sign up and there's like a dow that verifies the submissions and if it accepts you then it basically says like this address corresponds to some unique human right so it's not a ",
        "5": "bot it's not like one person having five thousand accounts it's like one specific person that has one account and if you do if you have proof of humanity as an ingredient then like you can start building a lot more powerful um applications you have like a lot of a lot more room to decide like what kinds of things you'll be building right so for example you could build an airdrop where instead of like doing an airdrop just based on um you know how like how many coins does someone have how many transactions have someone sent you can like say i'm going to actually give like 15 coins to every single human right um you know you could do like even nft sales in a way that's more fair um you can do a sale uh just create market mechanisms that try to be like more fair to individual people in some way um i'll talk about this later but like there's also um ways to make uh decentralized governance more ",
        "6": "fair if you try to like count humans instead of just counting coins um and privacy preserving proof of pope so pope the proof of attendance protocol is a protocol that basically lets you say this address belongs to someone who actually participated at some event right so like i went to you know a conference in argentina last year and i got a pope for it right so there is a pope that that that god given out to everyone who visited this conference in argentina and so you don't just know that this person is a human but you you actually know like what kind of communities they're part of and like what a different no how much have they participated in like in different kinds of communities right so you get more of this kind of information now one of the big challenges with both of these protocols is privacy right like you're basically revealing to the anyone who can read the blockchain like who you are um and this ",
        "7": "is a big privacy risk but at the same time like i think there's a lot of really important things that we can gain from having these protocols and so the challenge is like how do we get the benefits without the costs right and zero knowledge proofs could actually help a lot here right like with zero knowledge proofs you could do something like prove that you are a unique human without revealing which human you are um you could prove that you have a pope and that you attended like five events from a particular list without revealing like which events you attend specifically attended and without revealing like what your actual identity is so a lot of interesting applications there um zk negative reputation uh so this is actually one of the sort of more advanced um examples in this post that i wrote basically the idea is to have a reputation system where you can make attestations that are not just positive but also negative um so you'll ",
        "8": "be able to prove things like you know i have like i participated in some decentralized social media platform and i made these posts that got upvoted but i did not but i also did not get down voted or like i also did not like have did not get flagged for abuse uh so you can do like all of these things but at the same time also preserve people's privacy right um zero knowledge and npc data marketplaces this is um interesting like i think a lot of people have been interested in this idea of like creating like more fair market voices for data um and yeah no there's applications of this in healthcare there's applications of this and like a lot of different spaces but there the problem is that like it's not just a blockchain problem right because you are trying to solve a trust problem but the trust problem you're trying to solve is not just the kind of trust problem that a blockchain solves you're ",
        "9": "also trying to solve a problem of privacy right a problem of like i want to give a little thing about a little piece of data about myself but i don't want to give more data than that i mean ideally like he wants to even give data that contributes to like say someone's machine learning model without actually like giving them giving them the data directly right and if he wants to do those kinds of things then you need a different kind of cryptography called multiplayer multi-party computation so combine zero knowledge proofs and multi-party computation try to create better data marketplaces i mean this is a very advanced topic but i think like this is the frontier and there's a lot of exciting things that you can build here so those are just a few examples of things that you can build with zero knowledge stuff i mean i think building with your knowledge tech is still it is still advanced but it's getting less and less advanced and the tools are becoming more accessible with every year ",
        "10": "so i still you know encourage people to really look at the tech and really consider like even now using uh using it to build something uh soulbound tokens uh so this is um something that um a couple of um uh articles one that i published myself and uh a more recent paper that i co-authored about a month ago like basically the idea is of using tokens that are non-transferable right uh so the basic idea here is that like you want to be have tokens that represents like say that you actually are a member of some community that you actually like learn like a prove that you know that you know something that you have some experience you proved that you completed some challenge you want to like prove that different things about yourself but you wants to prove that like actually you were the one who did those things and you did not ",
        "11": "just like buy a token from someone else for fifty dollars and so basically making tokens that are like non-transferable so pope is um actually a good example of this right now pope tokens like they are transferable in that like they are erc721s and you can send them to someone else if you want to but like you can look on the blockchain and see right like has this pope actually been transferred um and if you like you can tweet popes that are still in their original address and and pokes that have been transferred uh differently right um and i'm basically expecting that these kinds of things are going to become used for a lot like a lot more different kinds of uh projects uh so and i think there are a lot of applications of this right so one that i mentioned is what we call soul drops like basically air drops where in order to qualify for the air drop like you you try to use some of this like on-chain information to actually ",
        "12": "figure out like who is in the community that you want to airdrop to right like a lot of different projects he wants to airdrop but one of the challenges that they always face is like if you airdrop then sometimes the airdrop just gets farmed by vcs right and vc is just create a hundred thousand accounts uh sometimes uh the air drop you just give it to random people and someone creates like a really efficient app where everyone can just like go and dump their airdrop on unit swap for 32 bucks and everyone does that and like you know you have just lost a lot of money uh so what you want to do is like i think you want to distribute your token supply you don't want to have this kind of you know plutocratic dystopia where like seven people and vc funds control have to supply but you also want to like actually give the supply out to people who are actually in your community right and so how do you tell like in a very verifiable kind of automatic way that it gives you like ",
        "13": "some of you know what we call credible neutrality some ability to like actually prove to the public that you were fair in how you allocated it and that you're not like quietly giving lots of coins to yourself um soulbound tokens might actually be a very powerful tool for doing this right so proof of humanity you can like limit to individual people um you could even like you know do interesting things with proof of humanity like you could make a sort of fair ico where if you want to uh let's say sell the you could buy your first token for one dollar but then buying your second token cost two dollars buying your third token costs three dollars and so the more tokens you buy the higher the price of each one goes right so there's like different ways to try to create these mechanisms to sort of make them you know less plutocratic and more fair um and things like proof of humanity could be a big part of it um proof of attendance protocol can be good and similar ideas can be good for ",
        "14": "not just checking like who is a human but also checking like who is actually a member of a particular community um and i think there's a lot of like good ideas here but there is a lot of room still to actually build the infrastructure to make it really easy to do these kinds of things so i think this is like you know another challenge for developers like try to actually build more of these tools um another interesting one is uh in this concept of like soul bound token gated community forums right so like imagine a private chat where it's basically things that are set in the chat they don't get automatically broadcasted to everyone but they can you know it isn't like just a couple of people who decide who gets in and who gets kicked out instead like say you have a dow um and that dao issues tokens and uh even like based on some measurement of whether or not you're in a particular community um that determines whether whether or not you can get in so ",
        "15": "this i mean obviously like soul bound tokens and zero knowledge i think like they're not separate and i there are really important synergies between them and the reason why there are really important synergies i think is obvious right because like there's a lot of really cool things that you can do just by having the ability to like know more things about the people behind the addresses that you're interacting with and being able to say like this person is from this community this person is not this person is a you know core developer of of uh this project um and uh you know this person has um you know one ethereum address but actually he is he's mostly involved in some completely separate project um in like being able to distinguish those things but the more you gain that ability the more you're like breaking people's privacy right and zero knowledge it is a great way to get some of that privacy back um so um another ",
        "16": "a lot of interesting ideas here um better public goods funding this is something that i think we've been talking about for the last two years right basically that like blockchain communities need ways to find public goods public goods are important for everyone but they're especially important in blockchain communities because blockchain communities are internet communities they depend heavily on open source software um public documentation that gets written on the internet people making translations uh just all kinds of work that's completely done in the open and it's extremely valuable but there is not a good way to charge for it right so better ways of like funding it and of like actually using um you know community pools of funds to support those things and even to support public goods that go beyond the blockchain space is something that i think is like really important to care about right now how can we do this i mean so ",
        "17": "quadratic funding is interesting so the bitcoin team has been doing these experiments for the last two years these uh quadratic funding rounds and at the beginning it was like this thing where you had like a 25 000 dollar matching pool and basically nobody cared about it but i think over time we've seen it like really grow in balloon and now it's this big i don't know five million dollar thing and you have just these really big matching pools that happen every year every couple of months which i think is amazing um but there is still like opportunities to improve quadratic funding and to try to make the mechanism better make it more um you know safe against um attacks make it more privacy preserving and all of these things so that this is one part of the public goods problem another way to look at the public goods problem is to look at it from the perspective of like credit assignment right so let's say that someone invents some amazing new ",
        "18": "zero-knowledge proof protocol and this new zero-knowledge proof protocol is like makes it let's say 10 times cheaper to scale ethereum roll-ups and improve privacy and it has some other magic amazing properties right now this is a public good it's something that once you do it it's in the open it gets published it benefits everyone it doesn't even just benefit the ethereum community it benefits you know every crypto community it goes like it could even benefit like lots of mainstream um you know industrial applications lots of government applications it can make a civil society more um applications more secure so it's a very public good um but one of the ways of like asking what the problem is is to look at it from the problem of like well who should get credit right and the answer almost never is one person right on the end because uh like it's easy to kind of tell who is like the last mile person who is responsible right like who ",
        "19": "is the guy who actually publishes the thing but the pers the person who publishes the thing like he did not invent or you know she did not invent the idea in a cave right like they read existing work uh synthesized existing work talks to people created one version of an idea found someone who broke that version of an idea fixed it created a better version of the idea there's always this collaborative process and each of the ideas that they built on are also ideas uh that um themselves um you know built on other on other ideas and like there is this big tree of uh like where the credit comes from uh so one thing to think about is like people i think have for a long time been thinking about like the kind of the providence problem right so this is like blockchain supply chain applications like people talked a lot about this in 2015 to 2017 um right like basically if you have um like if you get some product how do you tell like you know ",
        "20": "which country the different parts actually came from how do you tell like what's trustworthy can you like put cryptographic links at every step in the supply chain check them on uh check them on chain and all of that like we could do that for public goods as well right we could try to like take the concept of citations and formalize it make them cryptographic make them more incentive compatible have a kind of more this kind of richer information about them and just like have more information out there that could actually be used to properly compensate sort of everyone um all along the chain of like actually producing some public um nft is for public goods uh so like nfts have always been this sort of challenging topic for me because on the one hand like i think nfts could be like a really amazing fundraising tool and they could really help in like raising money for things that really need it and things that don't otherwise have business models right and they kind of already do there's like a lot of artists that are around the world ",
        "21": "and even people in places like you know southeast asia and africa and latin america that like really do get included and have finds a way of like making revenue through the nft ecosystem but on the other end like nfts can sometimes become this sort of ridiculous thing where people are trading three million dollar monkeys right so like to me like i guess my ideal world is like not uh like i don't want to hate nfts and i also don't want to uncritically like nfts but so like i want to build better nfts right and you know i want to it would be nice if we can like try to find a way to kind of get and make nfts benefit public goods more right so you know if you produce some like some uh public good um and then like find a way to kind of sell some nft for it and the public good like you know it could be some scientific result it could be a work of art um it could be a blog post it could be an idea uh basically ",
        "22": "find ways to kind of create an nft ecosystem that people wants to participate in but um and we are at the same time like you actually ensure that the people who get the funding aren't just kind of like very flashy and famous people at the end of the chain but try to actually make sure that sort of the entire um you know intellectual supply chain gets that compensated well so a lot of like i think interesting ideas to work on there um better dow governance uh so i think uh you know daos are great and lots of people are doing taos but at the same time like dao's have a lot of problems and governance like their governance is i in general i think it's like either centralized or attackable and like we see a lot of sometimes some pretty scary attacks right like last year i think very recently there was like a stable coin that got drained because someone bought up 51 percent of the supply of the tokens and made a governance operation to drain all the money and did that in like a flash alone ",
        "23": "in a single transaction um and the like these kinds of things like they happen because coin bait driven governance is like fundamentally broken right and i've written about this many times so this is like you know another post where i talk about this and there are ways that you can improve it on the margin but i think ultimately you need to have governance that is not coin driven um so this is also where things like sold bound tokens things like proof of humanity things like proof you know proof of community membership come in like we need to have governance that depends on things other than just um you know like token ownership and we need to like even get away from this idea that the purpose of a dow is like fulfilling the will of the token holders right there are other stakeholders that matter too uh so one of the directions to go is kind of non-coin-driven governance platforms and like i've talked about like ideas for how to do this in a couple of places but there's also the the problem of like actually building dow governance tools that use ",
        "24": "those ideas right like today everyone forks compound because there's just lots of really good tools that is that are like make dows easy to operate if you assume that your dow is a coin voting down and forks compound there aren't good tools if you want to build a dow some other way if you want to build it down some other way you have to do things yourself right and it's like you know in the last century you know we had like nobody gets fired for buying ibm or and here it's like nobody gets fired for uh forking compound right but i think more people should get fired for working compound and more people should get rewarded for like actually trying something different and so you know we have to actually build those tools and make it easier uh direction two is better communication platforms right like governance isn't just about voting voting is the last step in governance the steps that comes before is like how do you actually create ideas come to consensus on ideas even like improve ideas over time and like get feedback even before the final vote happens so that you know you ",
        "25": "actually can like better find an idea that makes say 90 of the community happy instead of just making 51 of the community happy so better communication platforms i mean there definitely are projects that are trying to kind of do this decentralized governance communication thing so i mean like radical exchange people they talk a lot about police right it's that's not a platform for kind of finding ideas that different uh self-communic different subcommunities can agree on and audrey tong from taiwan really likes it and it gets used a lot there so that's a one good example um but you can look at that and but i think there's also room for like a lot more experiments here but you know in general i think like dowsing better governance dollars need a better communication so lots of things to do here so those are just a few ideas i mean there's plenty more ideas that you can try but i think you know there's a lot of really interesting directions to work on ",
        "26": "there's a lot of very exciting uh potential in the space that exists now that did not exist two years ago but there's also still a lot of stuff that needs to be worked on and you know i hope that people here can be a part of the solution [Applause] [Music] you "
