        "1": "ways to do and of decentralized governance in a way that is uh if like fair and kind of unexploitable and open and um all of those nice things is very important thank you so uh the stage is yours cheers okay um just remind me how long do i have again uh uh you should have like 40 minutes 40. okay perfect i will go ahead oh um you have disabled my ability to share the screen um is that intentional uh yeah maybe you can try um okay um no it says host to disabled participant screen sharing um hmm ",
        "2": "so you're using the chinese version of zoom i'm i'm just using zoom mic okay um decentralized governance share okay do you see this got it okay okay excellent thank you um great then um i will start um so i to uh you know start off uh i will just uh thought i would just go through a few examples of uh some uh interesting uh things that have happened in the last year right so um these are all uh projects that are on ethereum um so at top left you have a compound a decentralized finance uh gonna collateralize lending platform uh we have a uniswapa launching the uni token um synthetics a synthetic asset platform um bottom right is a urine finance a uh a passive ",
        "3": "investment pla platform that also does some other things and one of the interesting things that's happening is that all of these projects are becoming daos in some form right uh so compound is uh rewriting their uh their protocol uh in order or designing their protocols so that there is a decentralized autonomous organization a uh smart contract that exists on the blockchain which has the ability to basically make some of changes to the smart contracts in the protocol in the case of uniswap but they released a token called uni and uni has the right to receive as 0.05 of the fee from other uh trades on the unit swap and uh the uh uniswap dow um which uni token holders can vote in um has the ability to control issuance and so they can potentially ",
        "4": "release new versions of the protocol i mean synthetics has their own transition to decentralize their governance uh urine actually is started as being a ada right from day one uh which is very interesting uh so these are just uh some examples of things inside of the ethereum ecosystem outside of the ethereum ecosystem uh so uh bitcoin cash has been seeing some debates around uh infrastructure funding plan basically there was a proposal uh for uh twelve point five percent of the bitcoin cash mining reward to be read or i'll say the block reward to be redirected from the way it currently is which is that it all goes to minors but to instead go to a group basically a development team that would hire developers to work on the bitcoin cash ecosystem and code base ",
        "5": "zcash started with 80 percent of the reward going to miners and 20 of the reward going to developers and the original plan was to switch to 100 miners after four years but um they had a series of community decisions and votes and they made an ultimate decision to continue the uh 20 of the reward going to a developer's forum in other four years right so we're seeing even and blockchains uh and even blockchains that are initially viewed themselves as being like not really having this kind of governance so you know considering and kind of experimenting with it more and more um and then finally bottom right uh this uh uh kind of attempted hostile takeover of the esteem network by uh our wonderful friend justin sun um basically uh the idea is here that uh he kind of bought um steam the company ",
        "6": "um and this basically without the kind of consent of esteemed the community and tried to you know assert control over the steam ecosystem and uh when people started voting against us some of the things that he was trying to do um in the uh dpos voting he basically used coins uh that were held by exchanges in order to vote and uh basically vote for himself and try to take over the network and this ended up being resolved with a fork uh so we've been seeing uh kind of other either blockchains that already have governance um have challenges with their governance or blockchains uh uh experimenting with adding more governance uh in the case of bitcoin cash uh the ifp is uh and currently meeting a lot of resistance um and so it's looking well it's looking likely that it'll either not go in or some kind of split will happen i'm not sure and and in z casually 20 actually was um ",
        "7": "extended and this actually happened very peacefully right so between uh projects inside of the ethereum ecosystem and between uh projects outside of the ethereum ecosystem we're seeing a lot of this experimentation with governance both around protocol changes but also very importantly around the funding happening at the same time and so we need to ask well why is this happening and i think that there's uh very good reasons why it's happening right uh so just to kind of zoom out a little bit um the largest problem that the crypto space has is uh how to fund public goods right so the crypto ecosystem like many things on the internet depend crucially on public goods on these a project where somebody does the work once and once they publish it there is a no way to kind of pick and choose who benefits from it or sell it like once you develop ",
        "8": "it everyone can access it for free and for hundreds of years there's been this known economic challenge around well what kind of mechanisms can be used to actually fund the visa public goods before the blockchain space people attempted to make decentralized projects but a lot of the time they did not go very well right so one major example of this is this uh attempted facebook alternative called diaspora it raised the 200 thousand dollars in a crowdfund at the time this was a lot of money and now of course uh you know even at 200 million dollars is not necessarily an extremely large crowdfund so you know we've seen kind of how far we can go if we just uh uh basically just add more economic and economic incentives to things but before we had uh cryptocurrency and before we had blockchains uh you know we just had these fairly small projects with very few resources they had a very hard time attracting ",
        "9": "users and so they did not go very far now bitcoin came along right and bitcoin uh the the funding model i think like maybe for the first two years it was basically a small group of volunteers and this was enough but then after that uh we've seen uh bitcoin based companies and you see in block stream there's a lot of others and a big part of what happened there is basically developers and early adopters became wealthy uh investment funds that uh held bitcoin became wealthy and so there was this big kind of cloud of wealthy actors that were all just willing to and just donate money either directly or indirectly to a bitcoin development um just because you know they were large enough that it was in their own interests to contribute some amount so this model uh can provide some level of funding but the reality is that it's still providing a much lower level of funding ",
        "10": "than uh potentially would be is required to make a and of modern blockchain ecosystem um ethereum uh and uh other blockchains uh from a 2014 to 2018 well we saw kind of one-time funding right so either an ico or a token sale or a pre mine um where some fixed a number of coins basically get printed and directly given to some centralized foundation and the mindset here is basically that you create this one-time seed funding and this one-time seed funding would be given to this organization and this organization would use the funding to develop the protocol uh it's worth noting i think that at the beginning pre-mines were very controversial right there was this uh kind of important norm the senate idea of purity this idea that uh blockchain protocol should be out of completely fair and completely pure and that having this rule in the ",
        "11": "protocol that says um you know give 100 000 coins to i know bob the core developer or give you know 200 000 coins to the ex xyz coin foundation this felt like a kind of violation of a neutrality or a violation of fairness but in a lot of cases pragmatism did win out but i think just because of this and norms existed and still does exist there was this pressure to try to say that these icos and or pre-mines are going to be only one time right so we say um at the beginning when a project has to be centralized by necessity um and uh when we already know that there are only a few core developers starting it like at the at the beginning we can just have this one time kind of violation of this norm of fairness and neutrality give some coins to this group and distribute it and then after that ",
        "12": "after launch the protocol can be completely neutral now we i think realize that this approach actually has a lot of problems right so it has two major problems one problem is that the benefit of going to the foundation or to developers is front loaded right so it all happens at the beginning and this is bad because well if there's a dishonest team that's trying to raise funds they can just get the money very quickly and they can disappear even teams that are not dishonest to start off don't really have much of an incentive to try hard to develop a good project once they have this funding this is the first problem the second problem is that many of these projects underestimated just how much work it would take and just how long an amount of time it would take to build a blockchain and how much ongoing effort they would need into the future and so there really was this idea that you could make a ",
        "13": "blockchain and finish it but it turns out that you can't just finish it watching so quickly and there is a need for this ongoing work to keep improving it so for maybe the first four years right 2014 to 18 the the one-time funding was large enough and crypto prices were rising everyone was rich and everyone was happy and so people kind of forgot about this problem for some time but then after the crypto winter and the bear market of 2019 i think a lot of projects started running out of money and this problem of how to fund things more sustainably really came to came to the forefront it really became something that a lot of people uh finally realized is a very important problem um so at the beginning of this year i wrote this a blog post on uh credible neutrality where i basically tried to describe um or interpret ",
        "14": "this principle that a lot of people have that be around like basically this idea that blockchains and potentially other systems as well um should be fair um right and the idea is that they should be designed in such a way that you can clearly see that they do not favor any specific uh specific participants right so like that you know my name is not written into the rules of the protocol as a recipient and these norms around like not having pre-mines and not giving funds to centralized foundations they come out of this principle but at the same time like that's not the only way to satisfy this principle of credible neutrality right like the one of the points that and i i made there and that i've made in a lot of other contexts is that potentially there are credibly neutral ways to solve these problems around the tragedy ",
        "15": "of the commons that normally prevents funding public goods right so can we have credibly neutral credibly fair uh public goods funding um one other thing that's worth kind of keeping in mind is that you know just if you zoom out from an economic point of view are many blockchains current approach to what issuances is used to fund just doesn't make sense right so if you look at just the ethereum network and the this year right if you look at just funding uh that's been going into a different categories of public goods there's one public good which we agree that blockchains are allowed to fund which is network security right mining and block rewards and we've been seeing billions of dollars or about one billion dollars going into block rewards hundreds of millions of dollars go into transaction fees this year um and so there's about 1.4 billion ",
        "16": "dollars i think probably more than 1.5 or 1.6 now um going into securing the ethereum network um but if we look at just the amount of funding going into research and development the ethereum foundation has an annual budget of about 30 million dollars a year other entities in the ethereum ecosystem maybe another 30 million and so there's like 50 to maybe 50 or at least 30 times more being spent on network security that is being spent on research and development and so you have to ask well does is network security really 30 times more important than research and development i think the answer is clearly no right i think the answer it's pretty clear that if we were able to just take out like say 20 of funding from network security right so it goes down from 1.4 to around 1.12 cut it down over here and take that kind of a slice and just move it over to research and development and just quadruple the amount of work ",
        "17": "going into a research and the development in the ethereum ecosystem that on net this would make ethereum significantly better right ethereum would benefit much more from a factor of four increase in research and development spending then it benefits from the last 20 of its uh spending on security so this is end of the setup right so funding public goods other than network security is very important and we need to figure out how another problem that decentralized governance is looking to solve is protocol upgrades right so uh compound has this approach toward protocol upgrades where they have this administrator address and they have the ability to upgrade the code but it has a time delay and so if the governance gets captured and it starts doing things that the users don't like the users have some window of time within ",
        "18": "which to you know withdraw and stop participating and then uniswap has a different approach uh basically if they wants to upgrade your swap they just release a new version and they just tell people to move over to it and people are free to move over to a new version the new version of unit swap or not move over to it right so uh governance in unit swap is interesting because the governance of the uni token only has one capability which is the capability to issue new units of uni uh which could be used to pay for development all right where and it has some very limited protocol configuration rights like i think you can it can adjust the fee within some range or something or something like that or maybe that's just a planned v3 feature but in general right unisop is still like despite having some governance so if you're fairly a governance minimalist and even if the governance breaks um like users can just uh decide to not ",
        "19": "uh use use some new version whereas compound it actually uses governance to do upgrades more but there are some safeguards so that users can't protect themselves so there but no decentralized governance suck why aren't we using it ever already right and i think a big part of the answer is that decentralized governance actually is vulnerable to attacks um so here's just one a fairly simple financial attack on just any coin voting based a decentralized governance system basically imagine you have a governance token right xyz xyz is a governance token so it has some economic interest um you know it it has some value the value goes up because the token collects fees because of something happening in the application and it also carries governance rights if you have xyz then you can vote ",
        "20": "well imagine someone creates a rapper contract that looks like this right anyone can deposit their xyz into the wrapper contract then when they deposit their xyz they get a wrapped token w xyz and if they have w xyz they can withdraw and then they get xyz back um and then but a w xyz does not have governance rights right governance rights are still owned by the wrapper contract because the rapper contract is the thing that holds the xyz now what the wrapper contract does is it auctions the governance power right so every time there is a governance decision that token holders need to vote on the uh rapper contract runs at auction it collects money and whoever wins the auction gets to choose what all the xyz in the rapper contract is voting for um and then the the payment from the auction against distributed as dividends and it it just goes to a w xyz holders right so ",
        "21": "look one simple way to implement this would be that um the payments uh from the auction just gets converted into xyz and then the ratio of like how much xyz you get for each one unit of w xyz just kind of goes up over time right so governance power keeps getting auctioned and holders of x y that zed that deposited just keep collecting interest so what's happening here is it's a kind of separation of economic interest and governance rights and this is very dangerous right uh the reason why this is very dangerous is basically uh because most participants uh in or most holders of xyz are going to are fairly small holders um and so they benefit fully from the economic value of their own xyz but the governance decisions that they make with their own small portion of xyz only have a small effect on the outcome ",
        "22": "and they only only suffer a small portion of the consequences of any bad outcomes that they contribute to right so if like for example there's a governance outcome that uh get that does like 100 million dollars of harm to the whole system but you only have a 0.01 percent of the xyz then like that 100 million dollars first of all like the amounts that you would lose it gets multiplied by 0.01 because you only have 0.01 percent of uh of the token but then because you only contribute 0.01 to the governance decision the your incentive to vote correctly gets multiplied by 0.01 again right so you start off with 100 million then divide by 10 000 because you have one over 10 000 of the coins and but then divide by one over ten thousand again because you have only one over ten ",
        "23": "thousand of the influence uh on the result and so your uh incen the size of your incentive to vote correctly becomes only one dollar right it becomes very tiny and insignificant and so basically almost everyone has an incentive to participate in this rapper contract um to collect dividends and then the governance power would be auctioned to a very small number of uh very wealthy participants which is not good um one thing i might add is that like this looks like it's a a fairly fatal vulnerability and the thing that i'll show here is what seems like a fatal vulnerability as well i think a big part of the reason why a lot of existing uh decentralized governance projects have not yet been attacked is because their token holdings are very centralized right like in the case of like things like maker there's a very small group of people like some of them are even investment funds that have more than half of all the mkr um in ",
        "24": "the uh case in the case of a lot of tokens like the founders and the foundation and one or two investors add up to have more than half or more than two-thirds uh so in practice like basically a lot of these uh quote decentralized governance systems that are broken in theory work in practice because they are centralized and if they were less centralized they would break i personally i like decentralization and i like things not breaking and so i'll what i'll talk about later is like can we make governance mechanisms that do not break even if they are not centralized um attack number two this is a somewhat more evil attack because it's more obfuscated and it doesn't even feel like an attack right so here's here is the attack uh so imagine you have a d5 platform so like think about compound for example or maker or something like something like this right where you can basically deposit a coin and then withdraw another coin ",
        "25": "um and you have a cdp you have this a collateralized debt position where basically like if you deposit if and you get out xyz then whenever you send the xyz back you can you can get your heath back so here is how the attack works so step one um deposit your eth and create the scdp right so uh deposit your ether into the d5 platform you and you create a cdp and then from that cdp you from that collateralized debt position you get xyz now xyz here is the governance token then so you have xyz um and so you then use the xyz to do whatever you want in circuit governance right you have native xyz you have the year states one you can go and vote after you vote um step four return the xyz to the cdp and you can recover your eth so what is interesting about this right what's interesting is that um even though you are using xyz to participate in governance ",
        "26": "you actually do not really have any economic exposure to xyz right if you use your xyz to make some governance decision which is very bad and which leads to the platform breaking then your the xyz becomes worthless but that xyz is not really xyz that you own right that xyz is xyz that you have to pay back into the cdp anyway and uh then when you pay back the exis the xyz regardless of um how much of how much money that xyz is worth you're still getting your original ethback right so basically what's happening here is we're using define lending platforms as basically an an obfuscated version of a rapper a wrapper contract so [Music] there's a lot of these attacks that we can do right that are all of pretty mean um and there's some some examples of attacks happening in practice um so the attempted hostile takeover of ",
        "27": "steam uh that happened earlier this year was very interesting um so as i briefly mentioned there the story basically is that um there was uh originally steamed the company um and esteemed the company had a a fairly large amount of steam tokens but there was this kind of understanding with the community that those tokens are not really a kind of private property those tokens are meant to kind of develop and improve the steam ecosystem and then justin sun came along he bought steve the company without have really having an understanding with uh steam the community uh and then he basically started acting as though those coins that were meant to develop the network just completely belongs to him um the community is was start was uh concerned that he would use uh these coins to us uh um to uh start voting uh because like they felt like they um they had an agree uh uh an understanding with the original ",
        "28": "owner that those coins were not were not meant to vote um but uh justin just like started tweeting those coins as though they belongs to him um and so the community kind of voted to formalize their understanding and just make sure that those coins don't have voting rights uh justin then they what he did was he based he cooperated with exchanges right like cryptocurrent major cryptocurrency exchanges binance like other ones and he used coins that other people have deposited um in order to like basically vote and uh take over the yes take over the steam network and ensure that he has all of the delegate slots and so he has a secured control and he can do what he wants um so what happened there was interesting right because if you think about coins that are sitting on exchanges right in exchange is actually like like a wrapper contract you have your xyz you deposit your xyz on an exchange um you have a balance on the exchange ",
        "29": "which is kind of like w xyz and the exchange does actually own the governance power like if you owe the exchange is the one that from the blockchain's point of view owns the xyz and the exchange sometimes even pays dividends like sometimes it pays real dividends to xyz holders and sometimes the exchange just kind of implicitly pays dividends because it provides xyz holders with a valuable service like the ability to easily trade their xyz and do leverage with it and other things like this right and then the exchange has this concentrated governance power and in this case like basically the end of exchange just like uh decided to use it to uh to cooperate with the attack um so you know this story has a happy ending and i'll get to it soon but this is just an example of how like these kinds of uh attacks that seem like they're almost kind of too evil to be true can actually be proved fairly real uh ",
        "30": "and then bribe some staking pools um so staking pools that base where you can basically deposit your coins and a centralized operator has governance power and then they give you interest these things are common in many uh delegated proof of stake systems um so these kinds of economic attacks they actually really do happen all the time right um now there is of course people who try to philosophically argue well are they attacks um is this or isn't it just like basically like things for a market activity and people selling things to um to the highest to the person who benefits most for most from them um i actually i have a post i actually have multiple posts on my blog of italic.ca where i talk about why these kinds of things that really are our attacks and why they do break the economics of these platforms if if they're just allowed to happen without restriction so these kinds of things can happen and ",
        "31": "in the long run uh these kinds of things will happen right and so and these kinds of problems are a big deal um even without attacks uh one major problem with coin voting is just that it it becomes very plutocratic um so this was a an image that was made by a critic of the dow fork about four years ago where he pointed out that one of the on-chain votes that was done to legitimize the dow fork like basically there was there were not that many people participating and the distribution of people participating was fairly unbalanced right so there's one voter who actually actually had about like 20 of uh the entire voting power uh voting power in the vote um and so now you can ask well how decentralized is it when some people have like tens of thousands of times more voice than other participants um and i argue in my blog post that i mentioned on the vitalik.ca that ",
        "32": "these problems are hard to solve right like there is very deep and fundamental economic reasons um that have to do with the difference between private goods and public goods um with kind of coordination public how public resources work um and the conclusion of this research basically is that like these are not problems that you can just solve with a very small number of tweaks right these are problems that work that are various fundamental problems and they require very fundamental solutions um so there's two kinds of solutions that i attend to a favor right so the first kind of solution is uh going beyond coin voting as a form of governance um so in the ethereum community we have been uh doing this experiment on uh git coin grants so where we were we've been using quadratic funding as a way of funding public goods within the ethereum ecosystem ",
        "33": "uh quadratic funding and once again i talked about it on my blog i have talked about it in many other places it's a form of governance that combines together out of donations and economic value with a notion of identity and counting individual contributors to try to create a more optimal and more fair result for which projects i get how much funding right so quadratic funding takes identity into account it treats a one person where i'm giving a thousand dollars differently from 1 000 people each uh giving one dollar uh these things and here we've been doing uh many rounds of the segwin grants these are some of the most recent results and it actually has been doing a very successful job of funding the public goods that the ethereum ecosystem considers to be the most valuable now one very important thing is that um these um quadratic funding and ",
        "34": "mechanisms and these other non-coin-based and more identity-based voting systems they rely on some notion of unique human identity right and there's the question of well in a blockchain context how do you even tell who is a unique human and who is not um and now there are of course centralized versions of this you know there's phone number verification there's kyc and all of this stuff but there has been some interesting projects in the ethereum ecosystem or close to the ethereum ecosystem that have been trying to do a decentralized forms of verification so there's circles which is this a coin that gives a uh a universal basic income to every everyone who has an account uh there's bright id both of these systems rely on some kind of social network kind of analysis where uh people verify each other um i recommend you and uh encourage you to kind of go out and look at both of them uh so these are both making a lot of progress and solution 2 ",
        "35": "is a skin in the game right so going back to why gov governance is vulnerable to bribes and why governance breaks the problem is basically that if you have 0.01 of the coins then you only suffer 0.01 percent of the consequences of your own decision right like your own vote um has some effect on governance but and if that effect is a negative effect then that effect is felt by all participants in the ecosystem where you are only 0.01 of them right and so the reason why this uh governance breaks is because you have this imbalance where if someone bribes you they then you get the full benefit of the bribe but you but because everyone kind of goes down together uh you only suffer a small portion of the consequence negative consequences of you voting for something bad so ",
        "36": "i told you that the stimulus story has a happy ending right so here is the happy ending the steam community came together and rebelled they made this a new blockchain called hive which is basically a hard fork of steam and what they did is they basically said um st the hive starts out with the supply being forked from like basically the steamboat chain um but then what they say is that uh stake that participated in the attack on steam uh so basically coins that voted a lot in favor of the hostile takeover were excluded with from the initial distribution so basically if you vote voted for an attack and the community forks away from the attack then your coins get burned right and [Music] and uh the hive white paper really nicely i actually cited some work that myself and some other ethereum researchers did where we talked about the concept of slashing ",
        "37": "and it kind of is similar to slashing in a lot of ways right so the challenge here is basically can we create these governance mechanisms where instead of a vote being just a vote where if you vote for something bad the con the bad consequences are felt by everyone can we turn it into something more individually accountable where if you vote for a bad decision and that bad decision leads to something bad happening to the network then you suffer but people who voted against that decision do not suffer uh and i mean prediction markets are one example of something that uh works in this way there's a large space of uh governance mechanisms that have this property um and so you know this is another kind of path uh that uh we can look into so conclusions uh so experimentation into a decentralized governance is important uh and this is because funding public goods is important funding public goods is this next big ",
        "38": "thing that the crypto ecosystem needs to really learn how to do attacks are a problem um govern decentralized governance is easy to attack um wealth concentration leading to power con situation is also a problem and we need some new ideas to move forward and we have some new ideas and i don't know welcome uh product different projects and of experimenting and trying new techniques at uh moving forward and coming up with better models so thank you thank you thank you vitalik thank you for adding these chinese subtitles which is really sweet and i personally really like the idea of quadratic funding yeah i think it's this kind of great experiments and the ethereum that makes this ecosystem really attractive so do you personally firm firmly believe that uh ",
        "39": "decentralized governance will be the ultimate states for all blockchain uh projects that's a very good question i think and there is a limit to like how much we can trust a governance system even if we really like it uh and so i think one thing that's very possible is that kind of base layer protocols um and things that are perceived to be just a very systemically importance to everything else so like for example the bitcoin blockchain and the ethereum blockchain are maybe even the only two um may end up surviving without base lawyer governance uh just because if he wants to have base way or governance then um you need to create either an imperfect system or you need to start incorporating identity into the base layer and it starts getting very hairy but uh layer two protocols um are i think the most important ones ",
        "40": "definitely are going to have a decentralized governance uh of some form um i think like a lot of these are i think a lot of these roll-up projects are going to have decentralized governance just as a way of um of uh directing the revenue that they get from like mev auctions and fees for example uh i mean we've seen that like uni has a dow uh these stable coin projects have a dowel of some form so i definitely think that uh these kinds of dowels will continue will continue to uh exist and and be developed um but i i definitely do see it as being kind of if something is very very important then it will probably have no governance or no on-chain governance and move towards stability over time if something is closer to the middle of the stack we will see many kinds of decentralized governance and things closer to kind of the top of the stack will either be daos or even be more centralized because at higher levels of ",
        "41": "the stack centralization is okay it depends on the context yeah we we're also very looking forward to seeing more progress on decentralized governance yeah and i remember you mentioned that you wish to do a presentation in chinese maybe one day right yeah so baby can i book your first chinese presentation maybe for our next event uh i mean maybe i don't know yeah thank you thank you so much okay thank you bye-bye okay foreign "
