        "5": "okay good so it's 4 35 good afternoon everyone uh students in the classroom and the audience online so it's a great honor we have uh invited metallic the electrician person who has created the ethereum to come to interview again uh to share his latest view about the merch and what's next for ethereum so I don't think I need to have a thorough introduction of vitalik so actually by being here most of you guys know him who he is but I do want to say something about vitalik so he's the creator of ethereum the first discovered blockchain and cryptocurrency techniques through Bitcoin 2011 that's when he started and that was immediately excited by the ",
        "6": "technology and its potential he co-founded Bitcoin magazine in September 2011. and after two and a half years looking at what the existing blockchain technology and the application has to offer he wrote the ethereum white paper in November 2013. and he now this is even researching team and works on future version of ethereum particles which is topic of today so uh actually uh we have no metallic for quite a few years uh when he first came to Singapore and has been frequent contributed NTU to talk to our students and under his inspiration we decided to offer this blockchain course some of you guys are taking this this third cohort of blockchain students we have educated that NTU and some of them uh previous batches done some certainly work in the ",
        "7": "in the field I hope uh by having the tech online again so we hope to inspire more uh techy person out of NTU in any way we are nine young Technological University we want to have trim we would like to share more talents in the technology space for our economy that's our main Vision so with that I'd like to uh invite uh metallic to start his uh sharing that's why I don't know okay so hello everyone good afternoon um so today I'll talk about uh the merge and um Talk a bit about what the merge is um how we got to the merge and uh you know what it means for the ethereum ecosystem but then also a bit about some of the other things that's hap that are ",
        "8": "happening in the ethereum ecosystem and particularly how some of those things matter to ethereum users right so the merge is the probably the biggest single technical change that has happened to the ethereum protocol since it started right so the merge happened in about two months ago in September and basically what the merge is is uh the last step in the transition of ethereum from proof of work to proof of stake right so proof of work is the earliest form of consensus that's used in blockchain protocols so uh proof of work is uh used by Bitcoin it's used by I mean a Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin gold and like all of the crazy or Forks of Bitcoin it's used in Z cash hopefully for now it's used in Dogecoin hopefully for now um so a lot of the older blockchains use it and the way the proof of work works is uh basically you have a large number ",
        "9": "of these computers that are running these calculations 24 7 until eventually on one of these calculations one of these computers gets a lucky correct answer and they're able to broadcast that answer along with a block which is like this object that contains some transactions right and if they broadcast a block together with one of these again like good results of a calculation then that creates a valid block they can broadcast it and it gets added to the chain now the yeah the reason why proof of work exists right is that it's there to make it artificially hard to create blocks so basically to prevent a situation where an attacker pretends to be a large number of computers and kind of pretends to control the entire history and just add a whole bunch of blocks where they control all of them and not let anyone let anyone else's blocks in right so proof of work is uh purely simple it works fairly well especially at the beginning it was very Democratic like ",
        "10": "for the first four years of Bitcoin and basically anyone could just mine like so like create blocks and get a reward of 50 BTC just by running these calculations on your computer but over time it became more professionalized it became more specialized and there it turned into the system where people are spending like billions of dollars a year creating these giant mining Farms right with these big boxes I mean like entire Factory is full of computers and just running them 24 7 trying to to create blocks to get a reward so it became a very energy and efficient system I think near the peak like well even today I think Bitcoin is using like more electricity than all of Singapore and you know I think ethereum while it was proof of work like it was better because it was smaller but it was not too much better like maybe three or four times less than Bitcoin right and uh so there's a lot of issues with proof of work right like the Energy Efficiency thing is like a really big one um and then also the facts that it is energy ",
        "11": "inefficient also means that you have to constantly print coins uh to pay the people that are running these these computations right and so there's concerns about economic sustainability there's concerns um also some issues around security like basically a lot of different issues that and these issues were why uh proof of stake started to be developed right so the idea behind proof of stake is basically that instead of making it artificially hard to create blocks by requiring people to prove that they have these Resources by basically proving that they have a computer by running the computer 24 7. we can so instead of using physical resources we use Virtual resources right so to create a block you have to assign that blog with a make it a digital signature with an account where that account contains coins that are inside of the system right so instead of the block creation being limited by physical resources how many ",
        "12": "computers you have it's limited by digital resources how many coins you have that are locked inside of the proof of stake system so you one way to I sometimes think about proof of stake is it's like simulated mining right instead of uh you know you taking dollars and using those dollars to buy a computer and then running that computer 24 7 you take dollars or and you know you buy 32 each then deposit 32ef into the proof of stake deposit contract and that's like a virtual and it gets randomly assigns the right to create a block on average about once every two months and the right to participate in making other kinds of messages in the ethereum network um so this uh solves the Energy Efficiency issue there is no or a very low amount of real resources being consumed and it improves security and as we'll see it has a lot of other benefits so getting to the merge is uh something that definitely took a long ",
        "13": "time right so uh the very first proof of stake related um thing that we made or published is this a blog post called slasher back from a January 2014 so actually yeah this was even about 10 days before the project was kind of quote officially launched in Miami right so like even from the very beginning we were definitely actively thinking about proof of stake but at the time like if you read the tone of the blog post it does not it did not say we are definitely switching to proofstick it just said fruit of steak is interesting we are exploring it here is just one idea for how some of the weaknesses in proof of stake might be addressed and this is a research Direction we'll keep going right so at the beginning there was no commitments to be proof of stake and I think also at the beginning we Asia really appreciated the Democratic aspects of proof of work that it just makes it possible for anyone to get part of the AI ether Supply because there's ",
        "14": "this mining mechanism if you have a computer you can run that can be a program on that computer and then you can get coins now in November um there's this second blog post that we published in uh 2014 on those is a code weak subjectivity which basically yeah this was a bit of a philosophical breakthrough on one of the big challenges of uh proof of stake and this was the idea basically on the topic of like how to deal with attacks where an attacker starts a chain um from some time but sometime behind the end of the year history and uh like basically tries to create a chain that looks like it's stronger than the existing chain but does this for free without consuming any resources right and so this was weird ideas around slashing came in this was like the weak subjectivity period which is basically a minimum frequency like uh a minimum number of uh or a maximum interval between like two times in which ",
        "15": "a node goes online right so like your node has to go online at least once every somewhere between one and two months right now so they're going to get the full Security benefits so it basically trying to like really understand what the trade-offs are and in exchange for these trade-offs we get a consensus algorithm that gives us like basically the same security for maybe 10 or 20 times less cost right so end of 2014 weak subjectivity then in 2015 and 2016 we started like actually working on figuring out what would a consensus algorithm that has all of the ATL properties that we want to look like and so there were a lot of like very early ideas there were a lot of simulations um consensus by batch there were a couple of papers it's uh it was a very fun era I think actually if you just like search metallic Casper FFG Twitter thread you can probably find like there was this Twitter thread I made years ago where basically yeah just detailing the history of Casper research I mean like 75 tweets and you know you can you can ",
        "16": "find some in details here so it's pretty fun um but in 2017 that was when we published the Casper FFG paper which describes like the mechanism that the actual current version of Casper FFG uses and then in 2018 we really started developments of the beacon chain um so the beacon chain is this chain over here right the blue chain at the bottom basically yeah this is a the ethereum proof of stake chain so development of the ethereum proof stick chain like the code started in 20 2018 and then at the end of 2020 the beacon chain launched right so the ethereum proof of stake chain has actually already been running for almost two years but the for the first two years it was running in parallel with the proof of work chain so the proof of work chain was still running the actual ethereum system like everyone who was using ethereum interacting with ethereum was interacting with the proof of work chain but it was still possible to deposit become a Staker get rewards do all of ",
        "17": "these things um and basically the goal was to kind of run it as a test net for two years but you know with actual real is real deposits real incentives and give people time to get acquainted with proof of stake build out the infrastructure make sure that the network is stable and all of these things right and then what happened here is basically What's called the merge which is where the part of the block that actually has like basically transactions and state and like all of the things that users care about stopped being part of the proof of workbook and started being part of the proof of stake block right so it's a very complicated procedure like people have compared it to like replacing the wings of an airplane while the airplane is flying um it's uh but so there were lots of test runs um you know it took over like lots of simulations it was done on like five different public test networks and then there was a private test happening automated literally every week for almost a year so very complicated ",
        "18": "procedure but you know finally it happened and you know it actually went well which was good um actually yeah I think most people were expecting something would break but nothing did which was great um but so like there we have her right so uh after the beacon chain launched about it one year later we just did like a simple hard Fork that added some white client features and just like was just there to test the approve of stake Chain's ability to upgrade and then the second one is the emerge that fully changes ethereum over to a proof of stake right so benefits um 99.95 to electricity consumption right so like this is like probably so let's just measure it in hash rates so this is like 600k so over here is a yeah a million uh billion so a quadrillion hashes happening every second and these are hashes that are much more complicated than bitcoin's hashes and so huge amount of electricity and then here it's like basically nothing right all it is this is just like a few thousand regular computers uh so then ",
        "19": "the consensus algorithm also has these other really nice benefits right so uh one of the ones that so this is uh technically not something that's intrinsic to proof stick right it's theoretically possible to make a proof of work algorithm that has like most of these benefits but proof of stake also gave us an opportunity to like really redesign these you can send this algorithm have it be in more sophisticated in a lot of ways and one of the things that we really put a lot of effort into is this concept of parallel confirmations right so uh like who here was familiar with the concept of like waiting in six confirmation for six confirmations or waiting for 12 confirmations like who here has had to do that before okay I see so a few people right like if you've uh used Bitcoin or ease to pay for merchant services or if you've deposited to a cryptocurrency exchange like if you generally yeah like they require you to wait for confirmations right and the reason why you have to do ",
        "20": "that in a uh sorry in a chain-based system is because in a chain-based system every block is only created by one node right and so what happens if you see a transaction it got included in one block but then after that there's two blocks that are created by bad guys right and so what they're going to do is they're not going to build on top of here they're going to build on top of the previous walk and so if you have two bad guys and they're just going to ignore your block and then a transaction that looked like it was going in ends up not going in right and so in a chain-based system you have to like wait a lot more time you have to wait until your transaction is in a block and then there's more blocks on top of it so that you can be sure enough that your transaction will get in right so that's waiting for confirmations in the ethereum proof of stake design thousands of confirmations happen in parallel all this is this concept of attestations right so instead of like kind of blocks being both containers for ",
        "21": "transactions and voting as they are in a based system in the ethereum system blocks are just containers of transactions so transactions are objects that are set by users a bunch of them gets put into each block and then at the stations where you have many thousands of them happening in in parallel every slot right so this is a period of 12 seconds so you get uh thousands of attestations within four seconds and the stations are the voting um so this basically means that like after a few seconds you already have a very high degree of security and we actually see this in the data right so uh here um is uh so this is fourth blocks right I think if you go to like etherscan.io block slash Forks or something like that um you can find a you can find this page basically yeah these are blocks that looked like they were part of the chain but then ended up not being part of the chain now usual in this case this usually did not even happen because of an attack it just happened because like oh two people accidentally uh created a ",
        "22": "block at almost the same time or one person had like high Network latency just like you know lots of different issues right and you could just see how close together they are right you have like at least five blocks within the same hour and then you have three four blocks within this hour so one block is like not basically not good enough this is post merge this is like basically all these yeah forked blocks recognized by ether's scan post merge right like basically yeah it's like seven in like 40 days right so why is that well because instead of having uh confirmations happen in series you have thousands of confirmations happen in parallel and so once one block appears you have a huge number of votes that are supporting that block very quickly and so very quickly even after what three seconds it becomes almost impossible for another block to beat this block now why do these happen at all so from what we've from the analysis that we've made ",
        "23": "so far each and every one of these situations happened because there was some problem with the block and the block was proposed delayed right so the block was proposed what was supposed to be sent at like like time T and instead that block only made it across the network at like time t plus seven or you know t plus 12 or something crazy and so a few nodes saw the block but then other nodes didn't sell the block so basically like if the blog proposer is screwed up then uh there you just can't avoid having a risk for that one slot but in every other situation the chain was fine right so better change security better chain stability it's also more difficult to attack the chain uh proof of stake also makes it easier to make future upgrades in a lot of ways and it requires a lower issuance right so the amount of eth that was being issued to pay for Block rewards was uh somewhere around um I think like a bit under 5 million a year before the merge and now it's like ",
        "24": "less than one million a year right and I think maybe like something like six seven hundred thousand a year or so and uh the and we get like a much higher level of security for that right so that's the merge right it's uh you know very complicated technical project but it's uh it has a lot of benefits um the yeah the confirmations I think are actually a pretty significant benefit to users right because as a user like exchanges can safely wait fewer confirmations like Merchants can safely await fewer confirmations like it's basically if you were waiting for like six or twelve confirmations before it might be actually safe to wait for two or three and then there was this finality mechanism where if you are willing to wait 15 minutes then you get this hard guarantee that the chain just like won't be reverted at all right so a lot of your a lot of uh very good benefits here um and you know including the things that like even regular users are going to care about right so after the merge ",
        "25": "um what are the next steps um great so a few big problems right that I think are importance to the uh users in like ethereum and in the crypto ecosystem in general and uh I think it's like importance to remember that technical problems in the crypto space are still a big deal right like sometimes people ask them you know oh why aren't there more mainstream applications yet and it's like well have you tried using uh you know like a blockchain just as a normal user right so uh like for example like I personally you know over the last 10 years have tried many times to use Bitcoin and use ether and use zcash you know used a lot of cryptocurrency options just to like pay for coffee and like and pay in person in restaurants and here are some of the problems I've had right so problem one sometimes the PS are high like last year sending a regular transaction the fee was about ",
        "26": "five dollars now it's a bit lower the fee is like somewhere between 10 and 50 cents but that's only because we're in a bear Market if there is a bull market next year it's going to be fifty dollars so problem one problem two um what happened uh what happens if my internet as a consumer doesn't work right internet sell internet is very far from being 100 reliable especially if you enter a store a store is inside buildings are made out of all kinds of different materials sometimes they you know those materials block good cell service and so sometimes you're trying to pay and just when you're about to pay hope internet stops working for one minute and you send a transaction and you're like why isn't it be ascending right so problem two um problems three you send that you send the transaction and then oh it turns out that your fee was too low and then you have to wait like 40 minutes for the transaction to get in right um problem four even if the internet works perfectly it's like the user ",
        "27": "experience is still not great right because you have to like take out your phone open your phone scan the QR code enter the amount I'm gonna pay then like wait 12 seconds wait some number some number of seconds and like eventually maybe it succeeds right so it's actually interesting like one of the things that I get just realized after trying a lot of different payments options like even the centralized wallets right like even centralized stuff like grab pay it's just like it's much less convenient than using a credit card right because like with a credit card you just tap and so like basically um there's just in in any use case whether it's offline or online like fees um user experience issues security issues people don't want to hold um you know one million dollars in a wallet where if they accidentally lose their private key um they lose their you know they lose all their money um you know like all of these things are still big problems and they're still and ",
        "28": "these problems are big enough to be completely holding crypto bad back right now why am I saying this this all sounds like bad news right now actually it's good news now the reason why it's good news is because it means that the problems with that crypto is Happy having today or might actually be solvable right because these are just technical issues like reducing fees technical issue if if we make the blockchain 100 times more scalable fees go down by 100 x done waiting for a transaction to be confirmed um EAP one five five nine actually improved that a lot already right like three years ago if you send a transaction sometimes it takes one minute sometimes it takes five minutes you know sometimes it takes 10 seconds sometimes an hour and it was like very weird and very unreliable today send a transaction almost always gets included within like two or three blocks um after the merge even like even more reliability right because uh proof of work blocks they yeah the block time is like a poisson process right so on ",
        "29": "average it was 13 seconds but like sometimes it's two sometimes it's 11 sometimes it's 59 and you know like on average when you send a transaction you on average you would have to wait 13 seconds and there's like a big long tail and you might have to wait more proof of stake is like clockwork one block every 12 seconds and so when you send a transaction on average you only have to wait six right it's a it's actually a very fun mathematical Paradox right it's like for someone Distribution on average a block comes every 13 seconds but on if you send a transaction on average you weight 13 regular block times blocks time every 12 seconds when you send a transaction on average you wait six right um but it's uh and what things have happened so that make the layer one payment experience already much better right and even more things can be done right more thing like you have more things are being done in lawyer to ecosystem so a lot of Layer Two Roll-Ups they have a pre-confirmation system um there's uh more projects trying to ",
        "30": "improve things at layer one there's uh I mean it's her so that's payment speed and then you know if we start like talking about convenience I mean we're starting to have things like stable coins and so you don't have to deal with volatility as much and I mean if one person has one currency another person wants to receive another currency you could even like you know make uis that just automatically push the payments through uniswap and we can make uniswap cheaper if we have more scalability um security issues so the wall with security problem there's this cons there's this idea called account abstraction that I'll talk about later right so basically yeah you know a lot of these things are technical issues and these technical issues can be soft right and so then the question is well you know what will the crypto ecosystem actually look like when these technical issues are solved and you know when using a blockchain actually is like basically almost as convenient as using a centralized system then I mean what things will be possible that are not ",
        "31": "possible now and uh you know I think uh obviously yeah you know the people building the actual applications will are going to have much more to say about that than we do but I think you know the answer is a lot right so stuff that we're doing to solve the big problems so dank sharding this is the big thing that's happening after uh the merge so this is the thing that a huge number of uh chords developers are like really 100 focused on making happen right now right so dig shorting is this scaling solution where the chain at where we basically add this extra type of transaction called a dateable a data transaction and a data transaction carries a large amount of data right so in one of these could carry like a 128 kilobytes and there could be a hundred more than 100 of these in each block right now you might ask well what is the point of the blockchain just carrying huge amounts of data now all the point is uh is Roll-Ups ",
        "32": "right so the most successful Layer Two protocols that exist right now uh so uh optimism arbitrum starknet scroll you know the whole family they're they are what are called Roll-Ups right and Roll-Ups are interesting because they are much more scalable than layer one they benefit from layer one's security so they're they can be as secure as layer one but um the thing that roll the the one trade-off that Roll-Ups have to make is for every transaction a user makes Roll-Ups still have to put a small amount of data on chain rollups have to prove that a small amount of data has been published and that if anyone wants to download it they can download it right um basically yeah to prevent what's called Data availability attacks where someone you know makes a uh a bunch of operations in that roll-up but then doesn't actually publish the information for what they did and that kind of like prevents a lot of users from being able to do anything with their account right so it turns out the data availability ",
        "33": "attacks are the severe fundamental problem and Roll-Ups just like publish a small amount of data so an optimized rollup could publish like I think about 23 bytes per uh transaction it depends on the use case so like for a money use case you could do 16 bytes for like more complicated ethereum stuff 23 bytes if you want to be privacy preserving 48 right but if you're a small amount data on chain per transaction and by doing that these uh Roll-Ups could enable a much higher amount of transactions per second that's limited only by the amount of data bandwidth available so Roll-Ups exist today but they just used regular chain data today with full dank sharding the goal is to have 16 megabytes every at 12 seconds right so that's uh 1.3 megabytes per second and then if you uh you know divide that by 23 you're going to get like somewhere between 55 and 60 000 transactions a second and then this number can increase even more in the ",
        "34": "future right so why does the there's like really um fascinating and cool math involved in making the eggs trading work like one of the challenges with uh a lot of like making chains high performance and high throughput in general is that you end up putting a lot of pressure on users that are running nodes right a basically so if you look at some of the more centralized blockchains and how they work they generally just like say oh we're only going to have 300 nodes and they're only going to run in like big servers and only a few people do it and most people don't want to know it and most people don't need to care right and so basically they just kind of surrender toward being mostly a centralized system in ethereum we do not want to do that and we want running a node to be very accessible and so instead there's this technique called Data availability sampling which is this kind of collaborative verification idea right basically yeah every user randomly chooses a small portion of the blog and ",
        "35": "they verify that that portion of the block has been published and there is kind of fancy eraser coding polynomial math that basically means that like if more than half of a block is available you can regenerate the entire block and like basically you know every single node that will be connecting to the network would be downloading a little bit of data and would be participating in verification and then to actually verify computations these Roll-Ups would be yeah I mean I think we're going to see more ZK Roll-Ups over time so they'll just use snarks right which are just cryptographic proofs you verify one proof and that you verify that like a huge amount of computation that has a particular results was done correctly so a lot of very fascinating math but the result of this basically is that we have these Layer Two protocols that sit on top of blockchains that should be able to process many tens of thousands of transactions a second so much more than today right so roll-ups so account abstraction this is the other really fascinating one right basically yeah ",
        "36": "this is there to solve this other problem of wallet security right so the wallet security problem is pretty simple right it's like okay you know imagine if we completely solve scalability and then you know yay every time you send a transaction you don't have to send five dollars you don't have to spend five dollars on a fee you only have to spend like three cents okay you know 20 transactions later you've uh you know you saved 99.40 amazing but then one day you're um you know you accidentally slip and fall while running um on top of a bridge and your phone uh drops down into a river and you know you never find your phone again and you'll lose your private key and a hundred thousand dollars gone right so you know things like this happen to people there's uh hundred thousand dollars is nowhere near the top of what people have lost right so accounted security is uh a very big deal and uh this is like one of the really uh important uh topics for crypto ",
        "37": "right because uh one of the arguments that like people who prefer centralized finance and like send like more centralized web applications tends to make is like oh users cannot manage their own keys and so we need to have centralized institutions manage people accounts because uh if you lose your accounts you should be able to like go call the centralized institution and they can go and recover the account for you right now by the way I actually think that like this one of the reasons why this argument is overrated is that like actually the centralized institutions suck much more than advertised right so like I've had lots of friends who have lost Gmail accounts because they forgot their password or for like lost Twitter accounts because they forgot their password they go and contact support and they just get nowhere like sometimes they only get their accounts months later and sometimes even only because like I personally poke people to poke people right so uh you know very nice and very egalitarian system right so what does okay so what does account ",
        "38": "obstruction do basically the idea is that you have these two extremes right one extreme is like you only have one key and that one key is always with you on your device and your security does not depend on anyone but if your device drops in a river you're screwed The Other Extreme is like coinbase manages everything but um you know you have to trust coinbase you have to trust coinbase to like actually be good with recovery and you have to trust coinbase to um you know not get ordered by the government to seize your funds and you have to trust coinbase uh no this trust them in a lot of different ways right and so you know you have these two extremes where one is just kind of not like really not enough security for normal people and the Other Extreme is just like a huge amount of centralization right and the what the way that I think about account abstraction is opening up the entire space in the middle right so one example of this is uh what I call a social recovery wallet right so here's how a social recovery while it works you ",
        "39": "have your coins that are in an account but that account is not just controlled by one key that account is controlled by a smart contract right a smart contract is just you know a computer program on chain the same kind of thing that you use to build applications right and that smart contract has these rules there is a key and that key has the ability to assign and send transactions but then there is also a list of Guardian keys right let's say there's a list of seven Guardian keys and if five of those Guardian Keys agree then they can change the main signing key right so the theory would be that like these seven Guardian Keys you could have some of them um you know in a piece of paper at home some of them could be institutions some of them could be your friends some of them you know could be family members in uh different places right and so if you lose your key then you just like basically you know call up your friends and like get them to help recover your account and you know they know who you are and they're not gonna like wait for three months and uh do nothing because ",
