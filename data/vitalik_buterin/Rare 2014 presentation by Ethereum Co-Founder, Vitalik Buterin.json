        "0": "instead of having a contract that's backed by a legal system you would put money into a magic box and that magic box will just automatically move the funds over to me if I do what I need to do and refund them of the funds back to do otherwise in this sort of natural state of affairs in individual incentives and we collective incentives are absolutely fissile misaligned so in theory the smart contract is not going to be necessarily controlled by anyone it's not going to be capable with my I Nev I do although we would just sort of sort of sit there on the whole thing which is process automatically now we're talking about really an economic concept behind behind cryptocurrency and digital content essential we're going to talk about some of them some of the really interesting underlying underlying economic motives behind some of some of these ideas that we're putting forward we both we all don't like to think about Bitcoin as a sort of revolution in economic paradigms we like to think we like to think about this idea of this grand history of money ",
        "1": "where initially we had a commodity money then so something like gold then we moved on to gold certificates then finally we move on to young currency and maybe just maybe before it might be in the next revolution in this one on a theory evolution where we'll have US currency that's not only not backed by anything it's really not tied to any kind of entity whatsoever it's money that's sort of just is without meaning almost without any of your justification but what here's a big point worth anyway it's just us a bunch of bytes floating around you know net with no intrinsic value and yet it's got a value or twenty dollars but really this has been met then we talk about these concept like smart contracts we thought this idea that you can have these self-enforcing contracts with that we are instead of having a contract it's backed by a legal system where you sit where you say I agreed to do this and if I don't do this at all then you can sue me instead you have this sort of self-enforcing smart ",
        "2": "contract we are you can make instead of you paying me something to do that to do a sort of utter you would put money into a magic box and that magic box will just automatically move the funds over to me if I do what I need to do and refined them of the funds back to your device so this idea of sort of contract said allow for a completely self executing legal and direct interaction and then and these gweal allows entire segments of the economy to be automated so we talked about these are really interesting almost utopian concepts we we talked about this a centralized autonomous organization is jurisdiction with entities floating around somewhere in the cloud nobody really and yeah at the same time that I've been making have control over resources I can have entire departments they can have how to control over thousands and thousands of machines and incentivizing millions of people around the world and then finally repent and then the joke is you know what isn't this going to create Skynet well the ",
        "3": "interesting thing is in all these new innovations there really aren't any new philosophical paradigms that are being made pretty much everything that we've done in the Bitcoin space has already been done before so first off like that I talked about how really get down to the basics in unto the basics of how in traditional societies work so in general there in economics and in game theory there's this concept called the prisoner's dilemma so in a fruitless scenario in a prisoner's dilemma basically is that you have two prisoners they're stupid two prisoners are both being interrogated in separate groups and they were both involved in committing sub projects and the investigate the investigator doesn't really have you get too much evidence either way so the choice that the investigator gives to them the post of those prisoners ACCC says well you can either write out the other guy or you can say silence so if both of the brothers stay silent then the investigators not going to have any evidence both of them go free if both of the e of prisoners rat each other out then the intensity is going to have lots ",
        "4": "of ends both of them go to jail however if one of the prisoners stay silent and the other prisoner rats them the first one out then the prisoner of the road that wraps the second one out but we easygoing for you but he's also going to get a bit of a reward and one of the silent is were really long time also because we tried to cover up his ass so what is this create you guys should create two very interesting paradox because the collective interest for prefer the two prisoners is obviously for both of em to stay silent and propose for both of them not to reveal any information about each other so the fundamental freedom let's wipe a ID from the perspective of one of them one individual prisoner let's suppose prisoner prisoner bead is going to be on it was gonna stay silent prisoner a 50 Chiefs he's gonna get a reward and he's going to go for you if you stay silent then you just gonna go for it now suppose prisoner a is gonna rap you know and out then the choices will hits the assignments and go to jail for a real long time or you can brag about the other prisoner out and go to ",
        "5": "jail for just a long time in both cases the individual incentive is in the exact opposite direction and in game theory versus concept of a Nash equilibrium basically what is a stable state of the system what is the state of this game because that we're no player has the intent appreciation of strategy and as it turns out the only Nash equilibrium is the one is the one where both prisoners rat each other out because neither neither prisoner has have the incentive to deviate from that situation and as a result is unfortunately the worst possible outcome possible so really right so the interesting thing about prisoners dilemma is that you can actually think of it as a model for this varietal or life in general so you know ten thousand years ten thousand years ago if you imagine a bunch of people you know marauding around for Horace look gloves and no there's a there's a lot of ",
        "6": "opportunities for two people to interact with each other and at some point you know a person a and person B okay would go through to them go up to each other and you know we don't have an option both of them would have cadet the option to either peacefully trade or either of them has an option to kill the other in there so you can take all that stuff so reserves dilemma once again both of them peacefully trade plus three plus three one of them it was the other guy with a club he wins other guy loses worst possible scenario of all both of them to each other for each other with their clothes so this is what's called the Hobbesian chuckle equilibrium in this sort of natural state of affairs in individual incentives and the collective incentives are absolutely disel misaligned and so in unfortunately people creating all performing very individually rational choices results in the worst possible outcome privately white doesn't actually British in short so here's the nature sick solutions that particular problem where you we had this ",
        "7": "conference concept of punishment what if there was some a way for some of the players in this system to do stuff to do something say to them to take some small note of effort and actually and actually punished certain groups of people so this could be some light amount of light amount of punishment like burning their hide it's a preview something more severe like I should actually get down with a club there's a really matter so but the anything as I said it's some action which is not really but my itself not beneficial to anyone at all if I'm one of these Punishers and I end up and I end up burning your HUD you know that's that's going to be a bit a lot of a cost it's an effort for me it's even risky for me and then for you you're gonna lose your hunt and then if it's nobody but why do we punish the answer is it changes the incentives so any changes you and it changes the incentives so that if you you're a cheater and you don't be smaller trade and instead you always try to be gained your advantage in every single situation instead you're going to ",
        "8": "get punches coming after you and the situation for you is not going to just be bad for everyone it's also getting bad for your specific way so as long as these Punishers exist the incentive is for everyone to cooperate and so we have a second paradise this act of punishment this process as theoretically harms everyone ends up radically improving the situation but the problem is not yet solved here's the thing why would anyone be one of these punishes what's the incentive to participate in the system and so here is a clever solution and this is basically what I would argue the first so in the first great solution of civilization recursive punishment you say that the process the process of punishment is itself back in itself and for spice a sort of second order punishment yes you have a group of furnitures if they do not participate in it in punishment then there has to be some kind of second-order punishment or a replenish that but then okay you have second order but it punishes that you need third order punishes to make sure ",
        "9": "that those pleasure is also punished so hey is it that's it a bit of recursion problem well that's what your here's what we do we we say that it's the ski exact if everyone is required to participate in the punishment process and in some form directly or indirectly and not participating in the punishment process is considered to be an offence on the exact same level as the original crime itself so the punishment is recursive the exactly mechanism doesn't level 1 level 2 level 3 all the way up to level infinity minus 1 and so the whole set the whole system closes itself and it works so sounds pretty brutal well turns out that's how are you pretty much every legal system works in practice take the example of the tax-funded police so this is how it's a somewhat somewhat common negatives in person securing you know cities and civilizations basically you have a bunch of people running around ",
        "10": "with clubs or more more sophisticated substitutes and if you do something that likes to know what you're killing then these people come at you and like it with a club maybe put you in a cage now the problem being problem is though is that why would these people do that well guess what they did those people are professionals they're paid salaries and everyone has everyone has to pay taxes and if you do pay taxes then you come out come after with a combinatorial a cage so that's what what that's one solution the other thing is that the exact same mechanism is also implemented in this concept of social ostracism so much work you're being approached but uh ok on a choice you made approach but it's actually the exact same principle so if you look at a lot of the different traditional societies and especially societies that are in and vanity inside of other societies especially if you look at some gypsy gypsy cultures if you look at some groups that are living on living under external external government's that are ",
        "11": "sort of from foreign groups and the legal systems that we tend to have are basically consists of the social ostracism mechanism so the rule is is that if you if you break one one of them you can break any communal rule including this one that you have to that you get ostracized so if you break a rule you get ostracized if you do we ought to shut ostracize someone who breaks a rule and you get occupies if you don't ostracize someone who doesn't oxidize someone who breaks a rule you also get ostracized and you know we were person punishment it works except so occupation is a very interesting one so here is the interesting thing about this pots up reputation so in general the way reputation where reputation actually works from an economic standpoint is that let's say I have a I have some reputation let's say I have a radiation that's worse some of them some amount of money as a businessman let's say fifteen ",
        "12": "thousand dollars so with us it what does that mean it means that because of my reputation people check people trust me and so I get I have an opportunity to get better has better business dealings that would presumably be fifty thousand dollars more profitable than if I was just some random anonymous person so what does what this is actually giving you it also means that I have this sort of this sort of strange social social asset and if I do something to lose that reputation let's say I get into a business dealing with someone at night and I cheat them and they lose them so if I enter a business reputation relationship with someone because I have this reputation reputation I have the incentive not to cheat not to keep them I have you I have the incentive to act on a suite and they know that and so they're and so they're willing to trust me with up to fifty thousand dollars more so next one so here's an interesting puzzle does kidnapping ",
        "13": "reputation sounds it seems obvious well what's actually economically analyze it suppose that ideas so let's say you to kidnap let's say I have a reputation it's worth playing thousand dollars and let's say society has a rule that if you kidnap people your reputation drops by ten thousand dollars it's a basically an incredibly crude approximation but you know a this is an imperial and we have to approximate everything is a number somehow so let's see what happens okay i kidnap my reputation job by ten that my by ten thousand dollars I have one fair deviation love the words so that means that I have I know how the incentive to just achieve in any case that I have an opportunity to get away with somewhere in between ten and twenty thousand dollars other people build that so therefore other people realize that I'm not trustworthy with any kind of business dealings in that range and so I'm going to be able to get with me with to get less business relationships out of this reputation and so it's worth less everything all all new we put ",
        "14": "together now suppose that we have a rule that get other people as it is perfectly okay in that place it doesn't reduce her reputation at all so okay i kidnap someone why are you patient still work the exact same amount and yet ever see it and so I still have to basically have the exactly tax a reputation other people having to meet end up the trust me in the exact same contexts and and so everything is exactly as it was before both of these situations are surprising once it is are equally economically valid that's the issue and here's the end of the more fun part it's also equally economically valid have a rule that says it reduces your reputations and the kidnapped people on Tuesdays but not on Thursdays it's also economically that way to say it reduces your operation your reputation so we keep your business on open on Saturdays but not on want to be to Friday see you see where that example comes from it's exactly how to do so it works ",
        "15": "so next step so here's we move on to the next topic this is a very interesting island I call gap somewhere around around the Philippines and on an island after using is still in suraíh a sparsely so you might think okay people are using rods as parenthesis so you know they must be just treating treating rocks storing them privately in there in treasure chests know if that's not how it works here's the problem these rocks there's something like between two and ten meters tall you can't really move them around the stones always stay in the exact same place so how does ownership change the answer is ownership changes just based on collective agreement if the village a wants to trade with village B then the only Jay agrees to transfer ownership of this particular rights knowing everyone knows that the transaction took place and so everyone everyone knows that the ownership changed so therefore the ownership changed here's some interesting ",
        "16": "properties of this particular mechanism at one point there was actually a tribe that managed to bring one of these rises that was trying to bring one of these rice towns over from another Island but unfortunately the bodhi collapse in the middle of a trip and the rice don't got dropped to the bottom of the ocean so here's the thing the rice that was at the bottom of the ocean people still knew that it existed therefore he people were still using that rice though as if it was valuable people were still trading it people are still recording the ownership of this rice thought it was good and it still had a value just like all the other stones he study number two Germans at some point invaded and maybe one of the locals basically to help them build roads at first the look was said hey why do I want to I want to go to vote for you real question asked right I mean if I were to ask you to vote for me right now we should do it okay but that's if you like on one knee going over here ",
        "17": "yeah so just so think so then the German society decided okay we have to do something about this and so leeks everyone on the next week they decided that the Germans would go to all these rice those you would mark all of them with an ax guess what all over with got no whiskey our and logos finally submitted Emily cooperated the German sets and other people out who in the access often stones and always good interesting isn't it so people without the people value the sanctity of your model your monetary system survival they allowed it to be used against that as a view over exploitation theoretically they couldn't these yeah presidents could've easily just clean the excess off themselves and yet they did the show is here that have the power of consensus mechanisms sliding so another interesting study in this whole Anatole areas moving back to this concept of trust and reputation so this is something called a koala Network ",
        "18": "it's a pretty popular a floral mechanism of international money transfer so here's how it works you're a koala Network consists of basically individuals with own koalas ours each of them located in some particular City each koala tour has a credit relationship with some set certain set of other kilometres now not every koalas are knows every other koalas are its and now it's a network is a distributed network some of them are three or four hops apart there's a concept in at six degrees of separation where in theory any two people in the world that are connected at all where am i with the exception of like completely actuated tribes or at least six opposite party hello a network is probably even worth other ways so let's say I mean you tell me and I want to transfer money to my friend in Amsterdam and I want to use a whole network say it's five dollars here's what I do first of all I go to South Pole and going to Delhi and I tell them hey can you help me move money over to Amsterdam so the guy you tell me about some research and he says oh I have another who wallet or Dino in ",
        "19": "Calcutta let me ask him oh well let me tell the planet turns out to those some weather koalas are in Berlin and then the lateral walls were when happen to know someone answer them so here's what happens suppose that before the first of all the customer sends to the koalas are and you can you tell me five dollars now that world review Kelly says okay before IOH you the koalas are in Kolkata five dollars since I'm transpired transferring you five dollars I now owe you nothing one of them says okay hawala turn and and Monday you all would meet here only five five dollars rather right it's a very good somewhat backwards so the you you'll be fine five dollars now you don't you don't know we find our super bag that gets cancelled and finally the hawala touring and Berlin's on Sakhalin tour in Amsterdam that's what I do no longer ",
        "20": "only three helpers I know what we do two dollars and so would be through this sort of multiple of debt transfers what happens is if you look at a whole of the state of the system and you add everything up what happens is ultimately it's at the wedding in Delhi lost five dollars and the walls were Amsterdam between $5 and then so a twelve-hour Amsterdam would presumably allow the guy's friend and Amsterdam to take you on five five dollars I would - - whatever he so the idea is that you use this sort of credit network to move money around the world without ever actually moving money so just the fact that you can move money around the world without moving money should tell me something about what the nature of money really is excellent so this is where we get to the somewhere so a more technical back background behind this concept the Bitcoin component you cryptocurrencies really the thing that started it all is this concept of public key cryptography so a wiki cryptography you know we all know we all know the concept of RSA basically modular exponentiation is easy ",
        "21": "but inverting the process is hard unless you know how to factor is a particular number so you take - two large prime numbers community those are your secret key and then you multiply them together and that's your public key you can publish the public key out to the world and people can use the public key to encrypt messages that only you can decrypt so what's the benefit of that well basically it's pretty obvious you publish your public key anyone can send you encrypted stuff that you can decrypt without you having never had have had any kind of prior communication the other interesting application of that over is actually signing so signing the general I ETA is a use the exact same group exactly in photography I publish a public 2-year I can sign a message for the private key and that produces a number of called a digital signature and you can take them to the number the message have the public to you and you can actually you can actually use use that as a and see that that's approved ",
        "22": "that I'm the one that actually made and send up and take your message so then after that and that's nineteen seventies in the nineteen eighties we have this concept of a patch so David Shaw created this really clever protocol on blind siding so the idea of blind siding is that you have this function called blinding and the idea is that I have a number I can blind the number pass the blind to cover over to some anthony the anthony consigned the blighted number i can unwind the number and signature and i get the signs over so we anthony was able to sign a number without even only mode of what it was signing what's the point of that full I don't even see what's on it - so here's the protocol if I wants to create create a code I basically generate a random number I've lined it I send it off to the bank the big signs the number in exchange for one dollar fee and essentially the sign that we're back now with one blinds the number I have a size Melbourne now what ",
        "23": "do we do with it I just send it to send it to someone say I want to buy an apple from you I say I sent this number to you give me the other then if you want to redeem your dollar what you do is you just show your original feed you show the unwinding some signs number to the bank the big checks if it's sign it sign the number before if you did that okay the bank gives you one dollar back - a fee so the benefit of this is that you have this financial system that allows for pretty much total privacy including privacy against the central bank that's running the system so you know that's pretty powerful but if you have a grid of this before it's making this may even seem impossible you know you have a centralized system where you also have total privacy against the only central party problem so what's the problem for system there is central bank so any of these game 99s chemo on one of these protocols never really took off because there was ",
        "24": "a need to have this sort of central entity overt overseeing the whole thing and the infrastructure requirements some of the legal requirements are around that it's unfortunate we pilot may that will mean the whole thing really impractical until and would eventually highly secure payment systems like dean allen credit cards took over and yeah and that's pretty much all the we call that we had instead all the way up until we came along so but then before that there are a few other concepts that we need to talk about as well so there's this idea of smart contracts so we talked about this before about some what so it's normal contract is I agreed to pay you $300 if you do task asks if you do X and I don't need you 300 hours but then what are you gonna do you're gonna go and complain to the legal system and the legal system is good after the higher the bed the heavier other co-op which are which are funded by taxes which themselves fund is funded by a ",
        "25": "protocol and so forth quick you get the idea so the smart contract is a bit of a different approach it says I put 300 dollars into a magic box and this magic this magic box ultimate will automatically automatically send it send the money out if you perform tasks X if you do it for 4 times X then you bullet said the money up so in theory the smart contract is not going to be gonna be necessarily controlled by anyone it's not going to be controlled by yeah I Nev I do also know we would just sort of sort of sit there and the whole thing which is processed automatically so you know want to be interesting about projects we actually had at the hackathon there is a guy who wrote 'i really that was trying to basically create a house with walks that were automatically tied to an etherion contract and the idea there would be is that if you want to rent out your house for a week all you would do is you would you would send a message through the ",
        "26": "ethereal contract that says ok for the next week this private thing is allowed to open the doors and then that would happen and it will automatically give that that particular person the right to open the doors they were thick with the house for exactly one week at the end equal exactly would immediately expire oh we wanted really automated and we don't need for human involvement so I do eight tasks X whatever you do it would be it sort of cryptographically Perot one thing so for example something like I mean something like cracking the password to a hard drive or solving some difficult mathematical problem the sort of thing you can be actually have a computer evaluate to see was a success no not often enough however that's not really possible so for something like an employment contract or something like it see where were to say area or sending a product you can't really want to be figuring out the data of whether or not a certain task was completed and that projects do an interventionist is still required you do need some kind of a legal system but the products in smart ",
        "27": "contracts up to possibly bring is basically this idea of opening up to opening it up to a market so in a system like PayPal for example you know there's this concept of chargebacks where if a consumer is unhappy with a product that makes that merchants defrauded them then they can see we could ask has to get the money back and the worse if you can test that and if the word you can test there's an arbitration process oh the money transmitter and PayPal the arbitration service are bundled together with this concept of support contracts the promise is what if we can unbundle them but if we can separate out this concept of infrastructure and this company's concept of the arbitrator so I so another important thing that in the 1990s there's this other concept of rules engines so this is just a centralized system that with us internally in companies it could be used by something like Amazon it can be used by some by some building businesses won't need any kind of chronic shipping and the idea is you have software that automatically implement certain rules ",
        "28": "and that software would would basically check you know is this condition that it's a condition that you know did the customer and was and was the product produced and is it time and is it time to do this person or thing and so and ship the product it would send the command the command process automatically that was sort of yeah so it's sort of like needs a very similar idea to those concepts hard contracts where you can sort of plug in generic generic code generic rules and which are the rules we just sort of automatically execute themselves but the thing is that all these was executing themselves it was still dependent on the rules being encoded in some kind of physical property so another important thing is here we get to a big somewhat a bit closer to in Bitcoin itself so we talk a lot about this Byzantine consensus problem so the idea is how can some number some number of nodes that don't necessarily trust each other ",
        "29": "figure out exact the basic we come to a consensus on some particular value so originally it was called the Byzantine cannibals problem because it was accurate you're a Byzantine generals involved and the question was should we retreat or should we attack so two possible messages well as it turns out if there are three generals then the problem is unsolvable so here's the basic proof so suppose that the one that initiates the process we can call them the commander and the community could be honest that the commander is honest and the commander is going to provide two equivalent messages than the other two people so those two messages would say in this case are both attack one of the attendants is this or this so but this one is lieutenant is going to reply back with the message the one saying retreat there's a second scenario the commander is dishonest man resists honest commander wants to screw the whole thing up so the commander is gonna tell wonder what's have the other one to retreat obviously you know with happy army attacks if it'll lose and then once you need the first half of you are gonna charge a charge and how do you beat the second half of the army and you're done so in this particular case attack ",
        "30": "retreated lieutenant to was on it until we tend to just just repeat the message retreat now notice what happened in these two particular cases piece one where tenet one here is attack from the commander retreat from lieutenant to cage to the lieutenant's year's attack to the commander retreat from was into there is no way for the lieutenant and tell the difference between these two cases so in this con in this environment that was we're calling moral messages and messages are a central point from her be to be without any kind of authentication there is no way to solve them as a team all tolerance problem after the number of traders is at least a third of the total participants however once you're allowed to introduce sign messages so here's a cryptographically total signatures the table becomes trivial that's actually an important point something that'll get back to so next ingredient this concept of so in JavaScript so what JavaScript basically you know before JavaScript this is you know we if ",
        "31": "you look at the early internet we have this each just HTML HTML is a protocol with lots of features you can do paragraphs you can do italic so you can do you can do buttons they can do radio buttons you can do forums that automatically send yet all these different features but then so you can do a whole bunch of stuff but you can't but there's still limited of the number of things that you can do 23 features you can do 43 different 646 feature to give you 46 different things and so forth so regret did I came up with this let's have a programming language on the Internet instead of how they want the features ot and practice I want to feature this whole daily more of it alongside lots of features let's have a generic programming language inside the Internet where that programming language allows people to just write whatever they want if you whatever kind of feature you want to just write it in your programming language other processes automatically thanks for that you know we have Gmail we have facebook we have Bitcoin wallets on top of the internet so it's just so this is really so it's things like that ",
        "32": "thanks to this concept a returning typically programming language that we really have habits I know these these were responsible for the internet that stands today being so powerful it's generalization excellent so next one is this close up of Hashcash and in vacuum 1996 so this was a system that's abused in origin we intended to make sending it that basically fights pale if you want to send an email and what you would have to do what you have to do is you would have to soul this sort of cryptographic puzzle find that you have to find a number such that the hash of the message plus a number has certain properties and the idea is that the hash is a sort of a it's a sort of River pseudo-random function its function it returns pretty much random outputs for any indistinct inputs and so there's no weak sort of trying to intelligently to grow when we solve the problem is what are we to just keep on trying different numbers and so what works so let's say the condition is that the message and that the value of each of my sex has to start with n zeros so in the ER t 9z rose then ",
