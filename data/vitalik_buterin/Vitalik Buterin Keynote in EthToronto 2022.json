        "0": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so today what i wanted to talk about is some of the stuff that's going to happen in ethereum over the next couple of years but also talk about it from the point of view not just of like what's going to happen with the technology but also from the point of view of like what does this actually mean for people and who are building things on ethereum uh so what probably the biggest news this year right is uh the merge is coming uh so the merge is uh so ethereum switched to proof of stake this effort that we have ",
        "1": "been working on for basically the last um eight years right so the first uh on blog post that we wrote about proof of stake was uh in back in january 2014 and in the years since then a lot of research has happened in uh 2017 2018 we converged on what we call the beacon chain today the version of proof of stake that we ended up actually implementing um one and a half years ago the beacon chain was actually launched and so pretty soon uh what's going to happen is um this complete switch where ethereum finally switches over to being a pure proof-of-stake system and basically what happens there is um the ethereum's application layer so the applications the smart contracts balances everything that happens happening inside of ethereum is going to be automatically moved off of the proof-of-work chain which will basically just like ",
        "2": "stop being functional at that point and move over to the improved state chain right so after the merge ethereum will finally become a proof stake system yay so now the merge is um only the first step in this fairly long and complicated roadmap that we have right so after the march there is a bunch of other things that we have planned on focusing on but probably the biggest focus immediately after the merge is going to come on scalability right so scalability is also a problem that we've been talking about we've been complaining about we've been thinking about how to fix pretty much since the beginning of the ethereum project and uh even before the chain launched them all those years ago um and it's uh something where we've been actively thinking about it there have been a lot of groups that have been actively developing solutions and there's a lot that has happened over the last couple of years in the layer 2 space in particular right so ",
        "3": "some of the roll-up projects so projects like optimism arbitrage uh you know zk sync loop rings roll starfide time you know this big long list of uh things is uh exists now um and that's uh that's something that did not exist at all um you know three years ago and it's just made a huge amount of progress over even the last year right but there's even more work on scalability lots to go so people who have been following the ethereum core development process might have heard of prototank sharding so this is this one of the next big eips that is in the process of development and is coming to ethereum after the merge so basically the goal of prototake sharding is to create what we call these data transactions that have these data blocks and the point of this is to just increase the capacity of the ethereum chain to hold a much larger amount of data right and there is this very nice ",
        "4": "synergy between these data blobs and the layer 2 roll-up projects because roll-ups can are very good at scaling transactions but they need some space to put their data and expanding the blockchain's ability to hold more data that these layer two rollout projects can use is exactly um what of rotating sharding is about right now prototype charting as you can tell from the name it's only the first step right so after prototake shorting there's going to be a second step which is just called dink sharding and take charting will massively increase the number of these data blocks that the chain can hold but so that's the long-term roadmap right the long-term roadmap is to basically increase the amount of data that the ethereum chain can hold up to somewhere around 16 megabytes every sale right and today the average block is only about 80 kilobytes so i'm massively increasing the amount of data that the ethereum chain can hold um and it's done over the ",
        "5": "next a couple of stages prototank charting is the first stage and even prototank sharding by itself is going to be a big improvement over how much data the ethereum chain can hold today now at the same time as improving how much data the ethereum chain can hold there's also another effort that's happening at the same time which is improving how much data roll-ups use right so this is uh so data compression in roll-ups this is uh something that i've talked for a long time about as something that really needs to happen uh basically trying to pack a much larger number of transactions into a much smaller amount of space so that like we just get um you know a big scalability gain for free right we can pack more transactions without really having to spend more resources at all uh so this is just a that's a chart that i published about a week ago that kind of shows the different stages and like how much you could do right so a transaction by itself and this is an ",
        "6": "erc20 token transfer takes about 188 bytes and if you add the different forms of compression so taking out zero bytes gets you down to 154 bytes i'm doing some signature aggregation takes it down to 128 making a stateless compression even better 75 and then even more advanced compression that kind of where the decompression algorithm can look into the chain and look into the history you can go all the way down to 23. right so there's like a lot of this work is work that's actually started to happen so a couple of months ago um optimism actually implemented a zero byte compression um and erc 4337 is also an effort that's been really picking up steam more than over the last couple of months right so a lot of effort to help the ethereum chain hold a lot more data and a lot of effort to help every individual transaction in a roll-up use less data so we're talking about ethereum over the next couple of years being able to process a much larger ",
        "7": "amount of transactions than it has been able to before right so what do these two things mean for ethereum right so these are not the only two technical upgrades that are happening to ethereum but there's probably the two most important ones right but you know what what does this actually mean for ethereum from the point of view of someone using it or someone building on it uh so starting off with the merge right so the merge is going to happen first so ethereum's energy consumption will be reduced by more than 99.9 percent [Applause] yeah so um you know it's a big improvement um obviously um in addition to this there's a bunch of ways in which room stay can improve security um and also the merge opens the door to more upgrades right so ",
        "8": "at the same time as being a switched from proof of work to breast stake it's also an opportunity to kind of take some of the ideas that we've learned over the last like eight years and use that to really redesign um what the different parts of the ethereum chain so like for example um the words will also make ethereum much more friendly to white clients right so today if you want to access the ethereum chain like a lot of most people generally use like some wallet like metamask and the way those wallets work is they talk to a server and to basically trust whatever answers the server gives them and so with uh light clients um after the merge like once that tech is developed you will be able to like basically have a client that actually verifies the data that it gets back so basically the merge isn't just about the merge the merge is also about other things down the line that the merge is going to enable so that's the merge prototank sharding so ",
        "9": "opens up more data space transactions will become cheaper and compression means the transactions get even cheaper again right cheap cheap cheap yay so yeah i don't know yeah no i mean i know there's you know inflation and like eight and a half percent and like gas prices are going up but like here gas prices are going down [Applause] so what can we do with a safer blockchain and cheaper transactions right i think this is uh probably the big question um so probably one of the big and really important things is just lower transaction fees are the thing and the only thing that can make blockchains affordable for anyone right so um median income per day in canada at least according to the the data at this link here is about 113 um dollars so this is all in us dollars just to kind ",
        "10": "of put put all the different countries in the same unit in poland a median income per day is 42 in mongolia goes down to 16 and in zambia goes down to four dollars right so very big differences and we can compare against these numbers average transaction fees on ethereum for the last couple of years now obviously they've gone up and down a lot but generally they've it's been somewhere in between one and twenty dollars right now today if your transaction fees are fortunately a bit lower but um you know that's because we're in a bit of a bear market at least relative to you know 2021 uh so that's obviously not something that we can count on right like it's uh like basically if um you know if we see one of these uh ball cycles uh pop up again anytime soon then like you know even the cheap transaction fees that we see today you know it's not gonna happen or no fees are gonna go crazy again right uh so that's on the ethereum base layer right ",
        "11": "and if you if you take let's say in the middle of that range like or take about five dollars then you can see how you know to a lot of canadians it might you know it can be affordable to send blockchain transactions for a lot of applications but if we're talking about like blockchains being this global thing that's supposed to you know empower people who are not empowered today um in um underprivileged countries then you can see how it starts looking less viable right because we're talking about single transactions potentially taking up people's entire daily income and one of the things that you actually see um if you visit some of these voices as we have right is that a lot of the time people do love watching they do love uh cryptocurrency i should say they love cryptocurrency but they don't love blockchains that's probably the way to put it right because uh what what you actually see often enough is that people have cryptocurrency but they have it in finance wallets right like you even see you know entire ecosystems where that just it's just accepted that everyone has a ",
        "12": "finance wallet and that and like sending from by finance wallet to a minus wallet is the way that you make transactions right so why does this happen well obviously right if the blockchain is too expensive people are going to look for something else um that's like just a fact and it's the fact that we have to deal with and so if we want to actually wants to have a world where like we can have watching activity happening without needing to trust centralized exchanges for everything then we just have to learn how to make blockchains cheaper now today with rollups um it's already sometimes 25 cents sometimes less than 25 cents and if you just like analyze what's going to happen as a result of the improvements to roll-ups that i mentioned in the future then we're talking about potential fees of maybe five cents or maybe even as low as 0.2 cents so massively cheaper uh transactions to the point where the unchanged transactions actually will become affordable for lots of people for ",
        "13": "whom they are not affordable today um bringing back crypto payments so this is uh an interesting idea right basically yeah for those who and who here has been in the crypto space since at least uh 2013. um who here has read the bitcoin white paper but here remember is the title of the bitcoin white paper um bitcoin a peer-to-peer electronic cash system right like you know back in the good old days people thought blockchains were for paying people so yeah right so so you know even but back in this this picture um i'm curious does anyone recognize which city and uh this is from it's not toronto um it is uh i believe i believe this is actually berlin this is uh the bitcoin teats um basically it's uh the uh this is um there was an effort in 2013. um where ",
        "14": "people tried really hard to like get a lot of people to move to one place and to get a lot of restaurants like in the same region to all accept bitcoin at the same time and there was like this big social movement where people are really excited about like just trying to get an in-person bitcoin economy happening right and it started and it continued for some time but fast forward a few years later and people have mostly kind of stopped about talking about these things right and i think one of the reasons why is basically because blockchains for in-person payments so it just started stopped looking as attractive as they did before right and fees are just an obvious reason why right back in 2013 the uh one of the main arguments for why you should accept bitcoin was fees right the argument basically was like look paypal and the credit companies are very mean to us they charge at 29 cents plus 2.9 for transactions and they charge even more if it's international and so ",
        "15": "if you use a if you send a payment with bitcoin well the transaction fees are one cent right and this was the arguments and this was like the pitch by which uh the first wave of merchant adoption happened now since then that that argument has basically just become completely false now if blockchains can scale then guess what the argument becomes true again and so we're in a future where blockchains are cheap and we have even more network effects than we did before so the question is if we have much more scalable blockchains can we actually bring uh bring back crypto payments and i think it's something that's going to be worth trying right now crypto payments are something that exists in a lot of different ways right so there's crypto payments on the internet right you know lots of people use cryptocurrency for international payments already like it's just something that happens quietly and like people who do it you know they they just quiet quietly do it but there's no ",
        "16": "reason for them to make a big marketing pitch and and announce it and and so it is happening but you know there are a lot of cases where more of it could be happening and it just isn't happening yet uh so there's people there but there's also kind of consumers and worship payments like paying for goods with businesses there is also um in-person payments right so in-person payments we tried to do and i think it may be worth trying to do again uh there are obviously micro payments there's many different kinds of payments right but this is uh the sort of thing that like today is a fairly niche thing but i think especially with blockchains being much more affordable it is something that could grow much more in the future um non-financial applications right so one of the big things about ethereum is like ethereum is not just a payment system right and there's supposed to be this like big um array of all of these other amazing things that you could use blockchains to do uh so um ens is probably the big one ",
        "17": "so a court here has used a non-financial application on ethereum that's not ems who here has used dns right so ens is like by far the most popular uh non-financial application on the ethereum blockchain right and i think the reason why it's pretty clear it's just a really valuable and useful tool um and i think uh the interesting thing about enas is that it's like one piece of a puzzle that where there are a couple of other pieces that are very complementary to it that can help to like actually create basically like some kind of decentralized identity ecosystem on top of ethereum right so you have ens and ens gives you once you have a username without that username being tied to a company that controls it um account management right so let's say who here remembers pgp 1990s crypto wars everyone has their own you know public tea web of trust right ",
        "18": "there was this really big idealistic effort to try to kind of create this ecosystem where everyone would have their own cryptographic teeth um and with these uh you know people would be able to sign messages and be able to encrypt messages we'd have privacy we would have security and like all without having to rely on intermediaries but the network effects never really had never really happened and it just sort of never really panned out well right now fast forward to today we have millions of people with uh crypto wallets and we have millions of people that have private keys inside their own browsers now why right well because they want to trade monkey pictures right so it's like you know 1990s you know you have these really kind of deep and philosophical arguments about like oh you know there's a fun you know there's this fundamental great battle between the authority of the nation state and the desire for individual freedom and if you want to protect privacy and if you want to assert your independence then you should then cryptography is the future of ",
        "19": "ensuring freedom of the humanity fast forward 20 years and it's like hey look it's a monkey guess which one works better so now as a but like so this is like in my one of the kind of interesting doubles double-edged swords of the crypto space right it's like the problem with the pre-crypto sort of idealistic decentralized tech movement is that it never had enough incentives the problem with the crypto space is that like it has great incentives but at the same time it has incentives to like go in very weird directions sometimes right so at the same time though like we have actually created this ecosystem where lots of people have cryptographic keys and we actually get the possibility of using these cryptographic keys for other applications and not just stuff on the blockchain so there's this project called sign in with ethereum where you can use your ethereal wallet as a way to sign into web services so if you go to chat.walkscan.com ",
        "20": "you know you actually see there's like a chat application it's basically like a telegram clone except you don't have to give a give your phone number to use it you just like use your phone use your if you sign in with your ethereum account and you know like anyone who has an ethereum address basically already has a chat blogscan.com account um and you know if you know someone's else name you can go send them a message i mean you can send me a message i probably won't read it but you know you can send me a message um now so and i think sign in with ethereum is like one of those things that kind of expects to start slowly growing more and more over time right um now one of the problems though is that if you just use cryptographic keys as your wallet as your account then like what happens if your key gets stolen what happens if you lose your key what happens if like any kind of accident happens now one of the kind of pitches that sometimes uh you know traditional left two companies argue about like you know why google should control your account ",
        "21": "and why it's good is because they can do account recovery right it's like if you lose your account or if something bad happens there's like people and you can appeal to those people and those people can give you your accounts back now like my personal experience with this argument is that it's like somehow actually not true right like i've actually like i've personally talked to people who've had like trouble with their accounts with a lot of these webservices and they just like often they just can't get like get their problem fixed like they reach out to support reach out to support and they just like get stuck i mean like i personally a few months ago like i had my uh amazon account some you know flags you know like self-suspicious activity thing because i dare travel between different countries um and then you know there's a form and like filled in the form and at some point they said okay well we filled in the form but we don't have enough information and like you know please hold on and like basically i i have not gotten my amazon account back right so what two companies are like you know they talk about how you know centralization is good because uh like ",
        "22": "you at least provides recovery but like somehow they've screwed this up so much that often they don't actually provide recovery so what can we do so what three can do this better right so for the last couple of years i've been talking about this concept of social recovery where like you can choose you know who your recovery contacts are right and like you can make whatever choices you want so you can say i'm going to have five recovery contacts two of them are going to be an institution one of them can be my employer one of them could be my dad one of them can be a friend and any three of those five can come together and recover your accounts and kind of reset your key to something else right and this is something that you can put into the rules on a smart contract put that on chain um so the this is um you know it's a very simple approach um and it's uh i think a sort of a model of security that is like both very decentralized right like you're not giving up your control to any one single ",
        "23": "person um and it relies on forms of trust that people have and that people are good at right like i think people and especially less technical normal people are going to be better at picking seven to seven friends that they trust and they are going to be like writing down 24 words and making sure they write down write it down correctly making sure this weird piece of paper is like they're going to be able to keep it for 10 years and not lose it or get it stolen ever but you know so it's like actually a great solution but implementing it correctly requires smart contract wallets so fortunately smart contract wallets are actually coming now interestingly enough smart contract wallets themselves so like actually being able to track like when these account recoveries happen when these key changes happen this itself requires a blockchain right so it's like instead of using your accounts to log into or using your kind of off chain accounts to interact with stuff on the blockchain it's like no you're using your account which is on the blockchain to sign into services that can ",
        "24": "themselves also be centralized services that live on off-chain right so you can use the same account to sign into unchained stuff and off-chain stuff so that's um the second piece of the puzzle third piece of the puzzle attestations right so uh you know it would be nice for example if you can prove that that your account actually is a human and that it's not a bot right so this is something that like for example in the context of social media a lot of people care about right so you know if you want to improve the quality of social media and like reduce the level of terrible stuff um without kind of you know trying to impose political like specific political opinions or like controlled in particular directions or whatever one very simple thing that you could do is just make sure that you know the people who are posting actually are people instead of being like some fake like uh kind of farm where you have one person controlling five thousand accounts of the robot right but if you want to do this then like you have to be able to ",
        "25": "actually tell you know who the real humans are and who the bots are now fortunately on chain attestations um can actually help right so like if you use your ethereum account to sign into a service the service can actually go and inspect like first of all has this account ever sent a transaction right sending a transaction requires paying a transaction fee so just whether or not you send a transaction is like the simplest possible filter that makes it hard to create ten thousand fake accounts um just by making it really expensive step two um you can look at like things that that account has done you can check for a proof of humanity profile you can check for like a pope uh you know it's a token that proves that you attended some particular event right there's like a lot of different things that you can check for and once you do that then you like you can get some kind of like better indication of like well how likely is it that this account actually is a unique person now this is something that we can improve over time so we can combine it with you know fancy uranus stuff and we can improve privacy and you ",
        "26": "can do really fancy and cool stuff like prove you're a human without revealing which human you are right so we can have kind of privacy and uh better security at the same time now these are all different kind of pieces that really fit into each other right so you want to have an account in order to sign into services and interact with services now with that you want your accounts to have a name if you want to have a name ens is great for that if you have an account you want to be able to like manage that account be able to change the key do security stuff on chain smart contract wallets and you want to prove things about yourself um unchained at the stations or off-chain attestations could i kind of with proofs attached could work as well right so all of these pieces really fit together into this kind of ethereum identity ecosystem and like to me this is probably like the best candidate for sort of ethereum's second major app um aside from the the defy ecosystem so that's not financial applications um dao's i think are also ",
        "27": "interesting right and dao's i think we've seen a lot of like big dallas but we can but we can also see a lot like we could see more micro scale dows just like five or ten friends coming together for some amount of time and pooling a few thousand dollars together for some community activities so things that are kind of a little bit too simple to create an entire corporation around but where he still wants to you know have the money be on chain and like have some to kind of make decisions together and have some transparency so all of these things could be done on chain right but making it viable and making people wants to do these things on-chain requires the chain to be much more affordable um there's enterprise blockchain use cases as well right so people have been talking about enterprise watching use cases for years um and i think in this case like we don't actually need like fancy um you know um roll ups and prototank charting for this there's a a structure called a volitium that people that have been looking into and that building more and more basically it's like ",
        "28": "you do things in a server and you do you kind of do execute things in a centralized way but then you use cryptographic proofs like cksnarks and you publish them on chain and that way you have a regular record that basically proves that the changes that are happening are changes that actually are following the rules and because you're publishing on chain you can prove that you're not like giving different evidence to different people and you can prove that the system isn't like reverting anything and then stop moving backwards right so these are this is also technology that is rapidly improving it's rapidly improved a lot over the last two years and especially i think with some of the zika vm stuff that's happening it's going to improve even further um so these are like some of the consequences that are going to happen from the technical improvements that are happening in ethereum over the next couple of years right but there are other technical improvements so the ethereum chain might in the future become not just cheaper but also faster instead of including your transaction ",
        "29": "after half a minute we might be able to provide confirmations after some shorter period of time what kinds of things will that make easier um what about improvements to privacy right well like what what can we do more of if ethereum becomes a more privacy preserving system what will better middleware unlock right so if people build applications are there applications that other applications can talk to where if you make one application good that itself opens space for even more applications i mean i don't know but i think these are all questions worth thinking about right so yeah this is uh this is basically what what i want what i hope that we can start thinking about more right the technical improvements are happening and they're going to happen but like what kinds of improvements in terms of what we use ethereum for are these things going to make possible thank you "
