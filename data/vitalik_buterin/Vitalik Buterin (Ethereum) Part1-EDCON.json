        "0": "great okay thank you all for coming so I just to like get right into it my god what I wanted to do today is kind of go back to the basics a bit and basically give a more kind of fun a description of not so much the product of etherium research but more the process that we've been taking over the last at a couple of years in order to try and figure out you know what kind of protocol should we actually be building so you know if we want to design a piece of steak algorithm or if we want to design an algorithm for sharding or even something higher level like if you're building some some kind of decentralized Oracle you know what methodology would you use in order to figure out whether or not it's safe right so in general the way that I sing I mean both myself and many other people in the crm research community thing to Bella to the scent of ",
        "1": "general notion of crypto economics is that it's about using a collection of cryptographic and economic building blocks in order to build systems that have certain desirable information security properties right so basically you can use cryptography in order to prove properties about messages that happens in the past and you can use economics you can use economic incentives defined inside of a system in order to encourage certain desired properties of that system to hold into the future right so cryptography is kind of backward working and economics and forward-looking so just to go through a quick example if we look at you know something like Bitcoin basically it has a few desired properties right and what an you can you can think of these as our property is at many different levels right so for example at a higher level you can think of it as being it's super ",
        "2": "existing to provide peer to peer digital currency but at a lower level you can think of the system as existing to create a chain of watch tuned in to include transactions that users send into those boss to maintain a list notion of state into Bitcoin the state is called aut exocet but you can think of the state is just representing how much money everyone has and two transactions affect the state so there's a function that takes an old state applies the transaction to it and give you a new state so for example if the old state says that I have 500 bitcoins and Vlad has 100 bitcoins a transaction is that I send 510 bitcoins the new state is that I have 490 bitcoins and flash has 110 bitcoins that makes sense to everyone great ok so and also another kind of us much smaller function of Bitcoin but one that does still technically exist in its in there is to maintain its walks and so blocks contain timestamps and these timestamps are in ",
        "3": "theory supposed I'll we start with in some valid reflects reality so from a kind of very low level standpoint these are properties that we want the Bitcoin blockchain the house right so you can say you can also think of those are the properties in this way so you can think about convergence so convergence basically a perfect ideal convergence says that you have new blocks that get created new blocks get added on to the existing chain but what do not get replaced and blogs do not get removed validity so only transactions that specify certain predicate valid so it'd be a predicate that takes as input the state and the transaction with respects to the state at the time of execution should be included in little boy so what does this mean so basically let's say that I now have 490 bitcoins and I decide that I am going to spend 400 bitcoins to me hice then that transaction with respect to the current state should be valid now let's say the ",
        "4": "transaction gets executed now after the transaction gets executed d costly send me high 400 bitcoins I have 90 big ones left with respect to the new state me sending 400 bitcoins is no longer valid because they don't have enough money anymore so a similar transaction should not be allowed to be included a second time right so that's one example of a wooden validity means and with respect to the clock the clock should be roughly in increasing is from one kind of visitor Adam and the clock should also reflect reality no vena saleability so this is another fairly important one and this is one that we kind of think about a bit less but it's one that's really important basically it should be possible to download the full data associated with a block it so you could imagine you know if a mining cartel really wants to it could start mining a chain of walks where all of the blocks are completely valid but the cartel only publishes the headers to the blocks it doesn't publish anything else in the ",
        "5": "blocks and all the rest of the data it just keeps to itself you know this actually would be a failure of the system because no one else would actually know what the state is and that's bad but in this is one kind of failure mode that you do want to take you to take into account right so in the case of Bitcoin basically it solves this customer whether they're kind of lead in one way of stuff through the full node protocol so at the full node you only accept blocks that you can personally download everything and verify a new everything or with the like node protocol it kind of implicitly trust a minor majority as the ability so basically the states that if you said the transaction then the transaction should be able to get quickly included if it pays sufficiently high speed now as people who have followed the Bitcoin block chain from the last couple of weeks no sufficiently high fee hmm but you know basically the point is that if I have a bunch of you know if I have a transaction and it really really wants to get in quick getting get it included the system should not kind of ",
        "6": "discriminate against me the system should not just like not allow anything to get in so what there are a bunch of behaviors that would be really really bad now this actually gets very important if we start with going into kind of see if people start heavily using things like second way or architectures because if you think about something like a channel based system you know something like the lightning networks payment channels right in then any evaluation of availability in this sense so a censorship attacks can be fairly it translated into a SEF attack on the channel system right so basically if either especially if you know the Bitcoin community starts going in that direction which was important um so you know this is what a block chain works like you have science the MC of nan says in the real world the prep hashes have a 32 byte speed and they don't have six bytes and transactions so cryptography right so there is some in bic when you have basically three forms of cryptography so ",
        "7": "you have proof of work which is a very kind of P you can think of it as any kind of mathematical puzzle solution that that probabilistically proves that you have access to some amount of computing power signatures proving the authenticity of the transaction sender and hashes and hashes in de qin serve two purposes one of them is to ensure the kind of consistent to an ordering of the chain so in all you can't kind of swap blocks in and out of the middle of the chain without making the chain kind of not self consistent anymore and they also serve this function and the like in the the Merkel tree that points to all the transactions where basically they create this data structure that is kind of efficiently auditable in a certain sense and we are you can efficiently prove inclusion of certain transactions imagery so incentives in Bitcoin basically you have no the incentives are ",
        "8": "fairly simple the minor of a block gets a reward of 12.5 BTC right now if they get include if they get up watching for it in a trance if it's a block including the chain and the minor also has the ability to kind of extract an economic rent because the minor is in some sense and temporary dictator over the rights to include transactions in machine for during the scope of that one particular block that they are creating mundum my nerve of watch that doesn't get into machine gets nothing and there is a because of difficulty adjustment rules it's also important to note that there is this property that rewards in the Bitcoin blockchain are marginally a long run 0 sub right so if you can make other people how it get less money than you that then that translates into a kind of 14 one ability for you to get more money and this is in some ways the source of as a selfish mining attack so cryptography so if what says think about ",
        "9": "the kind of cryptographic toolbox that we have more broadly right so the first thing that we have is hashes so the purpose of hashes is to prove the topological order of messages now what do I mean by this basically topological order you can think of it as a kind of partial ordering so if a includes the hash of B then a came after be right now a topological order is partial because you could have two objects where neither of them is kind of contains the hash of the of the other and so you can't really tell what kind of which one came first but in other cases you do have an order right so if it contains the hash of B that means that a can came after be if he contains the hash of B and D continues to hash of C then a is after B&B is after C and so by transitivity is after see so does end because base because of what what one of the kind of properties of hash algorithms is that you can't create kind of cyclic luck cyclic graphs of vino things pointing to ",
        "10": "other things that point other things that point back to the first thing and so you know what's a cyclic and you have an order now signatures signatures also I should point out that hashes aside from topological ordering they also have this important function that they allow a small piece of data to kind of stand in for a much larger piece of data and if you verify something about a small piece of data then that allows you to and verified clean about a larger piece of data as well signatures are about verifying the authenticity of the sender and your knowledge proofs basically proved arbitrary computable predicates on messages so basically what this means is that if you have you have some private piece of data or some public piece of data and you want to prove something about it so you want to prove without some computation on that data leads to some output then you can do that the proof can be efficient we verified and people can be convinced that even if your original data is private that you actually do know a number that if you send it through this ",
        "11": "computational process have some output so that's another tool in the toolbox oh we also have more exotic stuff right so for example proof of work which is a kind of probabilistic proof that you have access to a certain amount of expected computational power erasure codes so raise your codes basically their original usages in redundant backups where you know if you have a one gigabyte file then you can turn it into chunks where the chunks out outfits you gigabytes but any one gigabyte out of those two gigabytes can be combined combines together and you can in recover the original file but over in the context of block chains you can think of it as a way to turn a 100-percent data availability requirement into a 50-percent data availability requirement we're so if you publish a block then in for the block to be available you would have to be able to download the whole thing but if you publish a razor coated blocks then as long as the erasure coding is done correctly 50 anything of a fifty percent or more of that data ",
        "12": "basically satisfies as a stand-in for the original block sign wach crypto so or some what I sometimes call sack Wachtel peripherals work basically you can prove that some amount bit some amount of time passed between message and message be right so the first of all proves that B is topologically after a but it also proves this extra thing about timing amorphous encryption and obfuscation so basically you can convert functions into functions that have that are isomorphic but that's kind of have more privacy preserving properties so those those are some basically kind of the crypto tools that we have to work with right and if you're going to build systems that rely on these tools you don't even necessarily needs to deeply no and no one understand how they work but it is kind of good to understand abstractly what what property is those functions have in kind of what they're for so economics what do we have so there's actually two kinds of incentives ",
        "13": "that we crypto economic skin a sign right so one kind of incentive is a token so token basically you can incentivize actors by assigning them units of a protocol defines cryptocurrency so a protocol where that protocol itself defines the corrupt occur and the protocol itself has control over that cryptocurrencies balances it can use that cryptic rasiya provided that that cryptic currency has value to incentivize things now you can have rewards you can make balances go up you can have penalties you can have balances go down but like in general people would rather have more tokens than less tokens and you can use this to kind of drive people to work certain behaviors a second kind of incentive and one that we probably talked about less its privileges so one basically privileges of means that you can incentivize actors by giving those actors decision-making rights when those decision-making rights can be used to extract rent so what do ",
        "14": "we mean by this one very simple example if you create a block then you have a certain amount of space you have the ability to include transactions and because you have decision-making power over whether or not to include transactions other people can bribe you to basically do what they want you to do with that space which is to include their transactions and this is a source of revenue for you and this is even though you know I use words like bribing and economic rents to describe it in this case this is actually a kind of desired behavior because and it serves a dual purpose of kind of incentivizing people to purchase to participate in the protocol and also creating a kind of efficient market for transaction and coercion so once again incentives can be either rewards or penalties so rewards you know if you do something good then you can increase actors token token balances and if people do something bad then you can delete their tokens or you can actually insert this should say ",
        "15": "instead of giving them privileges it should say deny their future privileges right so one example of denying future privileges is if an actor does something bad then you can kick them out of the validator pool so they can't create blocks anymore so some important concepts in crypto economics so one of them is crypto economic security margin so a crypto Economic Security Morrison basically means that it's an amount of money X where you can prove about some system that even a gearing is either guarantee EG adult that system is satisfied or though is at fault for violating back guarantee or poorer than they otherwise would have been by a margin which is equal to always 2 x's so basically either the system works or the system breaks but some people pay for it crypto economic proof so a crypto economic proof basically means a message signed by an actor where because of the cribby kind of ways that the protocol ",
        "16": "works you can interpret the message as kind of saying I uncertified either some claim is true or that I suffering because I created this proof I suffer an economic loss of at least size x so you can only one very practical example of what you would you it's a crypto economic proof for is in a like line protocol right so if you can imagine that you that someone has the ability to create a transaction where they lose let's say up 10,000 ether unless the blah some wat cash is equal to some value and if you can prove that that property actually holds even without even having a whole bunch of recent information then look this is one way that you can make a like line protocol because if someone sends you one of these proofs then you know either that claim is true or that claim is false but they pay it a million-dollar to trick you and generally people are marching to be willing to pay a million dollars to trick you now next thing we can talk ",
        "17": "about is we can talk about unquote various different security models so there's generally three kinds of security models that we think about "
