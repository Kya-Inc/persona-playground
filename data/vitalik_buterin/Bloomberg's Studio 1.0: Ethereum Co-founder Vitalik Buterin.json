        "0": "[Music] he was born in russia emigrated to canada with his parents at the age of six and had already mastered multiple languages mathematics and engineering by the time he got to high school at age 17 his father introduced him to bitcoin he couldn't afford to buy it so he wrote about it instead and while he found bitcoin fascinating he felt like he had an even better idea in 2013 vitalik buterin wrote the original white paper that conceived ethereum not just a digital currency but an entire network built on the blockchain it's now worth more than 300 billion dollars and the biggest believers claim it will send the rest of the cryptocurrency market into the ether joining me on this edition of bloomberg studio 1.0 the inventor of ethereum vitalik buterin we're going to talk about ethereum but i want to start first with how you got ",
        "1": "here you were born in russia you emigrated to canada with your parents when you were just six years old and you started learning about bitcoin from your father what is it about bitcoin that hooked you both bitcoin is uh really interesting because of how interdisciplinary it is i was very interested in math and computer programming and cryptography and technology i am was also very interested in like economics and kind of politics and philosophy and uh bitcoin just happens to be this like interesting fusion of all of these things right and at the same time like it's not just a piece of code that that's uh there for fun it's not even just an app like it's uh something that's really intended to have a very big and meaningful impact on how the world works um and so i think uh but just having both of those aspects together definitely made bitcoin very interesting to both me and my dad as i ",
        "2": "understand it you didn't have enough money to mine so you wrote about it instead and in 2013 you wrote the original white paper that became the basis for ethereum what was it that sparked that original vision so i joined the bitcoin space in early 2011 and i wrote that ethereum white paper at the end of 2013 that was the time when things first blew up and and uh it was clear that you know this was something that's significant right like i remember going to the bitcoin conference in san jose which had about a thousand people in it and that was when i realized that like hey this isn't just a bunch of weirdos who and we exist on the internet like this is real there's people trying to actually do things there's people building businesses um a lot of which are actually pretty successful what started happening then was people started thinking well we have bitcoin what next right so what else can you do with uh blockchains like what would ",
        "3": "bitcoin 2.0 or cryptocurrency 2.0 um look like as i understand it it's it wants to be a whole new operating system like a new apple ios which with a ton of apps built on top of the blockchain in the simplest terms what is ethereum and how is it different from bitcoin so bitcoin is a blockchain that's designed for one application right which is like maintaining and letting people use bitcoin the currency ethereum is a general purpose blockchain so instead of being a blockchain that's designed for one application ethereum is a blockchain that supports a built-in programming language and it whatever blockchain application you want to build you can just write the logic of that application in the programming language upload that program to the chain and this becomes what we call a smart contract and anyone can then interact with your application and the blockchain interprets the rules of your application ",
        "4": "for you um so instead of being something that's designed to do one thing it's designed to open up space for creativity to like basically let people do whatever thing that they want to do on top of it so is the idea then that the next facebook or twitter would not be owned by jack dorsey or mark zuckerberg but be built on the blockchain and owned by everyone there are multiple projects already trying to do that and uh lots of them are based on ethereum so yes so then is ethereum a threat to establish centralized companies and social networks like facebook like twitter like google i think it can be a threat but it can also be an opportunity like i think even uh jack dorsey himself right he has this a project called blue sky which is trying to figure out how twitter can kind of incorporate decentralized uh elements and you know i think a lot of ",
        "5": "these projects wants to actually do this right because i think a lot of them are realizing that being a kind of centralized focus of power and having control and of uh so much of everyone's data and all of these things like it's it's not just an asset it can also be a liability as well now we still don't know who satoshi nakamoto is whether that's even a single person or a group of people what is it like to be a known and visible figure behind such a popular technology i mean there's definitely times when i want to be less visible um but i guess that comes with the with the territory why do you want to be less visible i mean one of the other ethereum co-founders anthony delorio recently announced he's quitting crypto because of safety concerns i mean is that part of your concern as well ",
        "6": "i mean it's not so much physical safety per se as just like wanting the ability to also you know have a life and not just have like random people um running up and uh saying are you the vitalik buderin um i don't know i yeah there's definitely times when i find such things annoying and so i don't know i'm like i'm likely to keep wearing my mask in lots of places and that has nothing to do with covid there was a lot of debate early on about what ethereum could be would be should be for-profit non-profit non-profit one out and i know that that was really important to you why did you want ethereum to be a non-profit and how did you come to that decision it was just very important to me that like this is a technology that decentralized infrastructure that's meant to be not controlled and not owned by anyone and it's a platform that's for the world and and so for that platform ",
        "7": "to be connected to a company that had a very small number of shareholders i think is uh something that could really centralize the ecosystem and so something that i thought would be very was very unhealthy and wanted to really avoid now nfts in particular have really helped bring new users into the crypto tent we saw you at ashton kutcher and mila kunis's kitchen table ethereum you also were not happy about kim kardashian getting involved and i'm curious where do you draw the line when it comes to celebrity endorsement the thing that i was unhappy with about kim kardashian was that she basically like shield something like um ethereum max that was made like i you know i'd call it a borderline scam right it seems like this uh project so that's basically just like at best a a pure money grab that's not really providing much of value ",
        "8": "ethereum has had some growing pains why do these problems exist this entire ecosystem has blown up and gotten big fairly quickly ethereum has had some growing pains whether it is high transaction costs traffic jams front running why do these problems exist this is uh the scalability problem everyone's been talking about the scalability problem for at least five years now and and in uh basically it's like a simple supply and demand problem right like if the number of people who want to send transactions goes up but the amount of space for transactions on chain doesn't go up then all of these people could want to send transactions or bidding against each other and only the ones that are willing to pay a really high amount can actually get in the only way to solve this is to just improve the technology to increase the number of transactions that the system ",
        "9": "can process and it's why we're doing we've been doing just all kinds of incremental improvements to the blockchain clients and the protocol and the code over the last five years ethereum scalability has increased by about a factor of five um since uh the project started and then there are some problems that are not like just just scaling problems per se but they're still technology problems right like there are problems that have to do with the facts that this entire ecosystem has blown up and gotten big fairly quickly there's a lot of aspects of it where people are still trying to understand like what is the correct way and what is the safest way to do these things right like for example the state of uh just security auditing for blockchain protocols like it has gotten much better since uh the dow hack back in 2016 right but you know at the same time challenges continue to exist and that's normal in any space when uh you know you have uh i guess a usage growing faster and then the ",
        "10": "technology catches up can you contrast proof-of-stake with proof-of-work why do you think that's so much better the reason why blockchains need to have proof of something right is because like these are decentralized systems so for example in proof-of-work like the system actually measures how much computing power is being put into each block and so in order for an attacker to take over the network they actually have to have more computing power than the rest of the network combined right like so you can't just spin up a billion virtual machines on one computer but the problem is that it requires a huge number of computers to be constantly running 24 7. so it works but it's very expensive proof-of-stake it works differently right so proof-of-stake works by instead using coins as the economic resource so if you have coins inside of the system then you just sign messages with those coins and for an attacker to take over they have to basically have like more ",
        "11": "coins than the rest of the network put together so it does the same thing but it avoids the need to have these computers running 24 7 and that's where the efficiency comes from you're planning major upgrades meantime and ease 2.0 is well underway what will that accomplish what problems will it solve so i think what people call east 2.0 as uh has two big parts right one big part is the switch to proof of stake so after a full transition to proof of stake um there will not be more any more mining um ethereum's energy consumption will go down from by like a factor of more than one thousand so it'll go from being a big problem to basically not a problem at all um and the chain will become more secure more secure it'll become more efficient um so after that the next major milestone is what's called the merge which is uh when basically the proof of work chain just stops running and all of the applications on the proof of work chain ",
        "12": "get moved over to the produce station and continue running inside of the proof state chain from there now while you're working on all of this ethereum has developed uh an unseemly reputation as a fertile ground for scams and i wonder how concerned you are about a crackdown like we saw with icos what are the longer term consequences there's definitely going to be crackdowns on things happening on blockchains just like there's crackdowns on things happening on the internet i do think um that the state of the industry and the state of things is improving but if you just compare it to the way that the space was fought like five or eight years ago right like 2014 remember um mount gox just like collapsed and uh half a billion dollars disappeared like basic and i think we still don't know where most of it is and like things do continue to happen from time to time but just like as a fraction of the scale of the space i do think that it keeps getting smaller and smaller one big consequence ",
        "13": "of course is that mining is moving out of china which i mean there's a there's definitely a silver lining there in terms of decentralization in that you don't have as much hash power located in one country anymore um but at the same time you know the the mining farms there were you know real companies with real employees and real people some degree of regulatory action is happening but it's not looking like you know anything close to um you know the level of like say what people feared 10 years ago there's concerns about russia being behind a spate of cyber attacks and cryptocurrency being used as a tool of extortion how do you think about the intersection of crypto and cyber warfare to me i think that this is a yeah a temporary phase like i think what's um happened is that just like even like the internet as a whole it grew a ",
        "14": "huge amount over the last 20 years and for most of that 20 years people just did not take security seriously it's even the wrong thing to be doing to be trying to blame attackers ultimately the thing is that's at fault is the fact that there are these excellent tools within cryptography and like within you know the technology behind cryptocurrency itself that allow you to um be much more secure against these kinds of things and i mean my personal hope is that people like at least see like the level of attacks that are happening now as a wake-up call and that we get a massive effort to just improve the level of security and just know across every industry and across the world because if the if that doesn't happen right like then you know it's not it it's not even ransomware attackers or that are going to be a problem like it's at some point you know whenever the first like full-scale cyber war happens if people ",
        "15": "are not prepared it's something that could end up you know being real being something really bad for the world whether bitcoin ethereum or the blockchain really are changing the world seems to be an ongoing debate is crypto the future or is it a fad i think it's the future that contains fads right now it is mostly finance apps that are built on ethereum aside from nfts and i'm wondering what is the killer app for ethereum that could lead to widespread adoption much like email was for the internet i think there's a few candidates um so d5 is obviously one of them um i think the like blockchain-based financial things have always been attractive because like the traditional financial system just sucks more than traditional centralized tech right like if i send an email to ",
        "16": "um you know someone in guatemala then they're going to receive it in one second with finance you can't even say that a lot of people in companies even today just to use cryptocurrency to send money internationally outside of finance i yeah i think one interesting area that i where i think blockchains might go if you notice some that in order to access your assets in ethereum you needs to have an account we're getting to the point where there's a lot of work that's been done on making these accounts very secure and so instead of just being accounts that hold money like these these turn into like full fully blown profiles right and and once you have profiles then you can start doing decentralized social media on top of that the social and financial things that you that you can do with that like even working together um is something that i think could be really big now whether bitcoin ethereum or the blockchain really are changing the world ",
        "17": "seems to be an ongoing debate is crypto the future or is it a fad i think it's the future that contains fads much like the internet was the future and the internet contained fads um you know there's definitely specific kinds of applications that do get overhyped from time to time like um icos back in 2017 and then you know certain kinds of d5 right now um but at the same time there's other d5 projects that really are uh valuable there's a combination of both right and figuring out which is which is it maybe it's something that's difficult to see ahead of time and it's something that you know we as an ecosystem are going to find out so the crypto skeptics many people um that uh you know are admired in the financial world jamie dimon warren buffett are they just wrong a lot of them have definitely been just wrong already right like they expected even back in 2013 to 15 at least some of them to seek blockchains that cryptocurrency fail and go down to ",
        "18": "zero and price and just not get any more interest completely and even today they've already been far more successful than any of them expected so i can see how people in uh traditional finance or at least some of them can be inclined to kind of not see the value of blockchain based finance immediately there's a lot of people even in traditional banks that see the value that blockchains provide and have been trying to come up with things and work with them one of them is jack dorsey jack dorsey recently announced square is creating a new business focused on decentralized financial services based on bitcoin using bitcoin what have you learned about jack dorsey's plans does it seem like he's building something that sounds a lot like ethereum i'm skeptical about these uh a decentralized finance on top of that bitcoin type of project so ",
        "19": "basically because like the difference between bitcoin and ethereum right this is uh is um that on ethereum there's like native functionality that allows you to essentially directly put either eth or ethereum based assets into these smart contracts into these lock boxes when where there's then like arbitrary conditions of any kind that can then govern how those assets get released bitcoin does not have that functionality to the same extent like jack is basically going to have to essentially create his own system that enforces those rules and then on the bitcoin lawyer the bitcoins will just have to be owned by probably a multi-sig wallet controlled by like either jack or just or the participants in the system it looks similar but it'll end up being something with a much weaker trust model right like i i really think that like this is the whole reason why ethereum started as an independent system in the first place right like there's there's technical limits to your ability to kind of graft new functionality onto ",
        "20": "a system that's not powerful enough to support that new functionality facebook's mark zuckerberg is also making some big moves behind the metaverse and i you know what do you make of them wading into this decentralized world could they replicate some of the same problems that we see in facebook and twitter today i think mark is clearly trying to figure out what the next stage after the internet is and like actually get into it and create it um but you know before the rest of uh i get the world goes in some different direction and facebook is sort of uh you know left in the dust and be and becomes one of these kind of previous generation old world companies um so i mean we we've seen facebook try to get into the crypto space uh with uh libra though and i think in you know in the end like libra did end up ",
        "21": "being possibly the wrong approach um because like the the problem that someone like facebook has right is that a lot of people mistrust them and so building their own platform like i know i know they tried really hard to create something that's a consortium with all these different um industry participants but at the same like even that was not enough right and there's just a huge amount of mistrust of them but with the metaverse i guess the thing that happened during the pandemic is that we've basically very quickly switched from a world where the physical world was people's kind of primary cell center of um experience and the internet was this new add-on to a world where the internet really is the center of people's experiences and so we basically are spending most of our time in a virtual world and the question is just like what level of quality does that virtual world have so ethereum in five years and 10 years where is it uh i mean hopefully running ",
        "22": "the metaverse uh but i i guess we'll see how it goes you've got a lot of people out there a lot of people who are trying to understand cryptocurrency who are placing their bets what's your prediction for bitcoin does it replace the dollar does it exist in 50 years or is it something else and then similarly what's your prediction for ethereum because a lot of investors are choosing to hold both or one or the other you'd i think uh replacing the delver completely is unlikely um just that because like there's things that the dollar provides like a price stability for example that bitcoin is not going to provide like i think even in a theoretical world where um the us dollar collapses like even then i think bitcoin is not going to be able to provide the level of like stability that users and businesses expects to be able to set prices in um and in that kind of world look we would need something else like like it could be decentralized stable coins it could be something else but we'll see ",
        "23": "um so but at the same time i think cryptocurrency can still have a very powerful and important role alongside existing currencies ethereum seems to have this reputation of being a community of creative engineering types who like rainbows and cats and mythical creatures i know you have some fun t-shirts yourself is that a fair depiction of the community uh it the community is a diverse place and um you know it has many different kinds of people and you know it definitely has a it's a its fair share of cat people and dog people and unicorn people as well and i think that's awesome and i think uh it's uh i mean it's really healthy to uh yes and not take yourself too seriously and that's definitely something that the in the ethereum community strives to do you know remember that the world is supposed to be a place to have fun too all right vitalic peter and inventor of ethereum ",
