        "0": "[Music] foreign welcome to Nairobi um two questions and I was being a bit of a hog first question is you're notoriously vegan uh what are you eating in Kenya have you enjoyed some uh ugali what's your favorite dish in Kenya so far second question um so this is a bit of a bit more complex in that uh in Africa we see a lot of people from the west from the global North coming down uh and you know looking learning listening uh and oftentimes you know they go back there's some learnings they get a suntan it's great uh what what what what is your plan like what are you doing in Africa what do you what do you what are you most excited about and especially after you leave like what are you going to be doing once you leave first question Joseph do you want to answer better uh vitalik loves uh veggies we had ugalian fish yesterday ",
        "1": "and chicha and other fun stuff yep good answer um yeah I think for long-term plans like uh I think I mean part of our goal is to just try to find ways to support local ity as much as possible right so the ethereum foundation has some programs which try to support people in we know Africa and also other developing regions I know particularly Latin America and Southeast Asia so although the ethereum fellowship program is one example and then the grant program is or the ecosystem support program is like actively looking into expanding into these areas we've started hiring more people with the intentional goal of interacting with you know local businesses and their governments and Community organizations in different ",
        "2": "regions right so um I think like a couple of days of days ago I saw an article that like I think Buenos Aires is like the city is interested in you know starting staking and some you know people are going to get close to the foundation Warfare I'm fairly involved in that so like those kinds of efforts are efforts that were definitely yeah interested in expanding overtime um another thing is events right so uh like I I know our executive director Aya for a long time has said that she would love to have a Defcon in Africa and uh but at the same time like one of the reasons why this hasn't happened yet is uh if you look at like one of the if you look back to our Defcon in Shanghai back in 2016 right this was uh you know big event in China you know partnered with a local organization you know tried really hard but at the same time it was uh less effective than it could have been in ",
        "3": "like really Bridging the Western and Chinese ethereum communities and I think part of that was that basically we kind of walked in and organized in events without really yeah trying hard enough to do kind of Grassroots work to get to the to the point where you know it's really the local community that's putting in most of the effort and not just um you know a whole bunch of people tell reporting from the outside into a hotel and it doesn't really matter where the hotel is um so like that's the kind of mistake that you know we don't want to repeat here um so the goal is to start with uh Community Building encourage and you know support um support influence includes subsidizing includes people coming here includes uh you know advertising and other things some a smaller scale local events I mean some smaller scale events have uh kind of happens here like a little bit right so there was a blockchain conference in Kenya back in 2016 that I went to there ",
        "4": "was an event in like in Cape Town back in 2019 but it was like only yeah a little bit and the goal is to you know get to the point where there's more of those and I get to you know and eventually to the point where it actually yeah makes sense to have a Defcon locally a couple of years in the future right so that's another that's another goal and then also you know supporting local projects uh supporting local developers so one thing that we would love to see for example is like we would love to see if they are being in ethereum client team that's based here right so you know there's already for example uh you know many ethereum client teams development teams that are American European Australian there's a a couple of ZK um evm teams that are Chinese you know um polygon is a part Indian you know we'd love to see a team here right and no probably multiple teams here and uh ",
        "5": "that's going the biggest part of that is going to involve I think a lot of effort from people here but there's things that we can do to try to help and to observe I mean education for example trying to like intention only bring us some more community members together and figuring out how to follow up with more of that kind of work is one of their goals for us just two quick things to add to that um sorry in terms two quick things for that one is um there are so many other uh chains that come to Kenya and Africa and you might you know some of them have like uh African or Kenya off his head or something like that it's quite different with the ethereum ethereum is extremely decentralized in the ethereum foundation only has half a percent of the total token Supply so it's a very small part of the broader ecosystem and community and it's not even driven to say let's ",
        "6": "increase ethereum adoption no matter cause it's not a marketing engine it's more of ecosystem support organization so that's a little bit of a different frame of how to think about ethereum um and that might be sort of how you see ethereum committee members engaging with Kenya in a quite a different way from other players and the second thing I want to mention is geography question like why are we here what sort of coming after here there's a lot of people who want to come and visit so we have a long list of humans who want to come and visit and connect and it's not just visiting the big reason why we're doing this is um a lot of the connections and sense making in the theorem Community happens in the global events that are happening around the world but it's really hard for Africans to go to those events and number one is visas and that's something that you know like is really annoying so what we're trying to do is Bridge more players to come and connect with Builders here to eventually have more events happening here so local and ",
        "7": "Global Builders can connect and and relate to one another so the the goal is we'll have a lot more of these types of activities where there's more bridging happening with global builders thank you good afternoon everyone my name is co-founder of a startup called Fast tiger and what we're actually working on is how to use nfts for the customer intelligence and engagement space my question is particularly around your soul-bound tokens right how you first the fact that you've been in Africa you know that there's a huge identity problem um what are some of the ideas around that and then also just completely randomly it's like actually how we actually got support for our particular project is our Ukrainian friend who was in Nairobi connected us to have you seen zuk and I was walking around trying to look for the ethereum foundation there ",
        "8": "but I wasn't able to so um no that just that small connection of how all these connections of international coming here is really important and so thanks for the organizers for this and so yeah back to this whole Bond tokens and opportunities in Africa yeah I mean I think the whole soul bound tokens concept and you know the identity and reputation ecosystems in general are like a really important topic right and uh like one of the reasons why they were why they're a really important topic is that especially in a global economy where people lots of people are far away from each other and you know don't uh directly know each other or even know each other's countries like some kind of infrastructure for maintain uh trust and reputation is needed and often a lot of the solutions that we just get by default are quite bad right so like one simple example of this is uh if you look just like web logins right so when you ",
        "9": "log into a lot of Internet services today like you often have to log in using you know accentralized usually American services like you know you have login with Gmail login with Twitter log in with Facebook right and the you know these are centralized systems and if you use them to log into things then you get um like like one this company basically sees a whole bunch of information about you they see what you're logging into and what you're using this account for and two you're basically at the mercy of this company in order to just keep your account right so like even like I personally and a lot of my friends have uh often had this situation where our accounts that these are at these Services just randomly got you know blocked suspended password forgotten password stolen one of any number of problems and we tried reaching out to customer support but the customer support did not work right so this is I mean I think this is kind of ironic right because uh within the crypto space ",
        "10": "some of the ways in which people defend centralization is they say like oh individuals are not like you know sophisticated enough to manage their own keys and therefore instead you know we need these big companies to manage people's accounts for them because if you screw up they can recover for you but the reality is like they don't recover for you right they just wait and wait and wait and they never reply like I've literally personally had situations where my friends came to me and told me like hey I lost my Gmail accounts because of like some lost forgotten password stolen something and I have contacted support I haven't been able to get it back for months and so basically asked me you know to use my personal no back channels to try to talk to these companies and you know get the account back and there you know successful and sometimes I'm not but like if you are someone who's not directly connected to me then you know what are you going to do right and this is you know a simple a symptom of a ",
        "11": "system whose goal is I think to ensure like some degree of trust and reputation right like the reason why a lot of services demand you know Google or Twitter accounts is be instead of just letting people sign up by themselves is because they want to prevent spam right and the problem that ends up happening is that you know they do this and and it does prevent spam but it will and it sometimes is not even that effective at preventing spam because you know there are sites where you can go and buy 100 Gmail accounts for like 100 or 200 bucks but you know there's a lot of like legitimate users who are just in context that they were totally not thinking about with it when they came up with the system that just end up being completely screwed by this right A lot of these systems are America Centric and if you're in the wrong country you know you can't like sometimes you don't even get SMS code so you know there's just all ",
        "12": "kinds of issues that I've seen right and the question you have to ask is like well what's a good alternative and to me decentralization actually does provide a good alternative and by when I say decentralization I don't just mean the kind of more you know maximalist trust no one you know everyone has to buy up a brick of titanium and carve their 12 words into that titanium and you know protect that thing with here to your wife all by themselves kind of decentralization like I mean relying on Community Trust right and uh you know Community Trust is something that exists everywhere in the world and you know in emerging economies it often it's like it's often something that people are more used to relying on than they are in you know let's say places like America where people are much more used to the Paradigm of oh you know if you need something either the government provides it or some big company provides it and you go sign up and fill in the forms right and Community Trust is like ",
        "13": "powerful because um you know you know your friends your friends are you know care about you your friends are less likely to betray you your friends are not going to just uh you know sit on your message for three months and never respond if you tell them that hey you lost your accounts and this is important and uh generally I think like I personally you know am much more comfortable relying on a collection of my friends to do things like be the backup for my ethereum account then you know some faceless big Corporation right and that like those kinds of applications that you know try to leverage local Community Trust um and then try to in some cases you know use that kind of trust directly right so like you know it talks about like I've talked about things like uh multi-sig wallets social recovery wallets like basically wallets where that are forms of self-custody so you don't have to trust a centralized actor you know like FTX or by an answer Mount gox uh with uh you know all of your ",
        "14": "funds but at the same time you know you don't have to put all of the trust into yourself right you can say oh I have this account and I have the key but if I lose the key I'm going to specify let's say seven friends and family members and you need four of them or five of them to recover your key if your key gets lost right this is called social recovery you can do it there's wallets to do it already or if you want to protect against that well I'm gonna put my coins we're gonna have six key is I control two of the keys by family and friends can show the other four keys and you need four signatures to move the money right so like even if you kidnap me I only have two keys and you know like I can't even move them like give give you the money by myself right but on the other hand you know if I um you know something terrible happens to me then you know at least these uh other people can you know come together and recover the funds and then if I lose one or two of my devices then other people can help you recover if one of my devices gets stolen then like that one key is not ",
        "15": "enough to steal anything right so you know you could use Community Trust and you know trust relationships that you already have to create things that are more secure than both these centralized institutional approaches and this kind of other um you know like what I've called on Twitter this sort of Milton man approach of you know I'm gonna buy a big um you know tungsten plate and carve my 12 uh 12 words into a piece of uh tungsten myself and you know leave it in my basement and I hope I don't forget it if I ever have to move houses so I mean I personally um you know move residences on average once every 10 days in the past like nine and a half years so uh you know it's that like being the Mountain Man approach is like even more impractical for me than it is for other people right so like this is something that for me like isn't even ideological or theoretic like it's something that I feel is a use case that's important for me and I think it's a a use case that like really a lot of people in a lot of places value right like avoiding both ",
        "16": "the pitfall like getting the conveniences of and the security that you could get from centralization without of uh getting some of the insecurity and some of the systemic risk that you get from centralization right so using Community Trust like directly through things like multi-six to bring the topic back to things like SBT is right the next question is well can we use this as some kind of reputation system right so uh if you want to prove to some someone in some Far Away place that you are some like basically that you're not a nobody that you know you're not a spammer or even like prove something more specific prove that you are a unique human uh prove that you are membership you have some membership in a particular Community you have some you know specific reason to claim a right to membership in a community um so if you think about like proof of attendance protocol as one of these examples right Pope um like this is a ",
        "17": "protocol that gives you a an nft just for attending a particular event and if you have a collection of pokes that collection of pokes could basically prove that you know you actually yeah are a very active participant in a particular Community right and Popes are like I like they're not technically sold about tokens but I personally consider them soulbound and the reason why is like if you really care like you can transfer a pope but you can tell whether or not a pope has been transferred right like if you see that you know like if you check that I have a pope right so like I have a pope representing my participation in the uh Edelweiss Workshop which is an ethereum research Workshop that happens in Austria back in January right and if you go on the blockchain and check my bulb you can see that that Pope has not been moved yet but if you know someone else wants to pretend that they're an ethereum researcher and they pay me 5 000 bucks ",
        "18": "for the pope and you know I'm feeling greedy that day and I sell it to them for five thousand bucks like you know like stuff like this actually like isn't Real World Concern right like I yeah I actually remember reading a yeah I think it was an article on arrestofworld.org or like one of those sites I I think it was even actually about Africa that talked about how one of the safety problems in ride sharing is basically that like drivers get high reputation accounts and then end up selling them right so like the soul balance thing is like basically how do we try to prevent that from happening right and here you know in the case of pokes well what happens is you can tell on the blockchain whether or not the pope has been transferred between different accounts and then now sometimes you know transferring between accounts is like a legitimate thing you want to do if you want to like change wallets but then the idea would be that there's this concept of like Community recovery you could even ask the issuer of the original Pope and tell him like Hey you know even you know even through an automatic process like hey I switched wallets and you know please confirm this for me and like you ",
        "19": "could do a lot of things to try to sort of distinguish between you know transfers that are just people transferring for themselves and transfers that are people actually trying to sell the thing right and so if you have a rich ecosystem of these sold-bound tokens proof of attendance tokens proof of humanity tokens um you know proof of balance of a specific token you know prove that you have like at least five optimism tokens to prove that you care a little bit at least a little bit about the optimism Network right like these kinds of if you have a rich ecosystem of these kinds of things then that enables a lot of applications that enables a lot of applications that have to do with uh definitely kind of like carrying trust across a large distance is right like if you just pop into a very distance community and you know you want uh evidence that like for example me you know you should be allowed to participate in some Meetup where you know the goal of that Meetup just happens to be some like a very you know ",
        "20": "in-depth discussion of some of some particular topic and they want people that you know are actually experiencing that topic and like you can go and prove that right so let's uh you know think of you know the benefits that like you know Universe like being able to prove University degrees might give for example but instead of having this kind of you know very centralized and very limited credential based system where there's only one kind of institution that gives you this sort of like proof of aptitude and because of that you know lots of people get pushed into the University track even if it doesn't necessarily benefit them you kind of expand it out and you know theoretically yeah any kind of activity that you do that represents being part of a community learning about learning about some particular thing demonstrating experience in some particular thing can actually be you know be something that you carry with you and you can create proofs about right so that like so I think there is this kind of very big collection of different pieces that tie ",
        "21": "together right like I yeah one one of the most articles that I wrote a few months ago this was uh the title it was on vitalik.ca my blog and the title was uh what in the ethereum application ecosystem excites me and one of them basically was the ethereum identity ecosystem right and uh like I don't view these things as individual pieces right like I don't like I actually think the biggest benefit of all of these things so sign in with ethereum as a replacement to sign in with Twitter um ens as a way to give yourself a name on ethereum um sold down tokens proof of attendance tokens proof of humanity as a kind of reputation and zero knowledge proves to be able to make proofs about all of these things while protecting your privacy look these are all pieces of the ecosystem that really fit together with each other right and uh once one of them exists and becomes stronger the others really become more powerful so like it's not something that one single project can accomplish but it's something where ",
        "22": "the more smaller projects there are the more they can plug into each other and the more we can you know really create this kind of more open Fair decentralized replacement for a lot of the existing centralized systems that have these kind of you know reputation and Trust mechanics as their purpose that actually you know delivers better results because it uses information that these exist the centralized mechanisms ignore but at the same time is also a more more inclusive so this is one of the things that like I personally find fascinating and extremely and an extremely applicable uh in Kenya as well I've met so many young Kenyans who are Architects and all of that and uh um doing a whole lot of work online by based on their on-chain reputation um so that's I think that's really amazing uh there's a lady there oh okay I think he's choosing ",
        "23": "like I'm hello my name is Lucy and I have two questions so what are some of the most exciting and Innovative use cases for ethereum that you have witnessed and also how do you see the role of ethereum in the development of decentralized finance and what opportunities and challenges do you foresee thank you I think it is a one like a really important thing about the idea of exciting applications is that I think it's important to separate exciting and useful and like lots of exciting things are useful but at the same time it's important to remember that lots of useful and lots of really important things are like from the perspective of someone who's been in the space for a long time kind of boring right so like ",
        "24": "one example of this is that just very simple Bare Bones Financial applications are something that is very important for a lot of people and it's even more important for people here it is for people in wealthy countries right because you know if you're in wealthy countries there's lots of financial rails that work well you know you have you know ACH in the United States you have sipa the single Euro payments you're up in area in Europe you have very fast connections between some of these wealthier zones and like there are problems but it's not that bad but once you start going out of those kind of very well connected regions I mean the the problems with existing via you know Financial systems uh start to multiply it becomes harder to send money internationally a lot there's a lot of countries that suffer from high levels of inflation and in those cases just storing and saving money is something that's like a valuable service for people and this is something that's like very easy to not think about in the US right like in the US people freak out ",
        "25": "about um you know eight percent to hear inflation and meanwhile you know like uh you know ten thousand kilometers South in Argentina people like consider 80 a month inflation normal and you know there's this uh kind of big extremes you know you know these two big extremes right and like the more the closer you are to you know those kinds of places the more you appreciate that just even being able to you know save dollars or even being able to have save in a cryptocurrency which goes up and down instead of a cryptocurrency which or instead of a fiat currency which goes down and down like that's you know valuable right and so I think it's like important to be respectful of just like that kind of uh simple stuff and like remember that the simple stuff is useful to people and I think there are exciting things that kind of are that go around the simple stuff and focus on making the simple stuff better um so I talked about social recovery wallets and multi-sig wallets there's a ",
        "26": "technology called account abstraction that like to me for me technology perspective is very exciting from the point of view as a user one of the big practical benefits is that it just makes it much easier for my user experience point of view to actually use these kinds of wallets right so that's one example of something that's valuable you can share more about account abstraction um sure um so the idea of okay so the idea behind account abstraction is that today there are two kinds of wallets in ethereum or two kinds of accounts in ethereum there are what's called eoas externally owned accounts and there are smart contracts and eoa is an account that's just controlled by a private key right so if you have opened metamask or a brave or like any other like a kind of you know self-custody ethereum wallet and you've gone through the experience of spinning up an accounts writing down a 12 word passphrase all of these things right you probably have an account that is an Ela an eoa is an account that is controlled ",
        "27": "by a private key a private key is like this you know big long 80-digit number that is saved inside of your wallet and you can regenerate it from your seed phrase and the account is directly controlled by that private key if you have the private key you can you can suspend whatever you want from the account if someone else hacks the private key they can spend whatever they want for the account and if you lose your private key then no one can send it spend everything anything from the account right so this is like what I call this kind of Fairly fragile now-to-man approach now the other kind of account is a smart contract wallet a smart contract wallet is an or at a smart contract in general is an account that's controlled by a piece of code so instead of there being a private key where if you sign something with that private key you can do things there is a piece of code and when you set a transaction to that uh that contract the code executes and the code can then do things on behalf of the account right so instead of the account being controlled by whoever gets you owns the key the account is controlled by a piece of code ",
        "28": "you can think of it as being like a little tiny extremely simple robot that lives on the blockchain that has this like very fixed transparent piece of code that could do you know usually one or a couple of things and that's all that it can do so you smart contract wallets are what you're using if you're using social recovery or multisig or any one of these kind of more complicated and safer ways of storing and using your funds um so the ethereum foundation wallet for example is a multi-sig wallet there are seven keys and there is a rule that says if you want to send a small amount of money any one of the Seven Keys can do it by itself but if you want to send a large amount of money four out of seven have to approve right so this is actually very similar to how Banks work but it's uh you know even more secure you have even more keys it doesn't depend on a centralized bank and you know it actually does deliver like a lot of security and a lot of convenience for the ethereum foundation at the same time which is like really has been amazing for us right but this is this is a smart ",
        "29": "contract the rules that say here are the seven keys the number of them that you need to sign big transactions is for the number of them we need to sign small transactions is one and here is what we mean by big and small these are all rules that are in code the problem with smart contract wallets though is that they are more difficult to use because the rules of the ethereum protocol do not let you send transactions from a contract directly every transaction has to start from an Ela right so anyway external accounts controlled by a private key so if you want to use a Smart quadruck wallet you have to also have an Ela you have to have ether in that eoa to pay for gas you have to send transactions from the eoa you have to pay an extra 21 000 gas to verify the signature over here the tools that don't have good support for it and there's like a lot of like extra complexity that you pay and this is what's preventing a lot of people from using it so it basically says that you can use the smart wallets in exactly the same way that you could use external accounts you could sedge ",
        "30": "transactions that go directly to them right so this is like a very powerful thing that unlocks the ability to use these smart contract while it's in a very cheap and user-friendly way for regular people to store their funds and makes it possible for us to make that kind of wall with the default for new users so that's I think the yeah dream of a lot of people in the ethereum ecosystem right so um that's an example of like something that to me is exciting to me as a user it's exciting to me as like a technology geek it's exciting but it still wraps around the simple piece of like functionality which is like hey I have a wallet and I want to keep it safe and for most people my wallet just holds money stores money and sends money right you know sometimes you know your wallet might hold at nfts and that's you know more interesting sometimes your wallet might participate in D5 that's more interesting but even if you use the simple stuff you benefit in the case of D5 like I think I also have this view that simple Defy is good ",
        "31": "and complicated D5 is bad like my view is that the really like old D5 project stuff that has existed in the space for more than four years maker uniswap you know the the stuff that we've kind of grown to you know and love if we've been in ethereum since forever that stuff has actually been safe it has not you know lost people's money and lots of people really have benefited from it and it provides a valuable service newer stuff that tries to say oh I'm going to be clever and I'm going to do clever tricks to try to give people an 11 interest rate well it gives you an 11 interest rate for a little bit sometimes it even gives you a 19 interest rate for a little bit and then comes this one week where you get a minus 99.99 percentage or straight and this is the problem with complicated stuff complicated stuff is fragile right and so I'm a big believer that like the simpler Defy is actually the place where 90 of the value lies and it's the place ",
        "32": "where 10 of the risk will relies right and so what we really want is not more complicated D5 what we want is tools to make simpler simple defy easy to use for regular people the other complicate the the other kind of new thing that I think actually excites me zero knowledge proofs zero knowledge proofs are incredibly powerful privacy is probably one of the biggest weaknesses of the blockchain aside from scalability and security once uh and you can think of privacy for transactions but then the problem gets even worse once you start thinking about privacy for doubts for example right so in a functional democracy one of the really core ideas is this concept of a secret ballot right when you vote for someone you don't nobody else nobody else knows who you voted for in fact you can't even prove to someone else who you voted for even if you want to this makes it much more difficult for people to force you to vote for someone this makes it much more difficult for people to sell their votes which will lead to the the richest people having much more votes than everyone else and this is like really ",

        "36": "Public Funding mechanisms like especially I mean today but I think it was even worse five years ago like imagine that you're an idealistic developer and you really care about building something that's decentralized well if you build something that's decentralized you've just kicked out 90 of your possible routes to building a VC friendly model that can raise a lot of money and most of the remaining routes involve me I'm issuing a token right and like tokens are sometimes okay and I think like the benefits of a really economically empowering communities and making cancer putting them in positions where they don't have to make even worse compromises is something that can sometimes be underrated and so so I think tokens Can sometimes be good in probably even like more situations than some other people would say they can be but at the same time tokens have a lot of downsides and there are projects where tokens aren't even realistically an option right I'm like one of my things is that like I want to ",
        "37": "see a world where fewer people try to build Empires and more people try to build tools but the problem is that people build umpires because they've been taught to build Empires by the Silicon Valley investment ecosystem because Empires are monetizable right and um you know there's the whole kind of like you know Cult of becoming the next big Google and you just know that you know building an empire is the only way to get like you know to get your VC Master some probability of that juicy 50 billion dollar pail that they're after and uh if you build a tool no matter how successful your tool is like you could you could try to Pivot to being an Empire eventually and like maybe you could argue that unislav kind of did this to some extent because they started off being a very dumb tool but then they expanded started adding fees started adding a Dao the Dow started doing things and they're in a position to launch other tools and services and all of this right but like it really hampers your ability to do that and so you want mechanisms that are willing to fund tools even if they know that a tool is all that that tool is ever going to be ",
