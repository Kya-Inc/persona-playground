        "1": "protest Kiev Tech Summit is a message and I think the message really carries the unbreakable Spirit of Ukraine uh and it's just a really a strong example of the fact that Ukraine will continue to innovate and ship incredible technology and steps forward ultimately no matter what so first of all I would love if we can have a round of applause for Ukraine [Applause] so we have had over 500 hackers uh join us over the last few days both in real life here in Kiev and also standing with Ukraine from all over the world we've had over 30 incredible speakers and we have some incredible ones actually coming up uh it's been an absolute privilege to have them share their knowledge and Spotlight all of the incredible work that's being done as a part of this movement and overall I'm ",
        "2": "just so so excited uh at what's left to come uh to finish on uh really I don't want to talk too much I am incredibly grateful for everybody here and everybody that's hacked together to make this a reality I'm also really proud of the project submissions actually roughly speaking around 50 hackathon projects have been submitted in the spirit of helping Ukraine and helping with these efforts which I think is phenom nominal and overall I'm just incredibly excited and happy to be here today so thank you so much everyone [Applause] um foreign ",

        "7": "brother ",
        "8": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm very proud and excited to welcome vitalik to this stage as well as yeah I'll explain it first question that I would love to ",
        "9": "start with and probably that's a question that everyone has and that's three metallic why did you decide to come to Ukraine and is it your first time here it is my first time here um and I uh and definitely have been you know following uh Ukraine closely basically you know ever since the the whole War started um and I mean a couple of months ago I heard about this uh Tech Summit that was uh you know you guys were organizing and I mean I was just very impressed by the fact that you know you would even be willing to just you know go and host a tech Summit in in the middle of a war you know it's uh you know definitely you know be brave like Ukraine so so I um wanted to comment uh you know both I see for myself you know what kinds of projects that people here are up to uh what and you know what kinds of things people care about what kinds of things that people are building ",
        "10": "um you know like what kinds of applications like blockchain and uh web3 you know ethereum technology it would die um what would find here I mean I mean of course also to you know just to help you know you let Ukraine know that you know the lots of people in the league in the ethereum in the crypto world I mean I really care about your guys and you know lots of people love and support you we're all incredibly grateful for that and that's indeed means a lot for Ukraine I'd love to take a step back and um hear from you Alex since the minister of judicial transformation been helping Ukraine for a very long time and especially the crypto has been instrumental in the health during the wartime and could you share more about you know how crypto has helped Ukraine since the invasion you know from Community Capital and coordination standpoint ",
        "11": "well I think the major example which was mentioned before the nickel fullerf is is a crypto fund and it's unprecedental and I think it's the first time in human history the cryptos used to refer such important matters and the impact was more than significant uh again as Michael mentioned uh it's more than 100 million dollars which uh went for mostly to support our army but a lot of humanitarian needs and in such desperate times in the and especially it was remarkable actually when this all started in first week of the war crypto appears to be almost the only way to get supplies from uh outside of Ukraine and obviously we didn't have those things and the things inside um but today I think we saw much more ",
        "12": "examples than uh than just crypto fund alone We Do It generally like we we now cooperate with the European blockchain government initiative called FC in trying to build Solutions and again on the Registries um moving them to a blockchain looking forward to bringing this transparency and accountability for for government for government data and so on well I think from from the community standpoint um I know we finally realized how big it is how it's impactful uh and it turns out that almost all crypto companies in the world have ukrainians co-founders ctOS and and just regular people that work for those companies and of course customers so ",
        "13": "that's uh that's um also I think the the spirit of community and what we're fighting for our values they reflect uh um or they kind of synchronize with what we as Ukrainian uh fighting for it's also Independence it also again the freedom transparency and this I think that's a spirit of the whole crypto community and and I think that's the reason why they support us um well I might stop here thank you yeah even very vocal since today one I remember that you've been you know sharing the right information asking the crypto Community to be active and I wonder you know how do you feel and what do you think about you know overall situation ",
        "14": "an overall situation in one sense like what's happening in Ukraine and how crypto Community reacts to that again I think uh one well one of the Asia things that I think like impressed me about Ukraine itself I think like the obvious way the the biggest kind of in the public narrative and kind of the very important one is it's a country that's doing an excellent job you know very bravely environmentally defending itself but also you know there's this kind of other side where this is a country where there's uh people who really understand Tech and you know people who really understands the latest tech like even at the highest levels of government um it's a yes spirit that I think even exists some across many places in Central and Eastern Europe I remember visiting Estonia about five years ago and just uh you know being very impressed by the e-residency digital identity and the integration of banking ",
        "15": "and you know just like from my visit today here it's queer that you know exactly the same stuff is you know being built like very quickly here and it looks like you know it might even and ends up overtaking what's happening in Estonia so I think I know there's a combination of you know both the you know a country that's in a great need of uh very yeah just being being able to very quickly work with and try to figure out a new approach as to solving it's uh um its problems together with kind of this willingness and to hunger to actually yeah look at you know both uh you know web 3 and crypto but you know also just all kinds of new technologies you know like even you know like starlink as I was mentioned before and like just about everything in this space so and from the point of view of the crypto space I think uh like one of the ways that I see all this um is that like one of the ",
        "16": "weaknesses of the crypto space is that like sometimes especially in Bull markets the kind of the financial and speculative aspects that kind of gets ahead of the technology right and you know when the the price of like you know Bitcoin and Ethan assets just keeps going up you know 20 a month for an entire year then like people start to miss a lot of people get into the mindset that like you know this like that is the point of the technology and like you know you get into like just to you know make money off of stuff in the short term and you know people start creating tokens where they guarantee that it will you know give you an interest rate of 19 every year and then of course you know it's totally not sustainable and it breaks um but uh so I think it's important for the for our hike industry to have these kind of down to earth moments of uh remembering that you know there are very real and important things that the technology is doing and uh you know when you know ",
        "17": "bubbles pop right but I think uh sustainable long-term utility is something that can last forever and this is something I remember like really feeling on my yeah visit to Argentina as well at the end of last year right uh like argentinians you know they suffer from like high inflation the country has averaged about 30 percent annual inflation for at least the last two decades I think it might even be over the last century or something like that Third Rate and and that's a a country that has a you know both like just very smart and capable people but you know also those environments that just makes it very difficult for them to and you know survive and just Prosper economically and a lot of them just manage to use like blockchain and cryptocurrency tools to you know do uh for just you know running their businesses you know giving money to their families doing what they need to do and you know even uh a lot of argentinians are kind of very up at the top uh like leading very important crypto projects that benefit ",
        "18": "the whole world and you know this is something that I'm I think you know we've been seeing on even a whole other level here right it's uh you know the uh like this isn't just a government that's uh set a couple of nice things about cryptocurrency for PR value you know this is a yeah no country that's like really actually made use of the API technology and like Sean can use it to do things that uh a lot existing uh Financial systems just did not provide um I mean there's uh a lot of uh I mean not even just the governments just you know lots of different independent groups and I mean like Unchained and Ukraine Dao and all of these amazing efforts that just self-organizing uh to just meet all of the um all of the new various needs that people have and I think the many people in The Wider crypto community and like see that and I think it's even you know motivating to people uh outside of ",
        "19": "Ukraine that you know these things actually can happen and you know like this is the sort of thing that the crypto space is building for you know not like trying to you know make a 19 interest rates every year so definitely I think the the overall coordination of the crypto Community was it's been fascinating since the Devon um all of my friends the crypto you know projects that I've been involved in a lot of those gathered together to help Ukraine and moving forward Alex what do you think it's next for web Tree in terms of you know the war in human turning efforts and a special sort of the Innovative startup ecosystem you already touched on you know some of the projects I've been building so before moving to web trade it's just I just failed to mention one of the things about the previous question another example was um using uh crypto and blockchain Technologies to help refugees there was two particular examples when a stellar ",
        "20": "blockchain and on uh and binance using their stable coin when we organized we together with un actually helped to refugees to to address the help using crypto specifically to those who left Ukraine and they need and that that was also a remarkable question and answering what crypto gave Ukraine about web tree and this is going to give was going to give to Ukraine so we have a couple of things Nicola said we don't want to disclose uh much of them because it's where every year we hold a d assignment and this is the place where we reveal all their Technical Innovations what I can answer here that we definitely look into it and we study ",
        "21": "I can just give a broad answer we study every aspect of it and how we can implement it working together with with business with companies with crypto companies from Ukraine mostly and but we open to actually to anybody and trying to get around like of their specific part of the technology and how we can use it to benefit ukrainians and the government um so I really apologize I can give precise answer but uh um as I mentioned before we you'll be surprised I'm very looking forward to it um italic here built one of the largest crypto networks in the world and I wonder obviously it's your first time in Ukraine and still you are part of the crypto community and you've seen that there's a lot of you know ukrainians building their crypto Networks do you think that Ukraine could become ",
        "22": "the next you know that tree hub Asia I think it absolutely can um I think one of the differences between like crypto and like AI for example right is and they're like there's great AI everywhere but I think um on average like AI projects and you know they yeah tends to concentrate you know they're either in the Bay Area or um you know in one of the mega cities in China and crypto is just very different because it's not like that at all right it's uh you know the the ethereum foundation's given our American Hub is in Denver um and I mean our development development Hub is in Berlin you know we have people in Singapore people in Taipei um people and uh like half the guest team is in Romania and so it's impossible for in fact just about any country like if people are determined to like really step up and make a big impact in the space so I think you know yes absolutely and I think you know Ukraine both has both the ability and ",
        "23": "the yeah the determination it's become a great crypto Hub if it wants to a follow-up question for you italic in terms of the startup ecosystem of Ukraine how do you see the ethereums roll into that ethereum role in in the in the startup ecosystem of Ukraine the ethereum Project's role um like ethereum as you know the foundation and ethereum adoption sure and so I guess just talk a bit about the ethereum foundation uh like our general philosophy is to like not try to grow into you know like a like a big elephant ourselves rightly yeah some middle ethereum Foundation directly has like maybe about 200 employees um but you know if you compare that with like binance has over three thousand um you know Kraken and coinbase have like somewhere between one thousand and five thousand I forget the numbers um like the foundation spends more money on grants than it does on its uh ",
        "24": "internal staff and you know it's intentional kind of we believe in you know the philosophy of a decentralized ecosystem and they're trying to empower this local groups um everywhere to pursue their own visions and you know give them the resources and you know both financial and you know kind of Technical and just other other kinds of help that they need so I think you know that puts us as a foundation I mean the definitely any good place to or tried you know figure out what kind what kinds of local groups that make sense to collaborate with and you know in what way there's a definitely you know projects and like other countries and even in Latin America that we're starting to do that I think could be a USD as a model for that sort of thing um it's uh this is this is something that we are kind of growing into over time right so like three or four years ago for example you know I think the foundation was just not any position at all to work with anyone and I think you ",
        "25": "know unfortunately we did kind of have to disappoint people because you know people were you know very cheerful and you know hey you know we you know love crypto and ethereum and you know what can we do next and uh you know rewards really in a good place to do anything except um you know maybe recommends them to like talk to Joe at consensus but you know things have improved a lot and they think they're continuing to improve and it's like in the ecosystem in general like the foundation is only one of many different groups right you know there's a eth global that organizes hackathons everywhere there's uh you know all kinds of just local community groups in various uh different Amino cities and parts of the world and they talk to each other if there's enough people you know in the foundation in one place then you know that kind of turns into a kind of like a de facto base for the ethereum ecosystem ",
        "26": "and so I think uh like our the approach that word wants to have is to just find ways to like create more links between the local Ukrainian community and you know the the smartest and most amazing researchers in ethereum lands anywhere right you know all of the people you know whether it's working on you know zero knowledge technology or like cryptography and like or you know the yeah consensus and like protocol side of things and you know once those connections are made you know that typically ends up in just being a big boost for uh for everyone on both sides Alex I know that the ministry of digital transformation doing a lot and continues to in terms of the onboarding and that's such a important topic right and and crypto the onboarding is a huge challenge right now I wonder could you hear more about sort of concrete plans the ministry of digital transformation house in terms of ",
        "27": "you know the onboarding focused on the tech the crypto that tree and the startup ecosystem well those things really connected well our top priority task right now is the Finish to legislation issues during the War President signed the law on Virtual assist I think that's one one of the things showing that how it's important so in the times of War when Russian invasion is in full-scale president signing this this bill this is this is how we as a government of Ukraine think about the importance of this of this topic and um our goal right now is to finish the taxation um issues with on the legislative level and I think we we're moving there's so many complex things and we uh Frankly Speaking overestimated uh the the ",
        "28": "deadlines and despite of the war of course we can use this as excuse but there's a lot of complexities to finally put this eventually making it uh the regular thing like anything else like your like regular money or I don't know virtual assets to be the part of Ukrainian legislative system but we but the reason I think we went too far because we we're not thinking about crypto itself we were thinking about this as as a new way of uh um on the new but maybe not a way but new instance and we call it uh virtual assets for a reason because it's not just about crypto it's it's about the whole economy and about the future things and one of the one of the examples why we and what proved this approach right because when we started there was no nfts and there's no any like no one actually working with nfts uh but back in the days like two years ago uh together with ",
        "29": "a group of thinking there's gonna be definitely one day gonna be something new so we don't have to close just for the crypto and um it appears we were right because nft um now we're talking about web3 things maybe like not diverse things and uh I said that I want to disclose things but another verse is very close to what are we uh thinking about from from the web tree elements uh and and government services so uh this is our top priority right now and we're working together with our Security Commission with National Bank and hoping to finish this uh till the end of the year also uh as a government thing that there should be two and metallic actually mentioned this uh um building Community is it is one of the priorities we obviously understand it's trying to be realistic that while we are have a risk of the rocket strike ",
        "30": "or something it's it's hard to build and making events like this a in a normal way uh but also the second pillar that we think about is funding so our another priority is to find enough money for every startup in this country and both using uh government money from let's say Ukrainian startup fund from European Union from United States is a government help but also uh from a private institutions and um next week you're going to hear very good news about that and I think it's going to be first time in history that private fund this size I'm not making a nonsense yet but there's going to be huge news next week yeah so and we're working towards uh such examples which we'll hear next week to you uh because we believe that in order to develop startup ecosystem including ",
        "31": "web tree and and uh all this like subsection we have to have enough capital that's that's what we totally clearly understand in every day working towards this goal thank you would you like to add anything metallic I don't know I'm trying to think what I should add that I haven't said already um you know any any specific questions in mind I think we can move to another very interesting topic um Central Bank digital currencies I'd love to start from you italic well yeah this is a fun one I guess no no I think it's it's a complicated topic right because I mean I'll be like I'll be honest and I'll admit that like what I've seen out of the cbdc space has been a disappointment so far um I think the like basically what I've seen is that uh the the space like started with this kind of very uh you ",
        "32": "know idealistic Vision that um you know we're going to give create these digital currencies that are you know directs to Consumers we can disintermediate Commercial Banking like drastically simplify the financial system you know we reduce the risk of uh you know many kinds of financial crisis and uh but you know that and like that's kind of how a lot of things started but then when you follow the pro of the the projects and you know look at what happens to them over time right like first of all you know they yeah they never end up doing a blockchain and uh like what's they it's not even just that like oh ethereum is too expensive we want to make a private chin no no like they yeah you know they don't even end up doing a miracle tree like okay you know like you don't even have authentication right and then the the whole idea of like uh you know being directs to Consumer like in all of the different exp different uh projects I've seen it ends up falling away and I mean we started bringing commercial Banks into the middle of the system and ",
        "33": "then you know okay I remember I was talking to the dcep people in China like back in 2014 and 15 and at the time they were kind of very excitedly you know interacting with the crypto space and trying to like understand you know what would it what would it take for them to like make a blockchain digital currency and then fast forward five years and like what they've made is honestly just a Corona Valley pay right and like what's the point uh so like I think you know theoretically it's very possible for a central bank digital currency it's in like actually be something better than you know like just another payment processor but this is uh I think something where like you know he actually yeah have to like I you know I look forward to seeing someone you know like actually innovate and try and try to figure this out since yeah probably is a person who spent 100 hours on the consultation and the ways to figure out how to implement cbdc in Ukrainian reality I totally support what ",
        "34": "italic said it's really complicated I see a lot of benefits and together with the National Bank we actually started decided to start a pilot a small pilot out to your Implement cbdc in Ukrainian um Financial system and actually from the August this year our national bank is able to create sandboxes according to the law that they passed through the parliament almost a year ago and we had a lot of plans for that I mean using this sandbox and trying to bring some cbdc projects on Ukrainian soil and of course on 24 February ruined those plans a lot because those projects were postponed but give you more like maybe give any more specifics we decided to um to use to try three blockchains ethereum stellar and ",
        "35": " I forgot third uh whatever uh but uh we wanted to do the same um task on the three blockchains and test them out um this is uh this is still in development but again um it it raised so many questions from from the commercial system from uh from society one one of the examples from like really comes from uh social uh aspect of this uh of this question because at some point we realized that people are not ready to this so if you do a perfect technical solution um most likely it's going to fail because they are not ready to adopt it and use it in real life so this is just one of the examples that we face during this um I don't know like as I mentioned with hundreds of hours of uh moving around ",
        "36": "this topic but I believe that it's it's a great thing and and at some point uh Ukraine is going to move to cbdc our President also said that he's one of his priorities that he want to build cashless economy and I think cbdc's should be and I think it's a crucial part of make moving cashless that's my personal point but I I believe a lot of people in the government also share this very interesting take during the war time we've seen that crypto isn't just about financial side and that's something I'm very happy that a lot of people start to realize and I wonder we talk that's a question to you how can we better leverage or use you know the VAP tree to find you know propaganda ensure the censorship resistance ensure that we store their you know the truthful right ",
        "37": "information and especially preserve let's say the the history of Ukraine and the culture yeah no it's a definitely a good question I mean I think this uh I mean it gets into this like discussion about like blockchains for um like you know non-financial applications in general and I think you can look at it in a few different ways right like one like this the easiest thing we can do right is to just like fun create ways to kind of automatically hash different uh images into the yeah you know create some kind of like hash link that gets them you know rooted in you know the Bitcoin chain or the ethereum chain or actually you know why not both because you only need one hash in each for any number of messages and then you have some proof that you know it was created before some amount of time um and I think I mean actually in the era of you know things like deep learning and stable diffusion like it it's uh it becomes more important to like have a sort of more cryptographic evidence about you know when pictures ",
        "38": "were produced to us and to make sure that like they're not um AI fakes so that's uh kind of one way to look at it sort of purely technical um correctness and then the other way to like thing to ask is uh could like some kind of you know web3 technology be used to create social media platforms that I do a better job of like promoting um you know content that's you know correct and then and then not fake but at the same time you know like doing it anywhere um in a way that's like fair and that um all of the users can like you know have some perception that it's uh being being done in a way that's like unbiased and not just I mean manipulated by a whoever's running it and uh I think I mean they're they're definitely are like interesting um technologies that um could be used there like you know both uh and like blockchain based things and ",

        "40": "starting from the concept following their implementation I think it's it's uh it's one of the things that's most amazed me the most um I I I'm not sure if you're familiar with the yes we're very good friends so um but just maybe just give a few words to the audience because if you're not familiar this is just a fascinating thing so um the nft museum is um is attempt to create a sequence of events of the war starting from 20th of February um connecting every nft to the specific news item in an image associated with that created by famous artists or and talented artists I'm not sure how famous they are I'm not from from this community anyway um Russia is trying to twist the history so with the um with this sequence created in in ",
        "41": "the preserving everyday events after a hundred of years we still can follow up the truth no one can actually using because blockchain is used we we're totally sure 100 sure that those events are in the right order and this is exactly what happened and you can change this I think this is this is a fascinating example of uh of how web tree Technologies can be used and and and I think that's that's the way like uh I have a son and uh he's he's 10 years old but after I don't know maybe six seven Ten to Ten Years this is the way he's going to consume the knowledge this is my belief I think that's that's the future of it thank you we all agree with you Alex and that's why we are all here making the change speaking of all of us here we're actually in a room full of hackers ",
        "42": "and those hackers been hacking for 70 hours straight Non-Stop let's first give apart thank you for those hackers who still would love to continue pushing your public goods pushing their projects in solution that help Ukraine both you know on like Vortex side and humanitarian Aid do you have any sort of specific ideas you would like them to focus on moving forward I think we have a set of problems that we facing at this point in many times of War most of them are known and but I can name few we personally faced with their procurement problems and accountability ",
        "43": "and and traceability of uh of the goods and things that comes to Ukraine and especially like in two first two weeks after the war started there's complete mess like no one know where to go like what goes through custom whether it eventually ended end up for being in which hands so I think there's solutions that help uh like establish transparency and maybe decentralize it could be relevant so the procurement stuff I think um artificial intelligence that help around the autonomous weak devices this is another huge priority for uh for Ukraine right now because again uh as against Michael farther mentioned that there's a I think we to win this war we need to be ",
        "44": "I would call us creative and uh and this is this is the part of it we have also a huge problem with the with data with government data with registers and and this is also where we need some I think some help especially when it goes because we recently achieved the status of European Union candidate so we need to adjust a lot of procedures according to European Union laws and regulations so those kind of stuff also could be priority and uh interesting um it's hard for me to say for like what my private sector needs so I'm going to pass in that sure vitalik would you like to add anything that's uh it's hard to add things I mean there's um answers are you know very ",
        "45": "comprehensive already um what kinds of things are worth working on um yeah maybe for private sector right right sector yeah yeah I think uh I mean one of them I think you know fascinating things to me about the yeah like you know both you know the Ukrainian defense and just organizing like you know things like eight for you know civilians and refugees just everything is just how much independent organizing there's going on right and uh you know there's projects like um you know Ukraine Dao projects like unchain um that have been doing a lot of good already um and I think you know there's there's a lot to be learned here about like what makes a good deal like what makes a yeah Dao um actually effective like you know are there lessons from here that can be applied to you know Dell projects and in the in the rest of uh the world in ",
        "46": "general um so I think you know creating like trying to like figure out you know what would like veteran like actually effective and you know decentralized governance platforms so look like and then we know both the kind of formal on chain side and the Asia I think you know like kind of off-chain community like communication and uh coming to cons coming to consensus side no also uh to some extent to the you know the same projects as anywhere as anywhere else like you know making it more convenient for people to just uh you know you use cryptocurrency for payments to use digital identity um to you know trying to like you know also like integrate uh kind of the yeah you know sort of ethereum identity stack with um you know some of the stuff that the uh that the ministry is working on um I think there's a lot of different kinds of things there that can be built ",
        "47": "too hmm before we move to the questions from audience prepare your questions please um I'd love to give a big shout out to all of our hackers we had more than 500 hackers signing up to hack for Ukraine both online and offline we had more than 30 plus speakers mentors joining us to share their knowledge share their expertise highlight all of the incredible work that has been done for Ukraine we also had a great volunteers Partners sponsors the organs team that helped us to make this happen and obviously huge thanks to our guests that that helped us make this event historical do you have any Alex without do you have any last you know comments a message you want to show to our hackers um yeah maybe because before moving to finance I was thinking about what else to your previous question so I think also some ",
        "48": "um Solutions in electronic democracy built on web tree Technologies also could be interesting I remember before the war we were talking with Microsoft because they developed some e-voting system on based on their knowledge and expertise in their size of course and I think they even launched in some country and we were really interested in that so that might be with development of technologies that might be interesting also for at some point it's a great example because I mean even within the ethereum foundation or at least it's like it's supported by the ethereum foundation there's this team that's working on like basically Asia blockchain and zero knowledge proof based voting platform and you know like it actually uses like both of those technologists you know like actually make the vote more secure right so you know zero zero knowledge proofs you know keep the votes private and they ensure ",
        "49": "that votes are being counted correctly the blockchain provides censorship resistance so if he wants to vote um you know you can stick your vote on chain and they have to count it and you know the zero knowledge group forces them to count it and so you don't even have to kind of trust the what the infrastructure to not ignore your vote um and you know it has the kind of all of the yeah standard properties that people you know expect out of a good voting system uh so you know it's uh Macy Maci is the name of one of these projects it's uh there's already a project trying to incorporated into a quadratic funding implementation but this sort of thing could be a minnow used for almost regular e-votes of many kinds as well you know I think you know the intersection of blockchain and ZK is I think it's it's fascinating and I think it's uh you know even more powerful than like both right like one of the reasons why is uh because uh like blockchain they give you kind of you know both like censorship resistance and ",
        "50": "like on and a certain kind of security but at the expense of scalability and privacy right like blockchains you know not very scalable and everything is public but zero knowledge proofs give you back the scalability and privacy so there are actually yeah perfect companions for uh for each other well um I totally agree and it is uh there's actually uh building um maybe I'm going to go to some specifics but I think it's it's worth to hear that um one of the obstacles uh to implement the electronic voting system in in Ukrainian uh legislation is a restriction from Constitution because it it says that every word should be confident must be confidential so I think uh this is where blockchain kind of solved this issue because you can anonymously hold a vote but the system allows you to prove that that's exactly ",
        "51": "you so uh so that's that's that's something that I was thinking about uh some time ago and this is actually why any of solutions like Microsoft fail because if you uh you can do electronic vote in Ukraine because the Constitutional restriction uh and if you move at anything to online then and you authorize the person then there's no convention confidentiality so um that's the question for hackers actually how to turn this around um and maybe it's the last thing I I really want to thank everyone during this event and thank you for um you know what like what I'm gonna say is like thank you for keep trying thank you for thinking about something new bringing this from your brain to real life and that's that's really fascinating ",
        "52": "yeah no I uh the first first of all let me know thank you guys for um inviting me this looks like it's been a yeah you know great and wonderful event and I was you know very happy to you know be able to talk a bit with the teams from the hackathons and see what kinds of projects that they're building on and then you know hackathons are often a great seat um yeah a prototype gets built um you know 72 hours but uh you know idea you know ideas uh get formed and friendships get made and they can often be the start of something that lasts for um you know more than five years so uh you know look forward to seeing what the results of all of these uh projects are going to uh turn into a year from now [Music] um you know otherwise just to keep up the good work ",
        "53": "thank you vitalik at Alex in nlx that was a fantastic panel we have a time for two three questions if anyone have a question please raise your hand [Music] hi um my name is Medina um a question to both of you do you think it is possible to decentralize the concept of government I actually uh being asked this question now the first time in my life and my answer last time was uh that I think no it didn't change much though since that time um well being at three years in the government I think that it's it's possible to um to make a decision making process is essentialized but you can rely on government which is ",
        "54": "potentialized and Ukrainian cases the best example because um we won't survive a three days if we were decentralized so the general equation there's some times in the history and it's it in some cases not the cases but at some point in some circumstances you can move to a certain digitalization like uh if everything is good I know like economy is stable and that people are smart and then and uh and they like have a mentality like in Switzerland not like in Ukraine um and I'm saying this because one particular example because when uh Switzerland were asked if they want to get um like uh minimum income uh for everyone uh they said no because they smart enough to understand that this is the way to nowhere but if you ask the ",
        "55": "same question in Ukraine most people say yes because they just want to get money for free and in this Society making decentralization is probably would not be a good idea and uh and again if you're face uh events like a war you can just you should be centralized and this is the way you win um yeah so I would stick to that thank you yeah I know I think my views are kind of similar that there is uh like I think there's some um parts of uh government that that are easier to decentralize than some parts of the government that are harder like they're just uh like there are some tasks that just like benefit um a lot from kind of central um like this decision making and the ability to kind of you know make it uh make a plan and whatever that plan is stick to it right like I think you know unfortunately the you know military is probably the best example of this right ",
        "56": "like if you have uh you know uh every every division just makes Decisions by itself then we know the other side just concentrates their forces in one place and just you know Sports the country in half so but uh you know I think there are a lot of other things that uh do um benefit from my decentralization like uh funding like many different kinds of public goods for example um it's uh like there's a lot of value in having a get a more decentralized process because then you know if what if one part of the process completely misses something then another part of the yeah process can kind of pick I pick it up right and I think like you know even like the the American like tradition of uh you know like charity and like people just independently creating like projects and just being you know very willing to donate large amounts of money to it like it's it's not perfect but I think it's uh you know one of the big advantages there right that you know people who are kind of far away from ",
        "57": "like government mentality of like thinking of what's public good you know they have their own ideas of I mean I would say yeah and you know if either one of them is right then like something gets funded right so I think uh they're like there are some kinds of uh problems where it makes a lot of sense to try you know like more decentralized and more democratic approaches of different kinds but but you know definitely not 100 percent thank you we have another question room hi uh my name is Ellie Moser I'm from New York and we came here for the hackathon and we've been building a project integrating DIA to the blockchain so we're creating on-chain identities through Dia so we're sort of de-anonymizing wild addresses through Dia and I wanted to ask a philosophical question because in the news recently there's been a lot of talk about tornado cash and the government sanctioning wild ",
        "58": "addresses so are you concerned I know Alex you're talking about having Dia and potentially on-chain identities are you concerned that in the future a non um benevolent non-benelevant government could do some sort of Crackdown on wild addresses if they're de-anonymized and instead of just sanctioning a wild address actually sanctioning a real human being well this is this is a complicated question for me quite frankly um honestly I um you got me thinking it is complicated um I don't know I I don't know I really don't know uh I'm sorry but um the questions about correcting an identities and then possessing the the data and uh well I mean the question is if we successfully create a way for on-chain ",
        "59": "identities like on-chain wall addresses to be connected to a real life person now there's all sorts of ramifications that can be done to that person for the things they've done with their wild address so I think it's really cool and something that's definitely going to be worked on in the future and our team is you know powering away on it but I'm also concerned as we work on it that perhaps there could be bad implications where people now can track those wall addresses connected to a person and crack down on them but yeah this again requires cbdc and uh what well uh well but maybe not cbdc but connecting wallets um I think that um that might be a case but I just um uh it's like social now you got me thinking I think in figure it is out uh I think it's sort of a uh very similar to what I face when I live in the US with the social ID numbers SSN numbers specifically so they also connected to the identity and everyone trying to keep ",
        "60": "it private um but because if you disclose it you can you can suffer so I I think uh this this experience of U.S government with social would be really relevant to answering your question but again as I mentioned before I can't really answer that but look into this we definitely are yeah you're from New York you know it is yeah I mean I think like this gets into a kind of the the complicated you know philosophical topic of uh privacy and like you know know I've been very supportive of efforts to improve privacy on the blockchain because I think you know at the end of the day if if everything is fully public then like it does become a dystopian right it's uh there's you know all kinds of actors are able to see just like everything that you're doing and it just uh you know becomes very easy for people to threaten each other for people to get information about each other to exploit each other and you know there's um all kinds of problems but um you know at the ",
        "61": "at the same time like there's this uh sort of question of uh you know how can we give you know regular people a high level of privacy but you know like at the same time not support um like you know two billion dollar hackers for example and um I mean I actually think that like I've actually like you know thought about this and like talked about this with a lot of people over the last couple of weeks and there are interesting approaches that can be made um so like one simple example of this is uh there's this idea of like making a version of tornado cash where when you withdraw you would also like you would you would make another proof that proves uh like that you did not come from a particular subset of deposits and so I mean the idea is that you know people would subscribe to some provider um that would uh kind of provide these subsets automatically um and then the hope is that like basically you know when the hacker you know comes in and ",
        "62": "you know puts like a billion dollars of deposits then all of the other honest users like when they uh deposited or when they withdraw like they would have this proof that just that says you know I am not one of these people and then the hacker just doesn't end up getting um anyone else to like mix their money with right and like to me this is an example of uh like a powerful thing about ZK which is how it's like simultaneously a privacy and a verifiability um technology right that you know you can both like hide information that like really should be private but at the same time uh prove information that you know he wants to prove you know whether it's to establish that you're a good actor or to like you know prove like just any kinds of things about things about yourself and um I think I'm you know the yeah both in the financial sphere and also in the identity sphere as well right uh we're going to see yeah a lot of examples of those kinds of approaches right so like it should absolutely be ",
        "63": "possible to have an identity system where you're not like leaking all of the information on Chain by default but if he wants to prove you know specific things about yourself um you know you could prove that in zero knowledge um there's uh there's even ways to like make proofs in such a way that like limits how um how many proofs that you can make right so you know like if you want to take out a loan for example then you know you'd be able to prove like I'm proving that you know I have this kind of identity but also that like I did not make like more than some number of other loans some use using this mechanism so you can't say cheat the system uh so you know a lot of options um so the reason why we were working on this is because we had a very novel way we had this novel approach to delivering Aid through loans and the question the reason that was the starting point and then we're like well we want to give this novel loan method to Ukrainian refugees but how do we prove that people are refugees and that's how we ended up with the D integration and one really cool thing that Anton um one of our devs uh figured out because we were having the philosophical ",
        "64": "discussion we're like well do we you know ping data do we ping Dia and pull the data and build our own database and then have all this knowledge in people and it doesn't seem cool because like now we are the centralized database deciding if people are acceptable or not and one of the things that we're working on is just having like a uid so that the wallet is connected and it says this wallet is connected to a real person it's connected to uid but it's not actually saying what the person's name is what their status is and so we're we have the ability then to say that this person is verifiable for a loan but we're not saying who the person is where they are anything else about them no no like it's a it's a perfect application yeah I don't know how many people who really followed this conversation sorry [Music] no I think it's time for more summer questions if you have time for one two questions yeah ",
        "65": "[Music] hello my name is Timor so on this hackathon we're making Project G Soul so we're creating Soul bound issuing platform also tie down to personality identification and users will be able to rate each other verified users by Karma points so we found out that Ukraine has a great power of crowdfunding and we proved it like by supplying our nation with funds for different projects and I have a question how do you see the next steps in forming crowdfunding in blockchain technology for example found in different businesses in real life for example you may be seen in Kiev Urban space 500 where people just like get into buying creating a business and they're all owners so how do you see in Ukraine developing this crowd found in power ",
        "66": "because like we're really strong in working together other will be this opportunity to co-own a business and just like giving in your crypto assets and becoming a part of this business because now your can be owner of this you can just like donate so how do you see in the next steps in this moment thank you um well um I've already a piece of uh work on on Soul bonds talking and it actually inspired us to add some functionality to that there's a crypto fund unfortunately we we didn't come to a real implementation but we we we discussed the concept that we can use the cell Bond tokens to award people for for the nation and then and create a mechanism as a blockchain like you distribute them based on some social achievements that were generosity or I don't know uh how they generally react ",
        "67": "to things or how to help other people or based on feedbacks on them and uh well at this point those uh we're just thinking about ideas um we had also some uh ideas about gamification um maybe it's not a good word here but it generally reflects what we thinking about like if you're I don't know if you uh well there's an example of this uh in intonation process if you donate um um like on a drones on the wings we can write the message to to Russians before they going to be hit by some bomb um or uh you can put your I don't know message on the bomb itself like for first so this is those are examples that being used widely already we I think we can move on some of them on blockchain any on the web tree ",
        "68": "but at the end we just discussing things like that um I'm I'm partially kidding but still anyway uh uh as I mentioned before I think in maybe in half a year from now maybe a little bit faster maybe a little bit longer uh you're gonna see some projects based on uh on this concept using Soul tokens because we really like this idea okay and a little bit additional question to this just a second and so I work a lot with the kids Young Generation and I would like to ask how you'll see uh like just uh from what age and like in Ukraine will it be somehow regulated from what age you'll be able to use crypto assets like do you see some development in that because the Young Generation is very interested in ",
        "69": "this they're developing and growing their potential daily I I know it's definitely younger than I was uh well I think that we actually work anyway well we now working on uh changing our school I.T lessons in in school from from the beginning and I think uh the blockchain and and um and raptree will be from the first Creator so we will start to talk about those things uh maybe not from first grade I don't quite remember but it's it's really from the young age I think uh but but my personal point of view here is uh that any person as long as it start to consume those knowledges able ",
        "70": "to consume those knowledges it deserves to know and deserves to have a right to use them um there's a separate case with the money because uh um again I have a I have a child and uh he can purchase anything because he can be easily persuade so there should be limitation but in general like if you're if you want to involve yourself but without losing assets it could be done from very young age so the problem is losing assets for a long time [Music] now I'm Alexander and I've been uh deep into decentralized Technologies uh way before the blockchain came big and my question ",
        "71": "is uh centralization brings Simplicity and also brings fragility like uh the common merge was a complex and uh deeply uh orchestrated processes is it required a lot lots of choreography from from tons of participants have you considered uh making uh scaling into a number of different competing consensus systems where where particular web 3 app can uh interact with multiple of them like like a multi-party system in a government uh and uh and scale in this way uh like uh so so you so you can uh exp so you can experiment with different systems uh so you can scale uh scale this way and uh like have a bigger risk tolerance it's it's not it won't implode Advance if something fails and uh but ",
        "72": "but but much deeper integrated that we have now with multiple chains and the bridge I guess I mean I think like Cosmo says obviously the one project that's trying to take the like multiple chain and Bridge model and uh like do a lot of attack standardization to make it like a very usable environment so like that exists and then within ethereum lands like we're trying to do something sort of like that with Roll-Ups right like roll up so they share security they yeah like they all get security and they get a data space from the ethereum based chain but they you know have the ability to kind of fully customize and you know how everything works inside of them internally so I think uh like yeah in both voices the yoga system is moving a bit in that direction already yeah thank you ",
        "73": "thank you I think we have a time for one last question who thinks he has it the most important question are you sure okay let's ask our Mentor the saluted leader distributed lab thank you for this chance my name is Herman and actually we just had a hackathon here about the ideas of how of how web3 space can help Ukraine uh in the ongoing like situation and I actually have the simple question do you have a real concrete idea so what of what could be implemented right now and right here that would really help the governments and the Army and so on because we like in the company we have the resources and the desire ",
