        "1": "cryptographic finance there's a lot of interesting research being done around zero knowledge proof there's people looking inside distributed hash tables and you know an entire sort of long list of these new technologies that are sort of philosophically ideologically I think really in the same space as what we're trying to get at you know the they're all sort of supporting is sort of very similar kinds of values decentralization empowering individuals taking out the middleman you know basically all the same things that we care about but you know if you really if you have to just be a pedantic prick about it the fact is they're not block chains at all so at the same time you know they're things that we care about so I think it's important to also sort of think about the space as being broader than you know just these things the space of technology is based based on pieces of data that contain hashes to previous pieces of data containing hashes to previous pieces of data so you know it's it's about the use of decentralized ",
        "2": "cryptographic interests minimizing technology is to improve you know freedom cooperation equality for it sort of fraternity efficiency in our lives so next question why audience because watch ins are al-qaeda's watch kids have layers so this is not just me saying if this is basically just about everyone saying it apparel you know in the past five years we've moved from block chains simply being a peer-to-peer system for moving money around to this sort of incredibly complex architecture we have different kinds of blockchain protocols then you have different kinds of network sitting on top of them you have reputation system smart contracts or data feed Oracle's side side chains tokens different kinds of financial architecture is exchanges interfaces application sitting on top of all of them and it's turning into this sort of ",
        "3": "application stack that's you know basically pretty much as complex as what we have for you know something like web applications on the Internet so next point this is what the butcher block chains crypto whatever space was like back in 2011 so you know fortunately fortunately this is the one industry where I could claim to be of a veteran that has more than more years of experience that almost almost everyone else and probably even here much less than the mainstream but you know back back when this industry was really starting you know it was this sort of motley collection of people doing things like selling alpaca socks gambling selling food for Bitcoin just because you know you people like food and people have bitcoins so you might as well you know make a make a mutually beneficial transaction to do pre to improvements or ",
        "4": "whatever um and of course you know the other kind of pre to improve the people care about which is whatever this trip quite doesn't even know so this is where we are now so you know we have banks doing experiments on blockchains we have Microsoft's you know lighting if you're allowing people to spin up a few REM notes on their cloud services bit nation has a partnership with their residency program from you know which is part of the government of estonia nasdaq is doing washing and experimentation so you know we've made a few small steps since this yeah so what's the point so you know why you know wire blockchains useful why is crypto why decentralization why everything so even outside the context of crypto things of value in the world ",
        "5": "are increasingly becoming digital so this is one sort of interesting chart to look at so this is the money supply of the euro from 1998 to 2007 and you know at the top you see your usual sort of m1 m2 m3 and at the bottom in you know currency in circulation so what this chart basically says is there currently 8 trillion you're you know and we said eight years ago there were eight trillion euros in existence and only about 600 million of them were physical cash so you know people say oh we have Bitcoin now bitcoin is we now have this revolution of you know digital virtual currencies well guess what the Euro is also 95 percent the digital virtual currency so it's been happening for 20 years now we also thanks to the internet we have assets even digital assets even digital assets that are not dying to have sort of no intrinsic backing buy anything physical in the real world you ",

        "7": "so about ten years ago there was this college student who were decided you know hey I'd like to you know actually try to go through college without ending up on tens of thousands of dollars and yeah just like everyone else so I'm gonna start a website I'm just gonna start a website create a million pixels you know with just an image thousand by thousand and I'm going to sell each of those pixels for a dollar and guess what he did it and he managed to sell these our website and he's a millionaire now so you know next time someone says making money is hard here's another interesting one so top five instances of some kind of crowd-sourced project funding you know crowd fun crowd sale whatever you want to call it in the world so now of course you know I am the founder of the number four there aetherium but the point here isn't actually to sort of use the Wikipedia page as as of example of how great if your aim as the point is actually something completely different so out of ",
        "8": "these five projects three of them sold you know plain old physical items the sort of stuff that you know if someone from the Roman Empire were suddenly sort of teleported in he'd be able to at least understand why people would want to pay for it you know of course you'd want to pay for something that gives you time a hundred times more accurate than a sundial on your hand that's like cool it's new technology but number four sold sixty million digital tokens whose value is to pay for computational cycles in a decentralized computer network it's not selling that it's not selling the computers it's not even providing anything in the network it's it's providing its selling tokens that party a uses to pay party B both of whom are just people I need anywhere in the community and you know in order to gain this this completely digital resource of having the right to send transactions inside of inside of the etherium network that perform computations number one is even more fun ",
        "9": "ninety million dollar is the last time I checked which is a few hours ago it's up to 99 million sold virtual spaceships in their online game for five hundred dollars so what's so this is our world this is 21st century now what's the problem so you know our systems for dealing with these assets they're often insecure they're not interoperable the alive global usability on their outdated that's basically the problem statement and this is the problem statement expressed in a in a set of screenshots of recent news articles passwords get I get reset a major certificate authorities get hacked by random people from Iran customer details get stolen all the time so you know how can block chains help so this is the sort of story that we usually hear this idea of walk shades as a Trust machine so you know ",
        "10": "the idea is that blog chains kind of allow for running application logic on a completely trustworthy platform so they allow you to build systems that are you know extreme that are basically more trustworthy than any single participant in in the ecosystem in which they exist you know none of us have to be as reliable and s trustworthy as all of us together so that gives you a strong guarantee that applies for and will not arbitrarily change its functionality it's not going to sort of start extracting monopoly rents it's not going to bait-and-switch you it's not going to you know increase its prices from $13 to $750 because it feels like it it's not gonna shut down shut not shutting down is actually important so it's there was a study done a few years ago that shows that if you look through all of the supreme Supreme Court rulings and you look through the websites that the Supreme Court ruling site about 49 ",
        "11": "percent of them are just no longer accessible because the websites shut down so you know this is one of those sort of benefits of decentralization people don't have to think about but it's there so you know block chains what they basically give you is a you know through not relying on any one particular particular party using these kinds of protocols they give you a sense remediation so you know they give you a sort of generalized X without the X so you know if you like the idea if you like the idea of group or if you like the idea of you know just anyone being able to rent out their car well they what whether they wanted to be a full-time job or whether they wants to just do 30 minutes of it while they you know while they go home from work or just during their spare time or you know if you like the idea of people renting out spare space on Airbnb if you like you know whatever other sort of sharing economy applications but you don't like the idea of a company sitting there in the middle and it's taking a huge huge chunk of the profits and so they keep ",
        "12": "sort of having a large degree of control over the whole process then you could create sort of decentralized systems that act as alternatives so now of course when people you know talk about blog chains as systems for creating these kind of trusted applications you often ends up running into one problem which is when you start talking to people who are not ideological anarchists then guess what they trust Microsoft they trust Google they trust their government so you know blog chains are not in the near term going to be competing with these people now of course that doesn't mean that they don't have value so one very simple situation a simple example let's say you're an American you probably trust the American government you prowl on the other hand well okay maybe okay that's a bad one suppose you're okay suppose that you are an Australian you problem ",
        "13": "you trust the Australian government but you know baby but but let's you don't trust the Chinese government meanwhile if you're in China chances are you might not trust any of these other governments now you know what if you're trying to make some kind of some kind of business and that business involves people in China people in the US people in Australia and a few other countries you know potentially if you know maybe a few in the middle we still add one in North Korea North Korea for fun so you know in those cases all of a sudden you start to realize that once you have this sort of web of international dependencies maybe it's actually harder than we think to come up with centralized parties for everyone to agree on so you know there are there are places where this stuff is useful just have to think just a bit harder in order to figure out what they are this is another way of looking at it so people now it's interesting actually that you know I when I mentioned the ",
        "14": "idea of trust in government I got a whole bunch of laughter but Google and Microsoft seems to be uncontroversial so you know as much as the Bader's outside criticize capitalism it's people whose actual reactions be slightly different in some cases but anyway so Microsoft and Google just to play it safe you know they seems to have gotten to being fairly trusted and basically the reason why that's the case is because they're extremely big and you know I spend billions of dollars getting to where they are and they know that if they screw up they're going to basically you know lose potentially billions of dollars of future a future revenue and customer value and so forth and so you know there's this really huge amount of sort of combined economic and social capital institutions like those now if I am some random you know 16 year old living in my mother's basement and I decide I wants to be an entrepreneur and I wants to create a financial system I don't have that you know people are ",
        "15": "going to say well okay it's just some random key and you know why is that he's just going to get bored the next week and I'm just gonna lose all my money so the problem is that this sort of centralized approach to getting trust it does so you know sometimes in Vietnam very often work but it does have its it's expensive it's not particularly accessible for the ordinary person to create an application which is trusted in this way so one of the potentially value propositions of decentralization is this idea that you can get the trust faster so you know theoretically it's always possible to get to get trusty institutional route but if that route is not available to you either because you're a 15 year old kid and his mother in this basement or because you're in an entrepreneur somewhere in Africa or you know because you're up because you're in some in some industry where you know whatever kinds of you know kinds of issues just make it harder for large institutions to emerge ",
        "16": "potentially some kind of hyper specialized industry then you know you have this alternative route you have this alternative approach which lets you create applications that are that are trustworthy without you know having to prove to everyone that you're trustworthy yourself and that's potentially powerful aside from that there's also some side benefits so standard blog chains provide platforms that are standardized they provide platforms that are automated so for example you know for bit if you look at banks banks are very interested in smart contracts and you know the room as a result some of them often an adoptee and being interested in block chains but the part that a lot of these institutions are more interested in is own it's quite often the automation more so than the decentralization and yet you know block chains are an automated platform just you know buy a buy their coffee to computational nature and so you know there's lots of different groups and I just end up appreciating that so global ",
        "17": "you can use a watching from any country you can send money from Kyrgyzstan to Guatemala using Bitcoin and it cost you exactly as much as sending money to your neighbor which is great and you know surprisingly enough cheap so even though it seems as though blog chains just are this at least right now are this core endlessly and efficient approach that relies on these you know these systems are like thousands and tens of thousands of computers verified every transaction and mining and so forth even still singing a transcending a transaction costs you 3 cents and sending money through PayPal cost you any or anywhere from 5 cents - Tonino thousands of dollars depending on how big the transaction is and you know even though that fact is more a result of market failure than it is a result of any kind of technological limitations it's still a fact and people are interested in blockchains as as a way of making things cheaper to get around those issues here's an interesting one ",
        "18": "inter application interoperability that is even more reliable than the platform the applications run on so this is a kind of counterintuitive sort of in the same way that you know if any if anyone still remembers physics class and somehow managed to cover the concept of us sailing downwind faster than the wind it's kind of counterintuitive in that sense because if you have you know application a on one block in an application beyond the other blockchain or a sort on the same blockchain then even if that blockchain ends up you know having some kind of hiccup for some period of time whether it's you know because of some kind of software glitch whether it's because of someone attacking it or you know anything in that category even still you know from the point of view of within the blockchains universe and the application and application P can still perfectly talk to each other so you know that's just one of the kinds of guarantees that you could get from these kind of systems you know now what do people use them for ",
        "19": "three years ago this West basically had one item which is money now the loss looks like this you have generalized Identity Management so this is you know the idea that people have for 10 or 20 years been frustrated with this concept that you know you have to have some kind of you know 400 different accounts one account with every forum that you're on and memorize a whole bunch of different passwords either forget all of them or you know have all of them controlled by LastPass and then LastPass controls your online life or you know lately people have been creating for applications where if you forget your password you can reset it with your knee with your email accounts and Google controls your online life so you know people want kind of alternative where that gives users more control over sort of their role and you know online destiny reputation systems so if if you're an uber driver and someday you decide I don't like whatever is doing I want to switch to lift instead well guess what ",
        "20": "all your reputation basically goes back to zero and you know it's basically the same thing for any kind of sort of peer-to-peer recon the economy application so can we create reputation systems that are independent from any one particular company that's that's running whatever whatever service that people are using at one particular time digital asset management ranging you know everywhere from currencies to financial securities to merchant rewards points to domain names you know whatever else securities trading trade foreign trade finance private private markets various kinds of quasi financial assets you know the list goes on and on and we're hearing about some new category of application every one or two months so you know this this is just another sign or l'espace has me quite a lot of progress I think in especially in the last few years so for many of these applications one sort of a guest controversial claim that you can make is that the side benefits are ",
        "21": "Standardization globalization are actually even more important than the trust component directly but even still the trust component is important because a lot of these other benefits are a natural consequence of it so quick experiments with everyone so suppose this is so this was a sort of thought experiments that's introduced by David Friedman which was based on another thing which is done by introduced by Thomas Schelling but basically suppose that you and another prisoner in another room are both given the list of numbers and you're basically told both of you separately pick a number if both of you pick the same number you go free otherwise you both die painful death so just to make this presentation more fun actually let's do this everyone close your eyes and I'm gonna run I'm gonna go through these numbers one by one and raise your hand for each one if that's the number you pick okay eyes closed 9:42 1182 1161 661 9 2007 167 1014 78 ",
        "22": "2035 181 573 okay so there's a few lots of people are died painful deaths tonight now as it turns out you know lots of people did put their hands up for a 942 and a thousand which is interesting now of course the question is why do why would people put their numbers up for or why would people put their hands up for those numbers and the answer basically is because they expect everyone else to and you know because in this procedure were contrived setting and as it turns out in many other places in real life if you pick the same the same thing that other people are getting you are picking you benefit now you know ",
        "23": "why a thousand and why not 1478 well you know neither numbers sort of intrinsically better than the other and there's no real advantage to picking one versus the other but it just so happens that within the context of our culture we use base 10 and so a thousand is sort of artificially made to be significant and just because everyone knows that and everyone knows that everyone knows that and everyone knows that everyone knows that you know and so on so the power of infinity a thousand seems like a good number to choose and 942 you know it seems like 942 was the first that's actually kind of unexpected uh-huh you know what David Friedman actually came up with the example he predicted that everyone would pick the number that's a power of 10 but I guess he's been slightly empirically disproven on that front so so the problem is a judge you know that this is a Justi sort of hypothetical scenario involving prisoners it also happens in the real world so this is a somewhat famous a xkcd comic about standardization you notice there are ",
        "24": "fourteen competing standards that's ridiculous we should come up with a universal standard that covers everything okay now we have 15 standards so coordination is important you know standardization is one yet is one aspect of coordination so what could you coordinate on one court kind of coordination is different individuals companies and governments using the same platform another kind of coordination is different applications using the same platform another kind of coordination and something which doesn't seem what doesn't really seem like coordination if you haven't thought about it too hard but actually is is different employees inside of a sort of highly bureaucratic organization that sort of that's potentially potentially resistant to change all making a political push at the same time to finally get rid of their 50 year old systems written in COBOL and replace them with something more modern so that's coordination to you know if one guy doesn't he's going to get laughed out of the room if all the developers do it then it might actually happen so blockchains ",
        "25": "seem to have these properties that naturally you know make them good points for coordination so part I think of the reason why people are in you know people are interested all of a sudden in you know both block chains for identity block chains for were you know improving certificate authority as block chains for robbed of trust and so forth is that you know everyone has known for 10 to 20 years that SS you know that the sort of security infrastructure around SSL is terrible and it sort of combines the worst aspects of centralization and decentralization basically now we have lots of security authorities if you hack any of them than large parts of the internet are screwed but you know people have known for a long time that these you know problems around identity management are serious problems but you know there hasn't been sort of enough momentum to fix them all of a sudden now you have this extra ingredients or these kind of neutral platform small called blog chains and ",
        "26": "they have somehow managed to sort of successfully stir up the energy I think in a lot of communities and actually looking at all these problems and kind of solving them at the same time and basically you know sort of creating a more secure internet for tomorrow so you know why have blockchains achieve this you know why not credit default swaps or you know the self-driving cars or in or whatever other things people have invented in the last 10 years reliability so if you're going to build an application on top of something you needs to be really sure that it's going to survive that if the world becomes dependent on it it's not going to start charging monopoly rents percieves neutrality and you know basically you know into sort of a feeling of Independence of any single commercial political entity now note that none of these three are sort of our decentralization explicitly so here's another sort of an sort of counterintuitive point now on the left ",
        "27": "side you see a picture this is a picture from the Hong Kong scaling Bitcoin conference this was a panel on mining and the sort of this went around Twitter a lot because if you look at the panel on mine and the sort of headline that came with it is this pan that you know here on stage we have people representing 90% of the mining power of Bitcoin now the nine people on the right are the Bank of England monetary policy committee so if you look at these two pictures which of East he was more decentralized so you know perhaps you know perhaps it's some sense of perceived mutuality that actually matters or perhaps you could argue that the miners actually are more decentralized and you know you could have sort of ease along debates and arguments about you know what sort of what the clients of the decentralization and what the concept of control actually means so you know over here you have nine people from the exact same culture ",
