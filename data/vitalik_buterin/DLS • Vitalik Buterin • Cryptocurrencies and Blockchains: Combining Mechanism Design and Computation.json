        "0": "[Applause] [Music] [Applause] okay so today I'll be talking about just giving an introduction and I'd have overview as to what cryptocurrencies are what block chains are is what kinds of things you can do on block chains other than cryptocurrencies and also more generally kind of why I find them interesting and both an academic and a and the social sense so first of all I know what's in a Bois chain right so and I'm sure a lot of people have seen kind of pretty diagrams like this one before a block chain is a chain of looks that was so hard for me to figure out uh-huh so basically the idea is that it's this data structure that keeps track of a history of just things of some kinds that people wants to and have collectively keep track of right so the amount of originally of motivating use ",
        "1": "case for block chains was Bitcoin thus a peer-to-peer digital currency that was launched at the beginning of 2009 and the problem that like people were trying to solve with launching a peer-to-peer digital currency was this thing called double spending problem right so with there is this the kind of cypher punk movement that so we'll keep kept on wanting to kind of create decentralized than kind of central authority independence versions of things and for something like file-sharing more you can do it people can kind of send files to each other over the internet for encrypted messaging you can do it people can kind of send messages to each other over the Internet turns out currency is kind of harder and the reason why is this such a challenge called the double spending problem right so the double spending problem basically says suppose I have a digital record kind of speaking very abstractly that says I have 100 coins and suppose I send ",
        "2": "those 100 coins to one to one person and I create whatever kind of set of messages I need to create to authorize that transfer now suppose I create the exact same set of messages I'll accept authorizing a transfer to another person so now one person has what looks like enough of a sufficient proof to get 100 coins and another person also has what looks like a sufficient proof to get 100 coins so I've turned 100 coins into 200 coins yay free money a communist utopia except so in reality we know we know that we just wait the hyperinflation so the problem basically is how do you create a currency where you can't just copy money as much as you want right because information is just so easy to copy how do you make a information based currency that you can't copy and the approach that Bitcoin ended up taking is basically that you have this decentralized network consisting of the ",
        "3": "source number of computers and for a transaction to be valid it doesn't just have to be a message sent for me to you it also has to be a broadcast on to the network and it has to be a kind of accepted by the network now who is the network well what computers are we talking about you know if I send the transaction to a and a transaction to be at the same time up to the network how does it decide whether it's a pick one or the other and Liam so there's actually two problems that are that are in here right so one of those problems is this problem of decentralized consensus and the other problem is this problem of how do we even kind of measure participation rights in a fully open network right like you could say Oh instead of having one server we're gonna have 10 servers and maybe seven of them have to agree and then we'll do some layer on the layers on top to make sure like seven of them actually end up ",
        "4": "agreeing on something and resolving out of sports between five and five but then you still have to choose more who are the ten servers and well what if there's no one who's willing to run those ten servers at the beginning what if people still don't trust those ten servers you know companies collude all the time you know there's normally have the LIBOR scandal you have like just lots of instances of collusion everywhere on how do you prevent it so the solution that Satoshi came up with says be SiC away that in you create the system we're just literally anyone can participate in the network ah but if anyone can participate in the network then what if I joined the network and I pretend create 1 billion fake virtual machines and then I pretends that these 1 billion fake virtual machines are legitimate computers on the network right and then I act like part of the network and I have this kind of big overwhelming control over the network and I just unilaterally decide what transactions the network Court agrees on so to prevent this the Bitcoin used ",
        "5": "proof of work right so proof of work basically means that for a in order to measure the extent of one nodes right to participate in the network you basically measure how much computing power they have and how do you measure how much computing power they have well you basically have require all of these nodes to be just constantly solving these mathematical puzzles 24/7 and basically how many solutions you can crank out kind of dictates what your level of participation is in the network and so if I stand each transaction to some one person and then I want to do what's called a double spending fraud and basically take the money back by say sending a turn in other transaction to myself then in order for me to be able to actually revert the Consensus I would needs to have more computing power than the rest of the network put together you know so this is kind of the core ",
        "6": "underpinning of this big Bitcoin system so basically each one of these blocks in order for it to be considered a valid block it has to have in one of these and of mathematical puzzle solutions attached to it and a blog can get some kind of points to a previous block and so we have this chain of blocks it just keeps on growing over time and you might ask well what if there's disagreements what if there's two my people that build two blocks on top of the see the same block well eventually someone's going to build on top of one of them and if there's a conflict the chain that's the longest chain wins so this is one of the this is kind of very early idea and you know since then it's led to a hundred billion dollar cryptocurrency so what kind of property is do we want like why do we just wants to do all of these things right so first of all people wanted to have this property of full decentralization so no dependence on specific central authorities and but ",
        "7": "basically the reason why I want to avoid central authority is as well before Bitcoin you had centralized digital cash you had like PayPal and PayPal well what did they do they started charging high fees they started charging even higher fees if the payment was international they started blocking people's accounts if they didn't like them in many cases even if they were perfectly legal they started doing a bunch of things that lots of people didn't like and so you know the goal was that instead of trying to kind of may spin off a competitor to PayPal and hoping that the people running it are nice next time well you make a system that doesn't require one particular group of people to be nice and instead you tried to and maximally rely on economic incentives fully open so you want a system where anyone can participate as a transaction sender as a transaction receiver as a miner so I guess a participates in this consensus so in any of these roles anyone can ",
        "8": "participate on equal terms no privileged parties censorship resistance so it's extremely difficult to stop transactions from getting included into the chain and it's expected to just keep running as long as there exists at least someone who is running these mathematical puzzles and cranking out new Bitcoin blocks so this is an interesting technology because it integrates multiple categories of technologies and ideas so one of them is just base it's basically distributed consensus now you can kind of argue that Bitcoin proof-of-work is a kind of consensus algorithm in the kind of formal definition of the term if you kind of add a couple of layers on top of it and people have sort of written papers about it fundamentally it just means getting different nodes in the network so to agree on things even if there's network latency even if some of the nodes are ",
        "9": "actively trying to break the protocol now but then distributed consensus by itself is something that we've had in different forms since the 1980s so the next so that's not the only thing right so the next thing is that we have proof of work as economic civil resistance so this is this idea that you use measuring computers ability to solve these mathematical puzzles as a way of distinguishing kind of quote real participants from like me trying to make a billion virtual the fake virtual machines and then there's also this self-reinforcing economic incentive property right so bitcoin kind of uses game theory at its core in many ways and the way that it does this is that if you make a block that makes it into the chain then you have a you get a block reward of 12 and a half bitcoins and if you create a block that it's not part of the chain then you do not get a reward and you've wasted a lot of money solving these mathematical puzzles so basically ",
        "10": "the idea is that if you expect most of the other participants in the network to be honest then it's your incentive to and have build on top of the chain so that you actually get these rewards and why is everyone else going to be honest because they're also building on top of the chain because they want to seek these rewards so it's this really nice kind of recursive structure where everyone's incentive system is to be honest as long as most of the others participate honestly and in order for the Bitcoin the currency to have value it has to sit on top of a protocol that's secure and why is there incentive to help make the protocol secure because the currency has value so it's this kind of circular sort of chain of a set of things that all kind of feed into each other in this wonderful positive feedback loop and it's successfully kept the thing running for ten years so what kinds of problems has it solved right so first of all one of its major goals is to just be decentralized and distributed ",
        "11": "consensus as a field so this idea that you have what five or ten computers and let's get them to send messages to each other so that they all agree on something even if some of the participants maybe up to a third of them are trying to actively subvert the network this is something that people have written papers about since the 1980s the first one is from Leslie Lamport in 1982 the the work has since then been kind of expanded into a fully fledged consensus algorithms things like pbft now you might ask well why do you need like proof of work why not use these algorithms and it's because while these algorithms all have this implicit model that you know that there exists these specific ten computers right and in this sort of fully open informational setting there does not exist you know even a list of ten computers that we all trust and so instead well we have to use proof of work so important goal really be decentralized so you have this kind ",
        "12": "of the main challenges of this one of them is what I call this kind of weight assignment problem which is basically says given some set of actors how do we assign them weights so how do we say I have like 1% of the network do you have 0.5% of the network he has 0.5% of the network she has 0.7% and cryptographic protocols that don't have access to kind of roots of trust legal identity whatever so anyone can create as many accounts as they want and so you can solve this problem basically only with economics right so basically in proof of work the quantity of these kind of expensive mathematical puzzle solutions that you come up with basically determines your level of participation in the system and in a proof of stake which is this kind of newer and potentially more efficient paradigm the number of coins you have inside of the system is this economically limiting resource that determines your kind of level of participation in the network ",
        "13": "consensus and then there's also the incentive problem how do we encourage people to participate instead of not participating and participate honestly instead of participating in some malicious way so proof-of-work uses economic tools to solve both of these challenges so this is Bitcoin right and by N's bitcoins run well you know it's run for ten years that's only broken one twice it's only almost broken like maybe what maybe once it's processed a bunch of transactions the price is up to about $4,000 yay but as the saying goes right cryptocurrency is only the first app so around maybe 2013 when people really started realizing that you know hey this Bitcoin thing works as blockchain thing is interesting wait this blockchain thing maybe this blockchain thing this kind of decentralized consensus mechanism is useful for more things than just Bitcoin hmm ",
        "14": "[Music] and so there started to be this kind of set of projects that we're trying to expands the capabilities of a blockchain to be lines just a cryptocurrency right there were well probably the for the second blockchain in existence I'm not sure but I believe was named coin which was trying to use a Bitcoin blockchain to make a decentralized the DNS system then there were projects that we're trying to let people issue other assets and use the blockchain to keep track of transfers of other assets there's one called colored coins there were protocols enabling more and more features than one of one of the big ones was master coin people were starting these kind of Swiss Army knife block chains that would support ten different transaction types for ten different applications and XT was a big one at the time and so there was a lot of interest in this more and more kind of capability ",
        "15": "and the main idea behind etherium is to basically provide all the capability by taking the path of generality right so instead of supporting a specific list of applications in theory improving language and you can write the kind of business logic of any application you wants to write in this programming language and the process of executing transactions that get included in the blockchain also runs this computer code and so it helps run your application so one of the things that people talk about block chains being useful for is this notion of a smart contract and so Nick Szabo and of the earliest originator of the term had this wonderful analogy for a smart contract where he said there were kind of similar to vending machines and if you think about a vending machine right it's basically kind of a set of rules that is enforced by a given security by physical Hardware right so ",
        "16": "the rules basically say you put two hours in water comes out you don't put two dollars in water does not come out simple right now the purpose of the vending machine is to be this kind of automated physical device that enforces the rules and enforces them like up to some level of security right if you try really hard you can whack the virtual machine with a hammer and you can do a 51% attack on its orientation and you can kind of orient it flat and then grab as much water as you want until until the police come running but that's a different security model but the point of basically vending machines do have realistically a kind of enough security for their tasks and they automate this task and the odd and they reduce the need for like basically trusting humans relying on human intermediaries so a block a smart contract on a blockchain kind of is a digital equivalent of this right it's a computer program that directly controls ",
        "17": "ownership of digital assets and has the right to distribute them according to some pre specified set of rules so one simple example of this is two out of three escrow so the idea basically is what's suppose that you have a system where I have a phone and I want to sell you this phone for let's say one Bitcoin because you want to pay four thousand dollars for a phone for some reason actually not one not one Bitcoin and so this is on a theory I'm one ether so now it's cheap the so what here's what you do right so you first of all you can initialize the contract and when we initialize the contract we have me the buyer we are me the seller we have you the buyer and will appoint some third party to be the arbitrator right so this is kind of like eBay arbitration except the improvement ",
        "18": "that we're going to go after is that we don't trust any one of these three parties completely we only like the only way in which this system can break is if two out of three parties both kind of act incorrectly or maliciously in some way so step one we call the init function and we sum you called the init function and so the the buyer parameter of this program so these are persistent variables get set to but basically whoever sent the transaction the seller parameter gets sent to be the some arguments of the call of the smart contract so in this case it would be me and the arbitrated arbitrator would be set to just some other third party right so I don't know let's say like this water bottles the arbitrator so the there's so what's gonna happen is when you start the process of buying the phone you're gonna call init and then you're gonna send one ether into the ",
        "19": "smart contract now after that there's - there's a few possible things that can happen right so the normal workflow is I take the phone I ship it over to you you receive it and you are happy and then it's to express your sheer joy and happiness of receive at successfully receiving the products you call the finalize function and the finalize function says oh if who the person calling the function is the buyer then you basically sends the money inside of the smart contract the to the seller which is me so I get the money the contract doesn't have money anymore you can throw it away and you're done yay now let's look at some less happy paths right so that's the happy path so one less happy path is I decide just I'm gonna change my mind I'll I love this phone it's a great phone and I'm not gonna sell it to you for one eighth and so I am going to call the reef function and refund says if the seller if the message sender is the seller then send the money back to the buyer and so ",
        "20": "just give you your money back now let's suppose I don't give you my phone and I also want your ether now what's gonna happen well clearly you are not going to call finalized because you didn't get your phone I'm not gonna call refunds because I'm a greedy jerk and you can't not you know I can't call finalized and you can't call refunds because the code doesn't let you and so instead we have to rely on the arbiter right and so both of these functions can be called by the arbiter so the arbiter comes in he's like hey where's the phone man and you know if I if I still have the phone then he's gonna call refund and if the buyer actually has the phone then the arbiters gonna call finalized now if the arbiter is malicious then notice that the only power the arbiter has the arbiter can't just control the money themselves the arbiter can only send it back to the buyer or send it to ",
        "21": "the seller so if the arbiter is dishonest but the buyer or the seller are honest then the buyer can just see if the buyer gets the money the buyer can just volunteer always send in to the seller if the seller gets the money and it's honest and what's the refund the seller can just send it to the buyer so in any of these cases like you need two out of three parties to both mean both be malicious in order for this protocol to not work right so this is just sort of one example of how you can use smart contracts to get security guarantees that would not be possible without those smart contracts so there's more complex examples that you can do with them so this is a kind of somewhat more complicated involved application this is something called yuna swap and the way that yuna swap works is that say kind of on blockchain decentralized exchange so it's this smart contract where the smart contract holds two different kinds of assets one of them might be Eve and another might be some other cryptocurrencies so in this case we call ",
        "22": "them a tokens and B tokens and the way that the exchange works is it basically it whole some quantity of tokes a token some quantity of V tokens and the smart contract code maintains this hard invariance that the quantity of a that the exchange Hall contract holds multiplied by the quantity of via the exchange holds equals some constant K and this like hyper hyperbola is the XY equals K curve so let's say I have a tokens and I want to convert them into B tokens what do I do well base kind of mathematically speak and you can think of it as well I just specify a different point on the XY equals K curve that I want the contract to be right so before the college I had this much and this much B I want the contract to have more a and less B and so I'm gonna cover the difference in a and the B and the X the B tokens that the exchange losses go to me right and so I'm giving it a and I'm getting B and in the process I'm also ",
        "23": "kind of bumping up the price right so you can look at the and if the implicit derivative of the curve as basically just being the price of a versus B R and as more people buy a the price go the price goes up and it gets more expensive as more people buy be the price V goes up and B becomes more expensive so this so this thing is actually running right now and it's in terms of like the amount of of money locked in a theorem applications it's actually the third largest and on the blockchain so it has about seven million dollars of reserves that are locked inside of it and people just use this as an exchange for charge for trading assets and it seems to be working great so the you know what this is just one example of how you know smart contracts can be used to just design a whole bunch of really clever and interesting kinds of mechanisms so why are people interested right so ",
        "24": "there's two kinds of reasons that I think block chains are interesting so one of them are kind of academic reasons so blog chains are this very kind of pure playground for implementing applications that run on basically economic incentives experimenting and seeing the results of the experiments right you can just take something like write the code for something like you know swab test and deploy it and people can just start using it and you know basically it just runs as pure code and that's it there's also a community that has an existing interest in market mechanisms auctions applications just doing all sorts of cool things with smart contracts cryptocurrency is also just non-financial applications of walk chains like just using them to store data using them to store information about whether or not some particular key is still valid for some particular accounts and various things like that and generally it's just very easy to ",
        "25": "test and deploy so there aside from these kind of academic reasons some there and you know the academic reasons have kind of motivated a lot of people there is like a lot of prediction market enthusiasts are just go into the walk chain space because you can use wall chains to build prediction markets there's just people like market design enthusiasts to go into block chains because you can just build things like you in a swap and you can build things like combinatorial auctions on them and it's inch and it's cool and you can do it but there's also these social reasons it's right so basically block chains let us build this kind of entire class of applications that are not like anything that existed before right so something like even just Yunus wall for example is just not something that you can build on top of BitTorrent it's not something that you can build on top of you know like off-the-record messaging it's not something that you could build on top of ",
        "26": "like secure scuttlebutt or like any of these other protocols it just it requires global shared state and globally shared state is a strictly more powerful primitive but on the other hand there are there are things that you pay in or to get it right there like you have it's more expensive you have to get this global consensus you have higher latency so there is this entire class of applications that not not nearly all applications there's lots of things you can do without dois chains but there is this entire new class of things that you just can do if you have the decentralized global shared state and of digital institutions with no central coordinator that are not kind of focused in any single jurisdiction so there one of them kind of buzzwords that a lot of people were excited about is this idea of decentralized autonomous organizations or daos and people are interested in this concept of you know hey can we use da OS as kind of a better way for people to organize possibly as a replacement for ",
        "27": "companies and things like that smart contracts as a kind of special purpose cool legal systems that has very low enforcement costs in some cases so in those cases where you can just very easily measure whether or not some particular event happened you can just automatically do things based on those events then smart contracts are just this easy and kind of low trust way to implement many kinds of things right so instead what there's applications that are kind of very purely smart contract friendly so for example if I wants to give someone a bounty for factoring some RSA key and then I can just write that as rules as a smart contract and people can just freely go ahead and not try to claim the bounty if now you can go a bit further and you can say well what about applications that depend on data in the real world well in that case you one of the things that you can do is you you do ",
        "28": "need to have data feed providers and basically take data from the outside world and sort of push it into the blockchain or at least digitally sign it so you can verify it on the blockchain but you don't need to trust a single one right so you can have a smart contract that says we're going to take these nine data feed providers and we're going to take the median of them and so the contract is going to give in okay results as along as at least five of them are honest and you know still think this is something then people are starting to do it right so for example maker which is a project that uses smart contracts to create a price stabilized cryptocurrency on top of the etherium blockchain it actually has 14 price P is that it takes the median of in order to then have calculate the if the dollar exchange rate that it then uses to kind of target the part of the price of the die which is its price table cryptocurrency so also in smart contracts for just very ",
        "29": "very small things like insurance agreements certain kinds of financial agreements just lots of small things in those particular cases where they're relatively easy to measure you can use smart contracts for them more kind of open free and inclusive alternatives to a centralized applications and platform monopolies so this is a very big one so basically the idea here is that if you have a many different small companies in some industry and they want to and have interoperate more than sometimes messaging isn't in just and having common messaging standards is enough for that but sometimes interoperability also requires sharing state and if you want to share state then you need to have like some kind of platform that lets you have this kind of gold buoys shared a state that you can remember and so you can have applications we are sort of many smaller providers in the same industry all and have build on top of the same platform and we get a lot of ",
        "30": "the same kind of network effect benefits that they would get if they were one company without the risks of having a big super-powerful monopoly and like this is a page that I'm people in the gaming industry in some cases are trying to do and there's people that are trying to do this for different kinds of financial technology is and like many other kinds of things right so just in general more for many kinds of applications that are currently and of centralized monopolies you can sometimes use blockchains to create an alternative where like even if there are points of centralization there's kind of more of them and individual users can more easily kind of choo-choos and move between them in finally a community that's excited about just using technology for a positive social transformation so applications might talk augur there's the prediction market maker this kind of decentralized a price ",
        "31": "table cryptocurrency this is I believe hurricane guard and then this is you can actually play gomoku on the Bloch for for ether on the blockchain and this is actually not even on the blockchain this is actually using a scale a scalability technology called state channels so it's like technologically under the hood insanely cool and but you can do what in plans you can play gomoku and yeah it's fine [Music] non-financial applications are also important so Vlad chains can be used as kind of quote proof of in existence so cryptography can prove often enough that things happens but block chains can prove that things did not happen that some action of a certain type has not yet been taken because you can just scan the blockchain and you can verify that wait there actually is no record of a particular type that has happened yet and this is useful for example for decentralized identity management so if you have an identity that identity has ",
        "32": "some cryptographic keys that you use to sign messages and you wants to just store the information that you revoke a key and that key is not valid anymore then you can do that and you can have a kind of smart contract on a blockchain whose sole purpose is to just store the the variable which public key currently has the right to represent me and that key can change over time you can have rules for how that key can change and you can have rules for how to change those rules that you can implement all of that logic in there at the station's about individuals and organizations so things that came things that might need to be vocht so university degree is maybe citizenship maybe certain kind just various kinds of records various kinds of registry is just ultra high value data store so very small pieces of information possibly even just things like key is that you wants to be really really sure will be publicly accessible in ten years so there are cases where there are many kind certain kinds of ",
        "33": "protocols that actually do kind of depend on just generating information in the process where you do just want the information to be as publicly accessible and available after after some really long time in the future made so proof of process integrity so it for example if you have a mechanism like an auction for example then you can use this to verify that someone got a chance to participate in some mechanism and you can verify that people did not get unfairly censored because participating on on in the mechanism would have just required publishing transactions to the blockchain and the result of the mechanism can be provably kind of calculated as a computation of all the messages that were published to the blockchain so preventing kind of fraud via censorship so prevents and censorship like a lot of people think of the word as kind of most a lot of the time as meaning like be preventing ",
        "34": "people from talking about stuff and like resisting that kind of censorship is definitely valuable but then there's also this much broader category of censorship like for example censoring people's orders in mark in like markets and like exchange order books could be a way to cheat them or front run them and like basically extract money or extra fees from them so there's plenty of cases where you just have mechanisms or different kinds we are you wants to be able to have this strong guarantee that people got a fair chance to participate that that you cannot walk and that's an example of things that block chains can do so takeaways based mainly in first of all block chains are not just about cryptocurrency right so can use ball chains to do things like smart contracts you can build many different kinds of applications on top of them and this isn't just a radical ",
        "35": "right so here's this really wonderful tutorial from adapt University there's also kind of online web compilers for some of the programming languages that you would use to write smart contracts and aetherium and you can just go ahead and try to just build a simple blockchain based application that does something see and deploy it try using it see how it works and that's just one good way of sort of learning your way around the platform right so if you're interested then you know go build go build something and enjoy and you know look otherwise there's also plenty of other materials on the on the Internet to learn about a lot of this stuff and you know there's a lot of these kind of technical topics about how do these platforms actually work how did some of these applications work and but generally you can just kind of look for it and you'll probably find it so I mean thank you and and if people have questions I'm happy to answer them too ",
        "36": "[Applause] so the question was if I had to redesign a theory I'm from scratch what would I do differently so interestingly enough we kind of are redesigning aetherium from scratch so there's this some efforts I call it a theory I'm 2.0 which basically designs the sub walk chain based on proof of stake as for more efficient consensus charting for more scalability changes the virtual machine from the current EVM to web assembly makes a lot of the data structure is kind of much more efficient and less sort of awkward it replaces like hex three patrícia trees with binary trees you know and a bunch of other end of technical stuff that really increases efficiency so that effort exists and the first kind maybe two-thirds of it are actually very close to being fully specified so in that and it's sort of well on the way to being implemented so I'd encourage people to kind of check ",
        "37": "out the earth 2.0 effort as well so probably the main kind of tea some just random examples of things that we've learned from aetherium one that we've been incorporating into a Meath two so first of all there's just our research on proof of state consensus that was totally not mature at the time that we did a theory in 1.0 but that is quite mature and at the time at the time that we're doing a theory i'm 2.0 right now also our research around scalability through a sharding also a lot we've made a lot of kind of subtle decisions that made the protocol unnecessarily complicated so one example of this is that we have the state of the system so like account balances code storage blah blah blah is all stored in this kind of heck sorry Patricia Merkel tree structure with that's formatted in this complicated way and it takes about 200 lines of code so even more maybe like ",
