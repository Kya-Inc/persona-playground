        "0": "[Music] well uh this is amazing don't you think yes yeah [Music] [Applause] all right well we're here with vitalik and i think there's a bunch of questions that i have i think uh italic probably have uh some as well that we want to discuss i think the merge has been something that people been you know as you said working forward for seven years right and so this is a huge event for for the whole ecosystem and uh yeah let's let's dive in into some interesting questions at least from my side i'm really curious how you see the kind of the evolution between the the proof of stake right that i think a lot of people are waiting for a lot of people want to transition and the proof ",
        "1": "of work that you know has been there has you know probably hundreds of millions of dollars of hardware investment and kind of how do you see that evolution happening from perspective of you know miners and that ecosystem um [Music] i guess uh i mean from from the perspective of like the gen the the general ecosystem like them i think the the merge is uh like it's obviously more important than an average hard fork but like structurally in terms of what people have to do it's uh i think it's important to remember that it's not too different from a hard fork right because like you have um you know your account and your contract and your application and the merge happens and what happens during the merge is basically like the proof of in saying that the proof of work chain like stops is a bit of an over simplification because what actually ",
        "2": "happens is that the proof of work gets taken out the proof of work chain keeps existing it just like lives inside of the proof of stake chain after that right so from the point of view of like users and applications like if you're very little changes you know some like blocks start coming a little bit faster and more regularly blocks get reverted much less frequently uh but otherwise like it's just a yet a transition like many other transitions the big question of course that makes us different from like most other hard forks is that it does like basically tell miners you don't have a job anymore and that i mean of course this is something that's not going to surprise miners at all right because we've been talking about proof of stake pretty much uh since the beginning and um i think uh a lot of um like the ethereum proof of work chain has even been uh running longer than a lot of miners have even been hoping uh but you know at the same time obviously there is uh you know they still have hardware and um you know they're so they would obviously love to see their ",
        "3": "hardware continuing to be used for longer um and so i guess you know like what could they do like what one option is of course to try to like disrupt the merge somehow but that seems unrealistic at this point the other option is to try to kind of make some coordinated effort to support like some proof of work chain uh so that it could have more value more value when they could continue to mine it um and you know the natural choices that you have if you're if you're an ether miner is either ethereum classic or make a new one and um you know we've been seeing a couple of uh potential efforts to make a new one but like it's you know to me like it's not clear what value that chain would have to users right because like first like with ethereum quad like for me like with ethereum classic there's at least like a queer ideological pitch that you know oh you know you believe really strongly in the immutability vision and in kind of being even slower than um and more conservative in development than ethereum is and all of ",
        "4": "those things and those are things that users can value but here that it's like okay you know you're on a proof of work chain and otherwise like it's not clear what happens and like how is this thing better than ethereum classic so i mean you know we'll i guess you know we'll see if like that effort actually takes off and if it does whether they'll actually be able to make that case but we'll see well i think uh a few folks i know would expect that kind of people would just push the difficulty bomb and leave the east one pretty much running as it is and the value there interestingly is in the fork itself because at the moment of the merge you will have then two networks right which have kind of a mirrored copy of the of the state and the kind of question there is then you have exchanges you have oracle providers you have stable coin providers ",
        "5": "that kind of are deciding in a way right which one they respect because like at that point you'll have you know whatever 100 billion of usdt on one chain and 100 billion of usd on the other chain kind of cryptographically and so they need to stop respecting one of them which actually creates an interesting questions for the like a number of different angles like right legally you know and uh yeah no definitely i think uh they're like i have you know i haven't seen any like indication that any of the i mean that any of the major providers are going to like do anything other than consider the yeah like the the post-emerge ethereum to be ethereum but i think uh i mean in the further future that definitely becomes more of a concern like basically the fact that um you know usdc's decision of kind of which chain to consider ethereum is a yeah ",
        "6": "like it could become a significant decider in future contentious hard forks um yeah i mean well i guess the like one question to ask there is like in what future circumstances might they do that and you know in the future going forward like five or ten years from now i mean obviously yeah you know there there's definite there is a chance that you know there will be more contentious hard forks in the future i mean there's even a chance that bitcoin will have a contentious hard forks in the future um and the yeah and at that point like you know maybe the ethereum foundation will be weaker maybe the uh youth two client teams will have more power maybe like uh someone like coinbase would have both run a stablecoin and have bought up one of the client teams by then like no like lots of those kinds of things could happen uh so yeah i mean i don't know what will happen i mean there is the question of like if that happened if that happens is that good or bad and if it like if it's if it's bad then like ",
        "7": "how could you conceivably stop it and like the best answer i can come up with is to just like encourage the adoption of more kinds of stable coins i guess and like basically yeah you know like people could usd use usdc but then you know you could use die and like at this point i mean like dai has taken this kind of very decisive route of saying you know we're not going to be purely crypto economic we're going to be a rapper for a whole bunch of real world assets but like dai could easily be a rapper for um you know instead of just the usdc of like 10 different kinds of u.s dollar-backed stable coins and my impression is that's what they want to do in the long term anyway but no we'll see yeah well i i saw them expanding in the real world which yeah is probably a way to grow supply right faster yeah i mean i like to me it's uh like it's an okay thing to do like i yeah i mean i want there to exist purely crypto economic stable coins which is why i've been a bit a big fan of rye recently but like the yeah the real world asset niche yeah i like i ",
        "8": "do think it's a totally okay nation someone needs to take it like i just want to you know die to move faster and kind of adding collateral that's not just usdc oh i hope they do so i guess like shifting gears from perspective of you know let's say other layer ones and like and ethereum there's i mean like i mentioned this there's a meme of ethereum killers which i really hate because it's it's constantly coming up from especially media just uh but like i mean to be clear we're not in a nobody's in the killing business here we're all in the building business and so like the whole point here is to you know build like different approaches so i'm curious from your perspective um how do you see kind of other layer ones right especially i mean given you mentioned like you wanna probably stabilize layer one right ",
        "9": "and allow more experimentation in layer two how do you see other layer ones taking potentially different approach right yeah i mean i think like first of all like there are some ones somewhere ones that actually are like at least attempted ethereum killers right like um you know last year you did have uh duke one say that like very infamous phrase by my hands die will die and then of course he ended up dying first but that's uh so and then you know there are like there are also like actually layer ones that kind of say the kind of you know very friendly we're a sister chain in private in public thing um but then um you know in private they raise hundred million dollar vc rounds off of uh mino hey guys ethereum is crap and replace them so like that does exist but i think there's also plenty of other projects that like actually rvr friendly actually do wants to co-exist and um actually um and i think there is a lot of uh a lot of room for that to happen um like i think you know there's obviously different trade-offs and design space ",
        "10": "that can be made right like you know you can choose that you know are you going to be a more decentralized chain or you're going to be a fast chain are you going to focus on like trying to support every application or you're going to focus on being really good for a particular kind of applications uh so like one random example might be like you know gaming right so in gaming you really care about latency right and it's like you really care about wayne state it's you know it's not even about like you can't even go and say like you know okay we'll be fine if we can do it in one in like one second because that's what tendermint does it's like no you need like a hundred and two hundred milliseconds and uh you know like i remember playing world of warcraft to 20 years ago if latency goes above 600 milliseconds like that would show you a red bar like 600 milliseconds is terrible and you know here we are with a block chains where even the fast chains advertise themselves as two seconds right so like if you want to make a like a real-time gaming chain then you know you have to go really hard in the uh pushing ",
        "11": "latency down direction but like that is going to make you worse in other ways right so like one very specific example is um if you want to be very low latency and like also be reasonably decentralized at the same time you might have to like share geographically you might have to say you know this is the america shard this is the uh europe shard this is the east asia shard and you know here's one for africa and here's one for the middle east and here's one for hawaii right like you know you might actually have to do something like that but that's not something that say a global payment network would uh want right so that would and then another example might be like you know what programming languages you want to support like do you um do you want to you can you can make different trade-offs at a uh even at a community level so i do think that there are lots of different approaches also in even like i thought you talked about some of these and the in the presentation and the whole kind of modularity versus like ",
        "12": "integrated way or one thing i think there's a lot of strategies that you can talk about uh and or and that you can try to do and so i'm happy that there we have this kind of very diverse cellular one ecosystem that can uh try all of them out yeah i think from my perspective i mean it's always been on on one side like we you know we've obviously learned a lot and kind of started from ethereum in many ways uh and to extend like we have we have definitely used the point that like you know we we will deliver something better than ethereum of on this on this set of criterias right right uh at the same time the i think the goal always being like how do we build something that everybody can use and and kind of how do we integrate more and i think like remote accounts and you know bridging etc is part of that story as well i think for me the question is right now we're in this kind of cambrian explosion ",
        "13": "phase the everybody's experimenting we have a lot of you know ideas we have a lot of things that will fail sadly but um at the same time it's you know some of these things will stabilize like you know we cannot have kind of continuously changing how you know like consensus is going to be done how uh you know runtime is going to be done over next i mean maybe we can over next you know 100 years but like my expectation is there will be some stabilization do you think at that point there will be more merges uh yeah no the chain merge thing has always uh fascinated me right like the question of uh you know if there are projects that are pushing like either similar or even just like very compatible visions then like i remember even thinking about this years ago that like it might make sense for a couple of uh projects to try to um merge i think i even like i i even recommended the idea to a ",
        "14": "couple of projects on top of ethereum but i think it ended up not happening because the logistics are hard like you have to convince both communities to be willing to merge and then you have to figure out this kind of question of like oh you know if you do the merger at what point well like at what points that token price do you take and it just gets into this sort of like really deep minefield like and to be clear like i yeah you know i really hope that like um we can eventually actually look put in the effort and figure out how to make more just happen because i do think that they can be really valuable for a lot of different communities but it's yeah yes it's a it it's a hard problem and it is something that i think would be really worthwhile to see eventually yeah i think it's a combination of like technical and operational complexity and then tr like somewhat tribalism of the ecosystems where ",
        "15": "in some way like to do emerge both need to give and so well i think it yeah i mean it depends on if it's like a horizontal or a vertical merge right so like one example is like horizontal would be if say yeah scroll and polygon decide to merge um and vertical would be if um let's say yeah like gnosis and status decide to merge right like two different uh ecosystems that do different things and they're complementary um i mean i guess i guess they're both interesting i mean i've generally been thinking about merges more from that kind of vertical perspective yes we'll see what ends up happening first i mean i think horizontal makes sense because at some point everybody will arrive to some like some set of decisions right which right like we do at least my expectation is there will be less good set of you know decisions and number of ",
        "16": "projects right now right and so that's true um one actual thing i wanted to ask you as i know it was watching the presentation and kind of near's approach of like not doing modularity as much and basically having this sort of more integrated chain is that it made me wonder like what are the actual differences between like say yeah like near's relationship with aurora or with uh forgot the name the enterprise one that starts with a c um and like if the ethereum's uh based lawyers relationship with like optimism and arbitration for example yeah that's a really good question so the way to think about it that near actually each contract is a rollup right right and we just bundle them kind of uh into the shards and just provide all the infrastructure engineers and data availability and challenges etc and so ",
        "17": "what something like aurora is it kind of from a perspective of developers just a smart contract right right they just like literally wrote some rust and just shipped it to the chain from perspective of kind of end end to end right it it is kind of its own roll-up that just you know right you just uses all of the infrastructure they don't need to have their own sequencers they don't need to have their own right what what was the name of that enterprise one calimera colomero right so like one example would be like if i'm a user of aurora then i would not be able to like see mostly send coins to someone in calamero right so that is in works okay yeah so so right now because aurora is evm what needs to happen is we need to extend the vm to support async right communication i see and so that's right now and like there's complexity around that because kind of how do you like that we've solved on near native runtime right we have promises with callbacks but you know we need to build kind of ",
        "18": "that in evm and i think alex shivchenko who is also here in korea they're working on that figuring out how to like make that also secure as well okay that's cool yeah okay so basically like the i guess in the near case the the near base is still like it's providing like some kind of like vm that all of these other things run in and so it's like doing execution and not just data yeah yeah yeah it does execution yeah through webassembly right yeah i guess like in ethereum circles like some people have suggested the idea that like eventually ethereum should have execution charts and that becomes like from a complexity perspective a much more viable thing to do especially once you can like zk snark things right and well the z case dark thing is powerful because you could you be basically you end up being able to support like in else a sort of more enshrined l2 with like pretty much any rules as long as you can expose them in like a ",
        "19": "verification key and a verification key is like what like five elliptic curve points uh so and it's like you know one polynomial equation to check no matter what the actual rules are which is uh kind of interesting so again like one of the things that i sometimes wonder is um you know like 10 to 20 years from now like you know how different are these things going to end up being yeah well so i do think zero knowledge will definitely play a huge role i think at least at the current stage and you know foreseeable stage the latency of zero knowledge will always be slower than just execution executing right so you still somewhere need to execute normally and get result to the user and so i think from my perspective what what we want from a zero knowledge is a proof that is lasting that everybody can verify cheaply right you know especially on the light clients and that like that's what i meant by compression it's like for me this is ",
        "20": "more about compression than about kind of a faster run time because just the simple runtime just running the code you still need to do that right well i mean you could take the pbs route where you kind of like specialize the role of uh kind of creating blocks and then everyone else like just verifies proofs right from the beginning yes that but that that's still latency right it's like right yeah that's true yeah yeah so i think that that's a trade-off like how do we if if we're trying to optimize for like what's the fastest latency we can achieve and then and and then kind of proofs coming in later i think that's like for me and this is kind of how we design even our consensus is always pipelining it's like do everything as fast as possible and then catch up with all the you know like approvals and verification data availability so i think like there's another topic which may be shifting completely gears from the from the merge is ai okay yeah it's fine i think ",
        "21": "uh i saw you i mean some of your tweets uh obviously i've been uh kind of thinking a lot about this the kind of kind current situation is that we have a very fast evolving private companies that are kind of building a very powerful capabilities right and i think open air has been you know showing some of the work they're doing um but not actually opening it up and we have obviously you know google we have you know a few other few other facilities that have kind of access to compute and talent and need at the same time you have lots of talent sitting on sidelines like in universities because they actually don't have access to the compute and data they need to do this so i think the question that i keep thinking about is how do we ",
        "22": "kind of leverage what we're building here right with web3 to actually make it community governed give the resources that you know these researchers and universities need to have access at the same time kind of the outcome of this be available to the kind of community as a whole yeah i know it's a good question i guess the way that that i think about the ai space and like ai safety problems in general is um like what are going to be the dominant factors that will make like the best ais uh better than you know either like media ais or the best ais of like one or two years before and like the possibilities are basically like one is better algorithms so you know better kinds of neural networks and you know convolutions and whatever you know fancy math the other is uh better just more compute and the third is more data and like there has been this kind ",
        "23": "of i think big kind of shift over the last five years where a lot of people just think that like if you just add more compute and more data that might be like enough to get all the way to like guys being smarter than humans and i'm not sure how much i believe this like i yeah on the one hand like you know i get their arguments but on the other hand i have this sort of strong intuitive sense that we that like there's categorical things that um you know gbt3 and zelda aren't doing um so i don't know um but you know if we are in the world where just like compute and uh well if we're in the world where compute is the bottleneck right then like the question to ask is like why should we even believe at all that sort of blockchain style decentralized things have any shot at all at being competitive and if it's compute then the answer is pretty simple which is that like decentralized economic crypto economic stuff is actually incredibly good at uh brute force computation because um you know we have mining and we just ",
        "24": "basically all we would have to do is like in create a new form of mining and would have like millions of computers around the world basically being this like big huge collective uh ai if it's data then you know you could imagine like some kind of like if we can invent some form of decentralized training that's like reasonably privacy preserving on the data and you know potentially even find ways to like compensate people for contributing their own data then like you could create something there um and then like obviously if like all the what actually matters is algorithms then like i do think that's hard to decentralize because eventually it is going to come down to just like needing you know one guy to eventually come up with the right idea and then it's a matter of like who's like whether or not that idea gets kept secret and who deploys it uh though so far the the ideas haven't been that secret yet which is um i guess a good sign uh so ",
        "25": "yeah and it to the extent that it's based on like computing data i can definitely see how you could create some kind of like big ai that's uh decentralized in some blockchain way um and i could definitely see the like the benefits of doing it that way right that basically you do have this thing which is uh like which actually ends up being controlled by some collective uh network where the control is done transparently instead of having it just be a thing that lives in inside of a data center somewhere i mean i think from what we've seen the and like for a context i worked on some of the models that are right now scaled up to be like at the basis of gpd3 and and others and like the reality is it's kind of the same pattern replicated and scaled up and even the data is not i would say data is not as bottleneck although like a smart data ",
        "26": "is better uh obviously yeah i think the the question that i keep wondering though is is governance of this because the reality is like let's say we build this kind of you know incentivized system that you know amasses millions of computers that are training you know this gigantic model and like we don't even need to like i actually don't like believe we're going to achieve like a full you know like general sentiential intelligence you know in like coming years but what we will achieve is actually building better instruments that are indeed better in many ways than humans can be right and like this is coming from for example google being a more knowledgeable you know like than any single person can be yeah right and so we can build systems that are like that already that are and that are now more maybe not creative but they're better synthesis better at finding information and ",
        "27": "they're better at kind of putting things together already with algorithms we have and so i think the for me then the question is like how do you govern the the system because as you know do you give access to everyone and then you know what are kind of bad things this can lead to do you give access to you know researchers that you know can modify and kind of extend it right well that's one part of the question and then the other part of the question is like what do you train it on right because like if you write a storytelling ai and you uh train it on like books that'll give a very different results from like if you treat it on 4chan and so then you know feel like if you're training on books like is it just books in english do you add books in chinese do you add books in korean like you know with what frequencies uh so there's like interesting governance questions i think in like what the trading data is too like especially since like from what we've seen of ais so far like they're definitely good at ",
        "28": "kind of just you know mimicking the sort of the general vibe of like you know the data that's been fed into them so yeah i guess so so that's aside from like when do we like when does the thing get released to whom like that's probably the other big lever uh so the and then the the question is like you know what kind of governance would actually get built like um you know like who would have the right to participate what would the mechanism be and all of those questions so i'm going to like what is your thought been on that so far i think we do need this is why like part of for near as well we're trying to figure out what is the more kind of still decentralized checks and balances system but we which has some kind of executive function which has some kind of strategy decision making at some point right that is accountable to the community is you know able like is can be ",
        "29": "vetoed and can be potentially uh you know fired but is kind of driving some strategy because i think at the end it's still people like we you know i i kind of one of those things that we've we do sometimes like with some of the folks uh i work with is we ban some words as a way to actually get clarity so at some point we bans your knowledge because it was too easy to say oh is this going to be solved with zero knowledge without actually getting clarity on what that means and so i think this is like right now it's it's worse banning word community because it's really easy to say oh community will do it or community government etc without actually explaining what that actually means right and i think like getting a clarity like who are the people behind what like what what is the drivers and how they're making decisions is really important in this case especially i think you want kind of different levels of participation right you want you know experts and ",
        "30": "kind of on one side who are able to come together and make decisions who can review potentially even the results of this model in different ways and you can have kind of a broader set of people who are you know participating in this because they're like economically aligned and then you have somebody who is you know knowledgeable and kind of full-time working on governing this and deciding like even when you mention some data questions and potentially like use case questions like where should this be applied like should it be trading on ftx or should it be you know writing wikipedia should it be you know because like you can actually apply the same model for for any of those use cases and like you at some point you need to make these decisions as well um so i think like that kind of model and we we're trying to like figure this out as kind of a pattern in general for daos yeah no yeah i mean i i definitely agree those are all hard questions like i think there's like there's no such thing as like the ",
        "31": "aggregate of a community's opinion it all depends on kind of what the mechanism is right it's like you know on the one hand like if you go ask people what they think of mark zuckerberg a lot of people will say they hate him but then if you if you look at people's kind of actions in the market they um you know use the platform in there and they contribute to him having 100 billion dollars so yeah and it's all about like you know what is the mechanism that you're using aggregate and you know like there are mechanisms that are better in mechanisms that are worse and like this question of like what's to build is uh i mean i'm i guess i'm i'm hoping that you know the crypto space can kind of help us quickly yeah go go through a lot of different designs and just kind of you know very quickly give all of us a better idea of like what works reasonably well and what and what breaks very quickly so yeah i think like for me so we built astra dao i think a bit year and a half ago like the first version and we that's that's bad for a lot of the kind ",
