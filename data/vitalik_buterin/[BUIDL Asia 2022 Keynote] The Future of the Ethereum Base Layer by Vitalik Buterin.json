        "0": "[Music] hello everyone so big news this year the merge is coming [Music] so this is uh the the merge this is ethereum's switch to a proof of stake this is uh something that we have been working on for the last like really the last seven years uh so work on ethereum's proof of stake protocol probably started around 2014. we started doing a lot of research on many different kinds of proof-of-stake protocols i tried to like understand uh issues around like what we weak subjectivity is what some of the differences between the different proof-of-stake protocols are how a traditional bft works in 2017 and we were published to the paper for a casper ffg and and the projects like slowly started turning from in from something ",
        "1": "more theoretical into something that's closer and closer to a reality uh so in december 2020 the ethereum beacon chain launched uh so in a december 2020 we launched the ethereum proof of stake chain and anyone could deposit their ether into the proof of stake chain and become an ethereum validator and the proof of stake chain has been working just running by itself for almost two years now and what's going to happen very soon is um the merge so the merge is when the existing proof of work chain stops working and all of the activity all of the accounts all of the transactions like everything on the existing ethereum chain is automatically migrated it's automatically moved to the proof of stake chain so this is the end of proof of work for ethereum it's a complete switch to proof-of-stake proof of stake will be finished after this and we'll be focusing on other upgrades so ",
        "2": "data sharding is one and plenty of other upgrades for ethereum as well so the ethereum protocol right now is in the middle of a long and complicated transition toward becoming a much more robust and uh much more powerful system right and the merge is uh only one um is only one part of this right so the merge is ethereum's switch to proof of stake aside from proof of stake we also care about sharding so increasing the ethereum protocol scalability the verge which is a switch moving ethereum over to verbal trees which will make it much easier to run an ethereum node and to verify blocks and so it'll make the ethereum network more decentralized and there are a lot of other smaller upgrades that are that are coming and that are being developed already as well ",
        "3": "so a lot of complicated things are happening in ethereum right now but this is all to help achieve the final goal of creating this base layer which is secure which is very decentralized and which is very scalable and on top of which it will be possible to build all of the blockchain applications and the whole blockchain future that we have always been dreaming of building so what are the goals of the ethereum base lawyer right so the ethereum the goals the the main goal is to be a dependable and secure base layer for applications and highly performance layer 2 scaling solutions so this gets us to ethereum's roll-up centric roadmap so this is a documents that i published almost two years ago and when i published this i think the ethereum community was moving in this direction already ",
        "4": "and the core idea here is what we call a rollup centric roadmap so the idea is instead of ethereum itself trying to scale and provide the [Music] very fast transactions and provide everything that users and applications need the ethereum base layer will focus on being a layer one uh so we'll focus on being a platform for platforms right so the the on instead of most users interacting with the ethereum base layer directly most users will interact with layer 2 scaling solutions so platforms like optimism arbitrarium zk sync starcnet scroll zk sync um fuel polygon you know the the list goes on so most activity most application will happen on these other platforms and the if you're the goal of the ethereum base layer will be to provide this like very safe and very secure layer on top of which these scaling solutions can live right ",
        "5": "so basically the layer one can focus on uh being uh decentralized uh the layer one can focus on being censorship resistant on on security on and on a reliability so on being a very simple um base or as simple as possible a base layer that is always there for its users where people it tries really hard to guarantee that anyone can always send transactions um onto the lawyer one so if someone tries to send a transaction they pay enough of a fee it's guaranteed that it will get on chain that the chain continues progressing that it doesn't have like 51 attacks that it doesn't revert um that it just tries to be as stable as possible as decentralized as possible in every way so this is the job of layer one right but we also have users right and users don't just need uh decentralization and censorship resistance users also need things like ",
        "6": "uh user friendliness low cost uh efficiency is speed right so for example uh transaction fees last year were about at one point more than five dollars per transaction right and more than five dollars per transaction is much too expensive uh so five more than five dollars per transaction is affordable for some use cases like if you're moving large amounts of money if you have an ens name that you're only updating once or twice a year but if you want to use blockchain applications every day or if you live in a low-income country and you just want to have a username then even five dollars per transaction is already much too expensive right so reducing costs for users is very important efficiency for users is uh is very important right uh we we want it to be possible for users to connect to the blockchain verify the blockchain send transactions to the blockchain do all of this quickly do all of this ",
        "7": "without consuming a large amount of resources and speed right so when a user sends a transaction it that transaction should be included and should be confirmed very quickly so these are all things that users need but these are things that if a layer one tries to achieve them directly they're like that adds a lot of risk to the layer one right like that that adds um a lot of risk that the layer one might become more centralized over the last two years we've been seeing these uh kind of debates around mev minor extractable value like miners and block producers using custom algorithms to try to like extract more profit more profits from ordering transactions and whether or not that can destabilize the economics of the blockchain and like having more of a split between lawyer one and layer two it reduces the risks from uh those kinds of situations right so if a lawyer one tries to do everything then there's a lot of risks that can uh come out of that like i could come out ",
        "8": "of one platform trying to do too much and even needing to keep adding features and keep adapting frequently so instead we split the two up and layer one focuses on being decentralized being scalable or that's our being secure being reliable uh being censorship resistant and over time changing less and less right i think a lot of people even have the ideal goal that eventually the layer one should like almost stop changing completely right the only at some point the only changes should be like for example changing the cryptography uh when quantum computers come so that so that layer one can continue to be safe but and then layer two would be the thing that changes more quickly would be the thing that focuses on scalability focuses on providing user experience and layer two would still get all of the uh security prop and all of the reliability properties from the layer one that it is sitting on top of uh so ",
        "9": "this is the goal right and over the last two years there has been a very large amount of progress in these roll-up systems so about three two weeks ago um at ecc in paris a lot of the zka evm implementations made some major announcements so zka vms basically means like xero knowledge zk snark based so based on zero knowledge proofs um like tools that can verify ethereum blocks right so you can take an ethereum block or an ethereum transaction put that inside of a rollup and you can have a very short very small cryptographic proof that tells that that can be verified on chain to prove that the entire block is correct but where the chain itself does not have to verify the entire block instead of verifying the entire block you verify of one very small proof right so ziggy's ",
        "10": "narcs are a very powerful technology for scalability uh we have been talking about zika snarks a lot for the last two or three years and i think we'll just continue talking about them even more for the next five to seven years but and there's a very good reason why right because ziggy snarks let you approve a very big computation once and then have a very small proof where everyone only needs to do a little bit of work to verify it so doing this for an ethereum block uh where the ethereum rules are fairly complicated has been a challenge but there are a lot of teams doing a very good job of implementing it and last month they all of these teams have made some like excellent uh like big announcements they've been showing a lot of progress um in addition to these like what i call pure zk evms there's also projects that are not quite zkevms uh so zk sync is one um and uh starkware with their cairo ",
        "11": "language there's a compiler from uh like solidity contracts to uh cairo that's being developed uh so that approach is like a little bit less compatible with ethereum but it's also a bit more efficient so there's a trade-off there and in the optimistic roll-up space um optimism and arbitrage have seen huge improvements in their efficiency in their simplicity in their maturity i mean their stability just a lot of things about optimism and arbitrary have improved a lot um in the last two years right and these are just a few projects so there's a lot of other layer two projects as well and ethereum's layer 2 ecosystem is this like very big space right now where there's just lots of people that are trying out like all of these new and very different strategies for how to create a scalable environment that applications can live in and where you users can actually have ",
        "12": "like very very quick very fast and very cheap transactions that look and feel the same way that they do on on ethereum today so roll ups are important right so how will ethereum post merge better support roll ups so dink sharding is so is probably the biggest thing that is we are going to be working on after the merge so we have been thinking about sharding almost us also since the project started so in 2015 uh people who have been in the ethereum community for a long time they might remember i published a long 50 page paper uh talking about how to do blockchain sharding and some very early ideas for doing that um so those ideas have continued to be worked on and more and more things have happened and now um those ideas have matured those ideas have evolved and after the roll-up centric roadmap those ideas have become ",
        "13": "a lot simpler right because once you have a roll up centric road map once you have this like separation between layer one and layer two it turns out that layer one does not have to shard computation it does not have to charge transactions it does not have to worry about oh you know how do we balance like which transactions go on this chart which transactions go on this shard the problem becomes much simpler the problem is how to distribute verification of data so basically what the way the dank sharding works is we have this new concept of a data transaction and a data transaction contains a pointer to a data blob a data blob is just a large piece of data and the ethereum blockchain does not verify that data right or it does not verify anything about that data the data is just a piece of data 124 kilobytes you can have anything inside of that piece ",
        "14": "of data and the blockchain is just there to verify that it exists right so the way that a node in ethereum will work in dig sharding is that there will still be this like central uh beacon chain so there will still be this ethereum chain same as it exists today and nodes would still download this chain it would still check this chain uh directly but um nodes would not check the download the data blobs directly instead they'll use this a protocol called data availability sampling to check these data blobs indirectly so instead of downloading the full data blob every node will only download a few random small pieces of a data blob so the idea here is to make this process of checking data much more efficient right so inside of every block the data blobs might would together would be about 16 megabytes but every node would only needs to download maybe like one 100 or 200 kilobytes uh so trying to again like make it ",
        "15": "make a chain that can process a larger amount of data but at the same time keep it very decentralized because every node only needs to process a very small amount of data so this is the ink sharding right so what tank charting does is it allows the layer one to cheaply provide a large amount of space that you can put data on and it's the job of the rollups to use this data and um basically to kind of compress a user's transactions and to put those transactions inside of that data and that's where the like the very cheap uh scale transactions and the scalability for layer twos can come from uh so full tank sharding is something that has taken a long time and will take a long time so before we are finished with full dank sharding uh there is this proposal called protodank charting that is actively being developed there's already implementations of it and the plan is to try to finish it as as soon as possible ",
        "16": "and prototank sharding basically says well we'll make these data blobs smaller we're not going to implement data available availability sampling yet but we're still going to give users some more data that they can use um in order so that rollups can scale more so that we can have more space for our transactions so eap 4844 prototyping charting this is also being developed um now vertical trees so i mentioned vertical trees briefly right the basic idea behind uh virtual trees is uh fairly simple uh right so the goal of a basically it's a different kind of tree structure that stores what we call the state so it stores things like accounts it stores things like smart contracts um it stores you know storage balance balances how much ether every account has what what the code of every smart contract is um and virgo tree is stored in a different ",
        "17": "format that makes it much easier to prove like what's what specific accounts are so you can it makes it much easier to prove that like this account has 100 ether this smart contract has this piece of code this smart contract has this has this storage and the goal of this is to make it possible to uh to build what we call stateless clients right so right now in ethereum node uh an ethereum node requires about 500 gigabytes of storage right it's uh it's pretty big with virgo trees with stainless clients you will be able to verify ethereum blocks without needing any storage at all right the the entire client will just run in memory so it will become much easier to run a node that verifies ethereum blocks that does kind of fully ver fully verifies the chain participates in the chain as a validator all of those things right it'll become much easier and this also maybe even opens the door to making to ",
        "18": "making the layer one bigger and to making the layer one um also have more space over time right so the uh and then after this longer term improvement uh single slot finality right so the idea of cinco swat finality basically instead of the current proof of stake chain where it only takes like it takes about 10 minutes to fully confirm to fully finalize every block with single swot finality blocks can be finalized like almost immediately right so within 30 seconds so the goal of all of these changes is i think one to make the layer one more secure to make the layer one stronger to make the layer one more decentralized but also to make the layer one a better platform on top of which all of these roll-up projects that people are working on can be built right so the all of these different improvements that we talk about right so vertical trees they're there to make it easier to run ",
        "19": "an ethereum node uh so that more people can run ethereum nodes so that more people can fully verify the chain um at the same time as this there's also work that's happening with the light clients so even if you don't want to fully verify ethereum blocks you can verify like parts of the ethereum consensus and so it will become easier and easier to have a wallet to participate in ethereum without having to trust infira for example right it'll be much easier to like have an experience where you can connect to the chain without having all of these like centralized intermediaries in the middle that you have to trust to control uh in in order to just like get information about what you're what what's going on or about what you're doing um so prototank charting creates more space for uh rollups right it create basically makes it it creates more space so that roll-ups have the ability to include more transactions so that roll-ups can have ",
        "20": "higher scalability um and so that all of these platforms that people are um that people are working on are going to like actually be able to support a very large number of transactions right so just to give some data here so ethereum today it can process about 20 transactions per second um depending on how complex those transactions are right if they're simple transactions it could go up to i think about 60 if they're more if their transactions like they are today on average about 20 and then very complicated transactions less than 20. with um roll-ups today if like everyone switched to roll-ups today then roll-ups could process maybe somewhere between like 2000 and six thousand transactions per second depending on how complex they are right and this is assuming that the roll-ups are like fully optimized right like there's there's still a lot of work that needs to be done in the roll-ups themselves uh to make them more ",
        "21": "efficient and to uh make them cheaper uh so i yeah i mean i actually published a a diagram of this on twitter about an hour ago where i talked about like how you can use compression to make transactions inside of roll-ups take up less space and this will just make roll-ups but even cheaper as well right so the layer one is getting better which will make roll-ups cheaper roll-ups are getting better which will make roll-ups even cheaper and so we can expect to see ethereum a few years from now being hundreds of times cheaper to sense transactions or have hundreds of times more users than it does today or both so a lot of things are happening um and with rollups and the chain is like improving and expanding um in a lot of ways to better support roll-ups um and roll-ups are doing a lot at improving um along um in all of these things right until layer one is doing a lot to improve on its decentralization and so just continue to be a better platform for uh that allows all ",
        "22": "of these different layer two protocols to live together to live on top of ethereum to benefit from sharing the same security uh so layer twos do not have to worry about having their own validator pools worrying about their own 51 attacks lawyer twos can just take advantage of the security that ethereum provides and add their own scalability and user experience on top which is a very powerful improvement so this is so that's the role of centric roadmap this is something that two years ago was a theory and two years ago it was an idea and a suggestion but over the last two years it has actually been happening we've seen a lot of improvements to roll-ups um we are about to see um the ethereum merge happen so the ethereum merge is the so the switch to proof of stake um so what's left until the merge right basically next week um we're expecting to see the ",
        "23": "merge of the of the robson test net uh so this is the last um ethereum merge that's or the last test net merge that's going to happen before we merge the ethereum main network and people are project or this the current expected timeline is that if there are no problems then the main net merge will happen sometime in mid to late september uh so the mainnet merge is looking very close people who are who have been following the process very closely who have been participating in the process are very excited and you know lots of people on the research side and especially for the last two years on the development side have worked very hard to get uh proof of stake to the point where uh where it is now um and in um you know very soon hopefully within two months the merge will finally be here um and ethereum will um you know fully be a proof-of-stake network much you know more secure much more difficult to attack um and the it will ",
        "24": "be 19 it will use more than 99.9 percent less energy than the ethereum proof of work network does today right so a lot of uh so perfect but proof of stake itself is only the first step right so after proof of stake there's some all of these different improvements um sharding to improve scalability vertical trees to improve decentralization single swat finality to improve security just all of these things that are happening in the layer one and the goal is to like bring the ethereum layer one to this place where it can be a very good layer one for supporting all of these very scalable layer two solutions that are building on top of it and where apple uh users and applications can move on can live on top of these lawyer tiers and pay much lower fees even then they pay today and to get to a point where layer one ",
        "25": "can become this kind of more stable and more robust thing that that actually does not need to change frequently right so this is um i think one of the other like really big ideas behind the two-layer road map right basically that it's not actually true that like layer one needs to keep on changing quickly and needs to keep on improving forever in order to kind of keep giving users an experience that keeps improving forever right layer one just needs to it needs to make some very important changes uh right now but after that like it just needs to be stable it needs to keep slowly improving slowly expanding space for data and um that might happen by itself as computers get better with more is a lie and the work of like constantly kind of veer and actively improving user experience and improving speed can mostly be a uh a layer two thing right and i think this is uh something that's actually happening um litecoin infrastructure ",
        "26": "right this is the um the last piece that i mentioned briefly uh so this is another kind of decentralization improvements basically four mobile wallets uh for wallets inside of browsers so metamask the brave wallets the status wallet any wallet any wallet on your phone like right now most of those wallets have to trust like some centralized providers so they have to trust in fiera for example and the ethereum base layer the after the merge has been designed with the goal of making it as easy as possible for users to verify things about the chain without having to trust a centralized provider right so instead of having to trust a central provider users will be able to just verify some proofs um and they'll so following the chain as a white client will require maybe somewhere between like i think 20 ",
        "27": "kilobytes and 100 kilobytes a day so extremely cheap almost as cheap as being a bitcoin white client um and it can be a program that just runs inside your browser runs inside your phone uses a very tiny amount of battery power and this is just something that mobile wallets will be able to include and will be able to plug into and so even users experience of interacting with a chain can continue to can become much safer right i think this is also an important topic to talk about because like i mean we saw i guess even uh yesterday with uh the solana wallet hack right like there's like it actually is dangerous to have these centralized dependencies right now in that case like it was a very serious example of like from what i saw they ended up actually sending like people seed phrases over to a server which is of course like a very dangerous thing to do right but like if you can even today with infuria like if all you can do is like take over a server and have it show the user different things ",
        "28": "then like that can also steal a lot of money from people right like that could get people to put wrong values in their unit swap transactions like make trades where those trades end up losing a lot of money like you can trick users into doing a lot of things if you just send them fake data about the chain right and so having more secure light clients that verify the chain directly also great improvement for security and that's improves the security of the chain improves the experience of users so um a lot of kind of very positive things can come out of that too right so that is the maybe next to three to five years so some goals for the longer term right so reducing the rate of changes over time uh so if we want to the layer one to be more developed more to become more stable and more dependable then layer one cannot change as quickly as it changes forever right and part of this is security like systems that change more slowly can be more can ",
        "29": "be more easily secure than systems that change very quickly and some of it is also just like the decentralization of ethereum right like it's uh like ethereum can for ethereum to continue to be decentralized and become more decentralized like it has to reduce over time with this dependence on like this question of oh you know what is the core developer team going to do next at some point like the core developer team should not even have the ability to like make very rapid changes quickly uh but in order to get to it like we actually have to go through this process right and at least do the changes that are important making it easier to run a live client making it easier to run a full client so making it easier to run a node that verifies the chin find some way to support faster confirmations so when you send a transaction today usually it takes like maybe 30 seconds before the transaction gets included and eap 1559 actually improved this a lot ",
        "30": "already by making the fee market more stable but and the merge will improve this by making block times more stable but there's there we think that there might be ways to make it basically to confirm give users a confirmation that their transactions will be included even like even faster than than in one block so give them like some kind of assurance some kind of a guarantee even within the um the span of one block um but um you know we can do this without centralizing the validator network so this is one of kind of important research goal for goals for us and also finally just you know continue to improve decentralization continue to improve robustness and continue to kind of make the layer one into it can being a more secure more decentralized layer one and a layer one where it's actually possible and there's enough tools so that people ",
        "31": "can continue to build these amazing layer 2 scaling solutions and protocols on top of it thank you [Applause] "
