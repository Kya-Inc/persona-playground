        "1": "pools collectively owned something like forty three to forty something like that percent of all of bitcoins hash power if you add in I think via BTC which is basically kind of affiliated with bit man altogether you have 53 percent so you already have this kind like fairly small mini cartel that has fifty three percent and that's 53 which has 51 percent plus two for those who can't add of the of the Bitcoin networks hash power and um you know what back in 2013 when G hash briefly had 51 percent like that was a big huge scare moment and everyone really complain the what and eventually you know like GG hash diplomatically backed down and went to and voluntarily job themselves to forty percent but now I know it's basically happening a second time and people just aren't really talking as much and then this time around right these um these aren't just pools right like sure ",
        "2": "technically the reports that people can participate in them but it's basically a plausible deniability strategy where the a very large portion of that is just hardware owned by a very small number of constant the doctors including the operators themselves and from the outside you can't really tell exactly how much actually is a real pool and how much it's just a front for their hardware so like first of all there's clearly incentive a large incentives to hide the real level of centralization and proof of work for like public relations reasons and clearly even despite that we can tell that the top three people it's like Verret wall court need a group of fools together has over half of the hash power and we can talk about geographic concentration so a couple of days ago there was that flood in h1 in China and that led to something like 20% of the hash power just suddenly getting knocked offline so like proof-of-work is like rich gets richer squared right so if we can get rich getting richer ^ one that's ",
        "3": "already a substantial improvement all right let's talk about security for a moment ordinary people read headlines but aetherium hacks and wrongly think that if there has been hacked and of course it's smart contract developers writing or buggy code can you talk about what you have mine to improve the state of affairs there I'm sure so yes so one of the important things there is that we need kind of continued ongoing development of better and more secure programming languages and standards so [Music] so one of the examples of this is that look recently another high-level programming language so something that compiles down to EVM code was released uh at least as a beta called Viper and Viper is a language that was designed from the start to be a kind of more restrictive and target readability and ",
        "4": "secure anymore and basically make it harder to screw up and make it harder to write deliberately misleading code so the design process for Viper basically was you know I'd take a kind of Python like language I much stronger type system and then look at the biggest you know ten screw-ups and they in solidity programming history and try to make features that deliberately make those as hard as possible or impossible entirely and that's been launched the that's where we saw so beta and that's something that's going to be a developing but we I think Shiva gave a grants to a group that was trying to make a another a high-level language for a theorem that was based on more and a functional programming principles so we are trying and then in solidity itself there's been a lot of improvement over the last year or so with like safe math libraries like different like stricter checks and all of those things so there are kind of multiple prongs of innovation happening on the programming language side that I do think will make writing a lot of these contracts more ",
        "5": "and more safe over time another thing that we're doing has to do or and wants to do more has to do with like basically just having good code samples and code templates so if you want to multi-sig wallet where do you go what do you implement for the components that are that standard there should just to be a standardized versions that have been audited that have been fully formally verified that are they are ready to use right and that's something that's not there yet but it's getting closer and closer to being there and so I think with better languages better standards better a better templates a better defaults we can get a gets really reducing the smart contracts security issues why a lot probably to the points where that's like at some points private key security once again becomes a dominant issue and then that's something that we want to really tackle as well since you bring up solidity bugs and multi-sig wallets there's a bunch of money sitting out there in what Sam ",
        "6": "called a long term savings account because of that parity multi-sig lost in limbo bug what do you think is going to happen to that money ultimately well so the only way that he can ever move right as if they're all there's two ways that it can move one way is that the etherium community agrees on a hard fork to move basically do somewhat modifications to the contract code in place or move the money somewhere else so it can be recovered and like that's continues to be mad I guess totally mathematically possible to do that but at the same time you know we saw with EIP and i9 there is there was that carbon vote which ended up voting against it there was quite a bit of negative getting your feedback on the github so in the short term it seems like you know like there's the the political will it's quite far from being able to actually push the push something like that forward the second way through which something like it can happen is of course if someone makes another blockchain which ",
        "7": "basically like hard spoons or ear drops or whatever like all of the etherium account balance says but makes the one modifications you want to watch the wallet and huh that's something that's like theoretically totally could happen and it's like technically one way in which that well it could become those funds from that wall it could become usable in some way and like without it and like compromising the block chains and the immutability by itself you know so like ultimately it is the community is the session and I want to try really hard to kind of not be you know myself be super super heavily involved in influencing that but you know you can kind of look at what all of the other people in the community have been like saying you know at the opinions that people have been expressing and some of the governance discourse so far and they can kind of see for yourself and look where the state of the discussion is that right now what is the chance that some look it'll end up changing in the ",
        "8": "future and so forth yeah that leads me to ask about your own role I mean right now you're both the celebrity public face and driving force behind aetherium and also kind of its chief scientist and I want to make Carl be the public face that was kind of my question so who's the Steve Ballmer - you're Bill Gates if you retreat back to chief scientists that girl makes sense hmm Oh admit to not be a kind of well versed enough in Microsoft history to know exact role beyond uh standing up and growing onstage and ranting about developers and something about open source being cancer and whatever but I should probably apologize to Carl for that analogy actually ya know I mean like so first of all like there is I am II Iguchi the executive director from the foundation who's been doing a quite a good job of kind of holding the fort on the administrative site and making sure that the foundation kind of keeps on the smoothly rolling and the the bureaucracy does more good than harm ",
        "9": "you think you yourself we're gonna be stepping back a little from I've been stepping back from like that side for quite a while there's obviously kind of all of the individual team leaders there's a lot of other people other people kind of on the management side they've been involved in an organization there's more and more different different people working on research different people working on development another important difference between the etherium foundation and something like Microsoft is that the etherium foundation trial is kind of very hard to be a decentralized organization and definitely not singling out Microsoft specifically I like pretty much all corporations or centralize organizations but like in the etherion foundation rightlook for example we try very hard not kind of not to have very hard divides of what you're on the inside you are on the outside this is a company party no one from the outside is allowed and in your you know this thing ",
        "10": "is company members only and so forth like basically because well there's multiple ways to interact with the etherium community and kind of through the theorem foundation right like you can become a full-time contributor you can apply for a grant and right now the budget of our grant program is larger than the budget of the Foundation's full-time staff itself you can work for some project in the etherium ecosystem you know like something like when we say go and at the same time just end up collaborating with aetherium foundation developers and researchers closely so like basically they're the kind of the de jure question of you know who is on what kind of payroll and the de facto question of who's a core member of the team whatever the team has often ended up they're diverging quite a lot and that's something which my hard to respect that's ",
        "11": "talk about privacy in other the areas were focusing on um the last three release had some free compiled zero knowledge primitives in it was which is the kind of mind-bending cryptography that Z cache for instance uses to shield the sender the receiver and the amount of a transaction from other eyes even though it's all publicly verified and guaranteed blockchain and are you moving more in that direction and absolutely yeah so first of all so what we did last year in october's we were always TAS update called by CN TM that uh as he just said opened up these these elliptic curve mathematic operations that basically optimize the math behind all sorts of privacy preserving cryptographic and zero knowledge proof constructions and there are already projects that are starting to use them to build various kinds of privacy preserving applications right like I know what there's one person in the community that was building a ring signature mixing contract there was one ",
        "12": "guy I forget a very white hat or something I don't even know what he actually is in person who had just released something on reddit about a month ago Ria's like oh look I I used the Z key snark function out of pre compose and aetherium and Zachary T is to build a zero zero knowledge a shielded token and it's already running on the test that and theoretically we could run on the main not tomorrow so like those kinds of signs are always really encouraging to see you in the longer term I think our kind of privacy role map has a few parts to it one of them is just kind of raw virtual machine optimization because the problem is basically at the virtual machine as it exists today is totally not optimized for cryptography and if we want if the virtual machine is faster then that means that more kinds of cryptographic primitives can be implemented right like the queered vm can be good for certain kinds of 256-bit stuff but there is so much wider space of things that it's not still not really performing well in ",
        "13": "right now but we have like efforts like webassembly and so forth to try to really improve on that the second one is and if participating in and supporting the development of zero knowledge of approved technologies so including kind of like the tooling around snark so we supported Socrates including development around Starks like I personally have written some of those a stark tutorial so you plan to be doing much more with Starks in the future I'm trying to kind of see like what would it take to actually make the theory I'm watching before anyway the Starks so that includes a for example like supporting finite field operations and other things involved in let's start in the stark verification looking at much more optimized hash functions so all of the kind of like tech technological building blocks to make it easier to build is your knowledge preserving privacy preserving schemes on top of the ethereum blockchain and then a third part of the research is problem that we haven't started yet but we want to start in is looking at kind of computing ",
        "14": "models that can be built on top of a theory I mean how the etherion base layer could be kind of modified to make it easier to build more what kind of well-designed programming abstractions for privacy on top so that includes zero knowledge encrypted smart contracts and includes all of these privacy preserving tokens basically how do we make it so these things aren't kind of like clumsy one offs that can't really talk to each other and have more have a kind of privacy preserving smart contract ecosystem that's as friendly to interact without that the existing totally not privacy-preserving smart contract ecosystem privacy preservation is a complex topic I mean Z cache Manero are kind of banned in Japan right now the Secret Service recently expressed concern about Z - are you concerned that this is going to attract kind of stern regulatory attention somewhere down the road uh you know I'm sure it'll happen though at the same time I think it's important to kind of keep in mind that dig in of water ",
        "15": "these cases and you know in the case of a theory I'm as well and what these are general-purpose technologies and they can be used definitely not just by criminals they can be used first of all by ordinary people just trying to hide the probe or protect the privacy of their payments they can be used by enterprises who need the privacy features to satisfy regulatory requirements um ironically enough they are needed and they can be you by um like various kinds of like applications and constructions on the blockchain to try to minimize the front-running and market manipulation they can be used and to create like to improve various kinds of mechanisms like auctions because the game theoretic proofs for why a lot of these mechanisms even work in the first place often has to do with some kind of some mechanism that's capable of preserving privacy of a lot of the inputs so there's a lot of ",
        "16": "kind of legitimate and a lot of perfectly tame uses for a lot of these technologies and also a lot of these technologies aren't there just for privacy they're also there for scalability right like more than half of the excitement in ZK snarks and ZK Starks isn't even because of the privacy angle it's because they allow you to prove arbitrarily complex computations in a single proof that can be very compact and verified in a few milliseconds so I you know I do hope that you know people see this kind of as a much wider array of general purpose applications for private privacy technologies you know what both in systems like Z cash hands you know again the more general purpose of the array with um applications and so forth so I mean absolutely but it seems like that at some point someone is going to use the theorem for something which is perceived as nefarious okay so here's my argument right I agree that this exists I actually disagree that we're more that we're going to marginally could you be too much and the reason is that like the ",
        "17": "you know it realistic we the darknet markets are already using Manero so there's not much that we can do it's a me to kind of like the the state of affairs from that standpoint and look larger than it already is but on the other hand you know if we continue working on usability and if you continue working on the kind of equality and security these technology is then we get the benefit that the technology has become more ready and accessible for use by regular people for privacy and security applications and and if like some knee-jerk regulator comes to you and looks at your history or hard works and says we have this thing we need you to fix we see you can fix it do you think you'll be able to talk them into seeing sense or do you think there'll be something that's standing sofirst us so I expect that the probability of regulatory responses that try to target blockchains themselves to be fairly low basically because that's like that's not the 80/20 right the 80/20 is basically as just banning exchanges so if they have problems those ban exchanges first ",
        "18": "and that's like the thing with developers is right that we're we're fairly fungible people you know we can kind of you know one developer goes down someone else can keep on developing if someone puts a gun to my head and tells me to write a hard for work patch I will definitely write a hard part for cash I will write the github issue I will write up the code I will publish it I will do everything they say if I do if I do this and I publish a hard work patch to delete file a bunch of accounts um how many people here would be willing to download and install the update and switch to that chain I see relatively few raised hands this is called decentralization let's move on to something a little more fun sure there's yeah I don't really like being uh forced the right hard fork badges like gunpoint as much as I'm sure I'd obliged if ",
        "19": "people asked television tokens for gaming and virtual collectibles replicas being the most obvious example so first I have to ask do you personally own any crypto keys mmm I think like two people gave me a couple crypto kiddies that I haven't really looked at them since but they're around [Laughter] there's also buzz about tokens being used for like in-game items for video games like yeah and I'm definitely kind of excited to see that there's interest in that kind of ecosystem oh admit to kind of not being immersed enough in the collectible game world to really understand it so I kind of understand the psychology of it well so it's just because of that is kind of hard for me to make predictions like I get that there's a lot of people that wants to be able to trade very kinds of in-game assets at the same time I know that like back in my days playing World of Warcraft's like the like ",
        "20": "blizzard and the world craft World of Warcraft community were very heavily against kind of allowing real money trade and they were in favor of like persecuting it as much as possible basically because they like the idea that World of Warcraft was this kind of mutual playground where you know you can't just easily get ahead by throwing a bunch of money out the problem and though I dunno know that like they did more recently they've kind of given up on that more and more I mean like basically the problem oh yeah I do kind of worry about this intersection of like basically how efficient markets end up interacting with you know the psychology of fun which often inherently ends up involving the psychology of challenge and how if it's not really that like if you can just dodge the challenge by paying two hundred forty-five dollars a guy who runs a human farm and like India or China or wherever they're located these days then you know I don't know I clearly there's a bunch of complex issues and I'm looking forward ",
        "21": "to fly from an observers point of view see how that aspect happens though like in the context of like asset trade ability actually happening I do think that it happening on a blockchain is a great idea because like it does mean that it creates this more neutral playing ground where you don't need and you don't have centralized providers and as much that ends up kind of like I'm taking over in the ecosystem as rent seekers you don't you have much more interoperability it becomes much easier for newer games to kind of plug themselves in it's you know you get much you get a lot of the existing infrastructure that's been created by the crypto community difficulty trading it's um it would be interesting to see what happens when a game server gets hacked for the first time and because it's running plasma everyone's plasma clients just automatically notice that the plasma server is like starting to misbehave and just send their transit their exit transactions on to the blockchain and you see this a really wonderful big splat with a bunch of ",
        "22": "transaction fees like it will happen at some point it'll just be interesting to see how it happens I mean in general it does seem like a good sort of next stage use case to bring the technology closer to the mainstream what do you see the user experience being like like suppose you've got arbitrary scalability but millions of people trading in game assets are they all actually gonna you know to get their own wallets and sign their own transactions or will they even be aware that there's a blockchain you know parceling the net behind the scenes have you seen it depends like a lot of this depends on where user authentication technologies go in the next decade or so is like basically right like a user work with a a user was a private key so there's not that much user experience difficulty of like signing your own transactions right it's not just that scary you basically just click a button and there's software running on your computer that doesn't much go up to curve multiplication so you create this like pile of mathematical gunk and you ",
        "23": "upload the pile of mathematical gunk to the blockchain and other sixteen thousand other nodes on the blockchain verify the mathematical gunk multiply up a bunch of elliptic curve points and you're done right but like all you see is you click a button and you see a confirmation the place where user experience kind of starts fraying is basically what happens if either your account gets hacked or if you lose your password and that's the aspect of user account authentication technology is that I'm interested in seeing where it evolved right because ultimately if kind of quote self solver and user authentication technology this ends up totally failing then that means that it is very difficult for the blockchain space to achieve substantial mass adoption or at least in a way that achieves you know a lot of the problem a lot of its promises you think we're gonna see like a one password for the blockchain private keys or a decentralized one password for possible that's one option like I'm I'm interested in social recovery I'm interested in kind of multi key schemes ",
        "24": "where you have one key and some server has one key I'm like social worker recovery is interesting like basically this is even used in some centralized systems today so it for example if you lose access to your WeChat accounts then one of the ways that you can recover it is you can kind of basically try while you get to the account and then you have to like basically select people like part of your security question is basically recognized which of these accounts are action with your contacts and then after that you basically the we shad ascends some of your your contacts confirmation codes and you have to tell them what kind of off-the-chain unquote offline to reply bat a reply back with a message confirming those confirmation codes and then if they do that then your account gets unlocked right so it's kind of an event social recovery and I know what you port is trying to do that on the blockchain so I'm trying to base I'm very interested in seeing how well those kinds of things end up turning out in practice I mean there's obviously ",
        "25": "Hardware wallets there's different forms of multi-sig there's like combined computer phone stuff like I'm hoping that we'll see much more of these models get tried and then we'll see if there is anything that ends up being both good enough for regular people to use and actually secure enough for regular people to be secure and you know if not then you know it will just fall back to everyone using coin based custody or whatever and that'll be much less fun but it will probably still kind of work and it'll be better than the status quo the first ICS was for utility tokens and there's a lot of buzz lately about security tokens which represent which actually are shares in the company or fractional ownership of yeah real estate do you think that's a significant development and do you think have a big you think it's going to be compared to utility tokens in tokenizing real-world assets whether they're securities or gold or bonds or like fiat or like I don't know what pixels of some Banksy ",
        "26": "photo or whatever I think is like all interesting I guess the question is what value are you getting by blocks unifying it and the value that I personally see is that like first of all you get access to this open ecosystem of tools where you can trade it and where you can trade these tokens you can do things with them you can use them as collateral and other applications you can use you can use them as I mean me means of payments you can use them too you can store them you can do financial contracts off of them and all of this and this is all happening on an open ecosystem and basically any year c20 Tolkien couldn't work with any application that supports CRC 20 tokens and I could see how a lot of innovation could potentially end up as bringing out of that so that's something that I'm definitely kind of excited by um as far as like tokenizing art I am I know there's people excited about that though I know there's also like not that much of that happening in ",
        "27": "practice and in other words people skeptical of it like it doesn't seem psychologically that easy for people to make the leap from paying forty million dollars for a Mona Lisa painting to paying forty million dollars for a digital private key thingamajig that claims that it has some arbitrary attachment to a Mona Lisa painting and that's like okay fine I understand that I don't really understand the art world in general anyway when you can just like photo make a copy that works almost identical exchanges Abbe it's a huge business that we're seeing interesting growth and decentralized exchanges the protocol era swap and so forth and you know everyone agrees were in the early days of cryptocurrency is do you think there's a chance that you know down the road decentralized exchanges will be with the ",
        "28": "majority of the action is and centralized exchanges were like an offense in a femoral blood or do you think they'll be a bizarre occasional use case and I definitely personally hope centralized exchanges burn in hell as much as possible I mean in in practice like first of all clearly I think on the Fiat to crypto side it's very difficult to decentralize because you know you ultimately are interfacing with the Fiat world and the Fiat world is one that only has basically centralized gateways so I do think that there's valuable services that are being provided there that are very hard to decentralize on the Krypton with a Krypton side like these I used I do think that like it's still early days and I second all Gia's going to become more and more efficient over time and at some point we are going to see a world where it becomes much easier to fairly quickly turn a token of one kind into it so into a token of any other kind like basically ",
        "29": "with the decentralized exchanges available today right like they one of the nice things is that they already have a nice usability gain which is that you don't have to like register a login create an account to go to some stupid web interface all you do is you just send tokens of one type to one address and then you immediately get tokens back of another address it's like from a user experience point of view it's great and you know that is obviously something that needs to be refined a lot more around the edges but it's something that I do think we are going to kind of start seeing more and more of now we're you know a large scale traders professional traders you know the high frequency trading ecosystem and so forth are going to go that's in still remains to be seen and it is a you know we'll see how the technology goes I'm what kind of fairly uncertain on this so you know ultimately I guess might like the better dissension like even if centralized exchanges end up having a lot of volume like the better decentralized exchanges are at the bit as a baseline kind of the more ",

        "31": "what the social contract is and so there isn't a scenario we are you know like plenty of people just kind of including me assumed all along that like when the number of transactions hits the block size the thing that will obviously happen is the block size will just get a hard work to keep on increasing and then other people have a different idea and the other two sides just totally don't even realize that there's an E and at the other side that had that had a totally different conception for them and then the and then they kind of start fighting to maintain their expectations like in our case the social contract was always won in favor of ongoing evolution proof of stake sharding and there definitely are disagreements about how best to implement some of these technologies but at the same time like there's um I at this point saying like people I think to the extent that those disagreements exist every everyone involved in the disagreement is convinced that they are opponent to the the thing that they're opponents in the disagreement proposes even that in its ",

        "38": "monopolistic cartel and that's something an infrastructure that people like are willing to build on so I think like you know first of all I totally agree that in a lot of industries compromises between the kind of you know utopian ideals and the real kind of resilience benefits of decentralization on the one side and the real kind of efficiency needs and sometimes regulatory needs of centralization on the other side or if you are very much needed I just don't think like but consortium chains are not the only way to make that compromise right like plasma chains even plasma chains that act as centralized servers or another way to make that compromise and I think in many cases there might even be a better way to make that compromise right like what you do is you basically do whatever the centralized thing is that you were doing before but then like basically in incorporate the Merkle trees incorporate blockchain commitments and in the right way not the wrong way and you build a client and you have an interface where ",
        "39": "the server basically just keeps on publishing merkel branches to the clients and then into the clients you give them the ability to do these plots or participate in this plasma exit mechanism and there you go you have a system that has the efficiency of a centralized server almost the same code as a centralized server just have to route a wrapping layer on top but it also has this kind of resilience of having a public key and fallback you have the server ends up breaking and sneaking a super quick final question since we have 40 seconds left um which other blocked is interested by which we could measurably which are the block chains do you actually have private keys for for experimental reasons there whichever ooh well a lot of this is the kind of historical reasons but Bitcoin Bitcoin cash Bitcoin gold uranium white diamonds Bitcoin carbon dioxide No let's see um I got some dough I think I think I got some sea cash in all sorts ",
        "40": "of aetherium based tokens right yeah all right you know me a kind of technical standpoint say I do find the sea cash team you know like interesting and highly competent and I do value they're kind of like queer and kind of like well expressed commitments to privacy him I think they're one of the other project that's like really gotten the culture thing down well yeah alright thank you very much [Applause] [Music] "
