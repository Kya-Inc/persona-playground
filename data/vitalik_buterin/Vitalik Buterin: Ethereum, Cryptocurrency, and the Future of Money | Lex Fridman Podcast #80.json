        "5": "sort of asking the question what did uh satoshi nakamoto actually invent maybe you could say who is satoshi nakamoto and what did he invent sure so satoshi nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with bitcoin so the reason why i say the name by which we know is that this is a anonymous uh fellow who has uh shown himself to us only um over the internet uh just by first publishing the white paper uh for bitcoin and then releasing the original source code for bitcoin and then talking to the very early bitcoin community on bitcoin forums and and of interacting with them and helping the project along for a couple of years um and then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011 he disappeared uh so bitcoin is uh a fairly unique project ",
        "6": "and how it has this kind of mythical kind of quasi-god-like founder who just kind of popped in and did the thing and it disappeared and we've somehow just never heard from him again so in 2008 was so the white paper was the first do you know if the white paper was the first time the name would actually appear satoshi nakamoto believe so so how is it possible that the creator of such a impactful project remains anonymous that's a tough question and there's no similarity to it in history of technology as far as i'm aware yeah so one possibility is that it's hal finny um because uh hell finney was kind of also active in the bitcoin community and as um how finney um in those uh two beginning years and uh how who is how thin he may be he is one of the people in the end of early cypherpunk community ",
        "7": "he was a computer scientist just yeah computer scientists cryptographers people interested in uh like technology internet freedom like those kinds of topics was it correct that i read that he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest or the first transaction of bitcoin yes the first transaction of bitcoin was between sister oshie and alfini do you think he knew who satoshi was if he wasn't satoshi you probably know how is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamental identity is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet like if we were to think about it because you and i just met now there's a there's a depth of knowledge that we we now have about each other that's like physical like my vision system is able to recognize you i can also verify your identity of ",
        "8": "uniqueness like yep like it's very hard to fake you being you yes so the internet the internet has a fundamentally different quality to it which is just fascinating yeah i know this is definitely interesting because i definitely just know a lot of people just by their internet handles and like to me when i think of them like i see their internet handles and one of them has enough profile pictures this kind of face that's kind of not quite human with a bunch of kind of psychedelic colors in it and when i visualize him i could just visualize that that's not an actual face yeah you are the creator of the second well he's currently the second most popular cryptocurrency uh ethereum so on this topic if we just stick on satoshi nakamoto for for a little bit longer you may be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking about like ",
        "9": "your identity is known like i've just verified it but uh from your perspective what are the benefits in uh creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining anonymous like if it can psychoanalyze satoshi nakamoto is there something interesting there or is it just a peculiar quirk of him it definitely helps create this uh kind of image of this kind of neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone and then you've created a project and because you're anonymous and because uh you also have uh disappear or as unfortunately happened to how finny if that is him he ended up i think dying of a lou gehrig's disease and he is in a cryogenic freezer now but like if you pop in and you d and then you create it and and you're gone and uh all that's remaining of uh that whole process is the thing itself then like no one can go and try to ",
        "10": "um and if interpret any of your other behavior and try to understand like oh the this person wrote this thing um in some essay at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy and so because of that this project is like is a statement that's trying to do this specific thing instead it creates uh this uh environment where the thing is what you make of it and it doesn't have the yeah right the the burden of your other ideas political thought and so on so so now that we're sitting with you do you feel the burden of being kind of the face of ethereum i mean there's a very large community of developers but nevertheless yeah is there like a burden associated with that there definitely is this is uh definitely a big reason why i've been trying to kind of push for the ethereum ecosystem to become more decentralized ",
        "11": "in many ways just encouraging a lot of kind of core ethereum work to happen outside of the ethereum foundation and of expanding the number of people that are making different kinds of decisions having multiple software limitations instead of one and all of these things like there's a lot of things that i've tried to do to and remove myself as a single point of failure because that is something that a lot of people criticism criticize me for um so if you look at like the most fundamentally successful open source projects it seems that it's like a sad reality when i think about it is it seems to be that one person is a crucial contributor often you feel like a lioness from from uh for the for linux for the colonel yeah that is possible and i'm definitely not planning to disappear that's an interesting tension that projects like this kind of ",
        "12": "desire a single entity and yet they're fundamentally distributed i don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking about the future of cryptocurrency does there need to be a leader there's different kinds of leaders you know there's uh there's dictators who control all the money there's people who control organizations there's uh kind of high priests that just have themselves on their twitter followers what kind of leader are you would you say yeah in these days actually a bit more in the hype in the high priest direction than before yeah like i definitely actually don't do all that much of kind of going around and like ordering ethereum foundation people to do things because i think those things are important i if there's something that i do think is important that you i do just usually kind of say it publicly or just kind of say it to people and ",
        "13": "quite often projects just going to start doing it so let's ask the high philosophical question about money yeah what at the highest level is money what is money it's a kind of game and it's a game where you know we have points and if you have points there's this one move where you can reduce your points by a number and increase someone else's voice by the same number and these so it's a fair game hopefully well it's one kind of fair game like for example you know you can have other kinds of fair games like you're gonna have a game where if i give someone a point and you give someone a points and instead of that person getting two points that person gets four points and that's also fair but no money is um easy to kind of set up and it serves a lot of useful functions and so it kind of just survives in the society as a meme for thousands of years it's useful for this storage of wealth ",
        "14": "it's useful for the uh exchange of value and it's also useful for denominating future payments a unit of account a unit of account so what if you look at the history of money in human civilization what just uh if if you're a student of history like how has this role or just the mechanisms of money changed over time in your view even if we just look at the 20th century before and then leading up to cryptocurrencies that's something you think about yeah and i think like the big thing in the 20th century is kind of we saw a lot more intermediation i guess like you know i mean the first part is kind of the move from being adding more of different kinds of banking and then i used we saw the move from and of dollars being backed by gold to dollars being backed by gold that's only redeemable by certain people the dollars not being backed by anything um to and ",
        "15": "it's just this uh nerf system where you have a bunch of free floating currencies and then people like um getting out of bank accounts and then those things becoming electronic people getting accounts with payment processors that have account um bank accounts so so what what do you make of that is that's such a fascinating philosophical idea that money might not be backed by anything what is that like fascinating to you that money can exist without being backed by something physical it definitely is like what do you make of that like how is that possible is that stable if we look at the future of human civilization is it possible to have money at the large scale at such a hugely productive and rich societies be able to operate successfully without money being backed by anything physical i feel like the interesting thing about the 21st century especially is that ",
        "16": "a lot of the important valuable things are not backed by anything like if you look at like tech companies for example like something like twitter like you could theoretically imagine that if all of the employees wanted to they could kind of come together they would quit and you know start working on twitter 2.0 and then the value of um and just kind of build the exact the the exact same product of course possibly build a better product and then just kind of continue on from there and the original the original twitter would kind of just not have people left anymore right like the there is theoretically kind of code and like ip that's owned by the company but in reality like good programmers could probably read up rewrite all that stuff in three months so the like the reason why the thing has value is just kind of network effects and coordination problems right like these employees in reality aren't going to switch all at once and also the users ",
        "17": "aren't um all going to switch them at once because it's just difficult for them to switch at once and so there's these kind of meta-stable of equilibrium in the interactions between thousands and millions of people that are just actually quite sticky even though if you try to kind of assume that everyone's a perfectly rational and kind of perfectly slippery spherical cow they don't seem to exist at all this that stickiness do you have a sense of grasp of the sort of the fun fundamental dynamic like the physics of that stickiness it seems to work but uh and i think some of the cryptocurrency ideas kind of rely on it working yeah it's uh you know it's the sort of thing that's definitely been uh economically modeled a lot like one uh the kind of analogy of something as similar that uh you often see in textbooks as like what is a government like if for exa ",
        "18": "like 80 percent of uh people in a country just like tomorrow suddenly had had the idea that like the laws that are currently the laws in the government that currently is the government are just people and some and some other thing is the government and they just kind of start acting like it then that will kind of become the new reality and then the question is well what happens if and if between zero and 80 people or and 80 of people start believing that and like what is uh the thing you also you see is that if there is one of these kind of switches happening this kind of revolution then if you're the first person to join then like you probably probably don't have the incentive to do that but then if you're the 55th percentile person to join then suddenly becomes quite safe too and so this definitely is the sort of thing that you can kind of try to analyze and understand mathematically but one of the ",
        "19": "kind of results is that the sort of like when the switch happens definitely can be chaotic sometimes yeah but still like to me the idea that uh the network affects the the fact that human beings at a scale like millions billions can share even the idea of currency like all agree that's just uh i know economics can model it i'm a skeptic on economic and uh it's like uh so my my favorite sort of field maybe recreationally psychology is trying to understand human behavior and i i think sometimes people just kind of pretend that they can have a grasp on human behavior even though we it's such a messy space that all the models that psychology or economics those different perspectives on human behavior can have or are difficult it's difficult to know how much that's wishful thinking and how much it is actually getting to the core of understanding human behavior but on that idea ",
        "20": "what do you think is the role of money in human motivation so do you think money from an economics perspective from a psychology perspective is core to like human desires money is definitely very far from the only motivator um it is a big motivator and it's uh one of the closest things you have to a universal motivator i think because ultimately in like almost any person in the world if you ask them to do something like they'll be more inclined to do it if you also offer some uh offer the money right and that's uh there's definitely many cases where people will do things other than things that maximize how much money they have and that happens all the time but like though a lot of those other things are kind of but much more specific to and of who that person is and of what their situation is the relationship between the motive and the ",
        "21": "action and these other things what do you think is in the interplay of the other motivator from like nietzsche perspective is power do you think money equals power do you think those are conflicting ideas do you think i mean that's the one of the ideas that decentralized currency decentralized applications are looking at is who holds the power yeah money is definitely a kind of power and there's definitely people who want money because it gives them power and then even if my money doesn't seem to and explicitly be about money a lot of uh things that people spend money on are ultimately about a social status of some kind um so i mean i definitely view those two things as kind of interplaying and then there's also money as just a way of uh like measuring how successful you are i guess a scoreboard right so this kind of gets back to the game like if ",
        "22": "you have four billion dollars then the main benefit you get from going up well one of the big benefits you get from going up to six million dollars is that now instead of uh being below the guy who has five you're above the guy who has five so you think money could be kind of uh in a game of life it's also a measure of self-worth it's like how we it's definitely how uh how a lot of people perceive it define ourselves in the hierarchy of yeah and i'm not yeah not saying it's kind of a healthy thing that people define their self-worth as money because it's definitely kind of far from a yeah perfect indicator of like how much you like value you provide to society or anything like this but i i definitely think that like as a matter of kind of current practice a bunch of people do feel that way so what does utopia from an economic perspective look like to you what does the perfect world look like ",
        "23": "i guess like the economists say utopia would be one where kind of everything is an of incentive aligns in this um in the sense that there aren't enough conflicts between what satisfies your goals and kind of what is uh good for and everyone in the world um in the world as a whole what do you think that would um look like does does that mean they're still poor people and rich people there's still income inequality do you think sort of uh marxist ideas are strong do you think sort of ideas of objectivism uh like where the market rules is strong like what is there is the different economic philosophies that just seem to be reflective of what utopia would be so i definitely think that existing economic philosophies do end up kind of systematically kind of deviating from ",
        "24": "the utopia in a lot of ways yeah like one of the big things i talk about for example is public goods right and public goods are especially important on the internet right yeah because like the idea is with kind of money as this game where you know i was a few coins a few coins and you gain the same number of coins is that this usually happens in a trade where i lose some money you gain some money you lose a sandwich and i gain a sandwich and this kind of model works really well when the thing that we're using money to incentivize the set of private goods right things that you provide to one person where the benefit comes to one person but the like on the internet especially but also many many contacts kind of off the internet there's actions that kind of individuals or groups can take where instead of the benefit going to one person the benefit just goes to many people at the same time and you can't ",
        "25": "control who the benefit goes to right so for example this podcast you know we publish it and when it's published you don't have any fine grains control over like oh these 38 000 people can watch it and then like these other 29 000 people can't it's like once the number goes high enough then you know people will just like copy it and then when i write articles on a blog then they're just like free for everyone and that stuff's even harder to prevent anyone from copying so and aside from that things like you know scientific research for example and even taking more pedestrian examples like climate change mitigation would be a big one um so there's a lot of things in the world where you have these kind of individual actions with have concentrated costs and distributed benefits and money as a point system does not do a good job of encouraging these things and one of the kind of other things even ",
        "26": "kind of tangentially connected to crypto but kind of theoretically outside of it that i work on is this sort of mechanism called quadratic funding um and the way to think about it is and i've imagine a point system where if uh like if one person gives a coin gives coins to one other person then it works the same way as money but if multiple people uh give coins to one person and they do so anonymously so it's kind of not in consideration for a specific service to that person themselves and then the number of coins received by that person is kind of greater than just the sum of the number of coins that have given by those different people um so the actual formula is you take the square root of the amount that each person gave then you add all the square roots and then you had to square the sums yeah and then you give that and the idea here would basically be that if let's say for example you just started going off and kind of ",
        "27": "planting a lot of trees and there's a bunch of people that are really happy that you're planting trees and so they go and all kind of throw a coin um your way then the like there is like basically the fact that kind of you get more than the sum you get this kind of square of some of these of uh of square roots of these tiny amounts is them that this actually kind of compensates for the tragedy of the comments right in this there's even this kind of mathematical proof that it sort of optimally compensates for it what is the tragedy of the common um this is just this idea that like if there is this uh situation where there's some public good that lots of people benefit from then no individual person wants to contribute to it because if they contribute they only get a small part of the benefit from their contribution but they pay the full cost of their contribution in which context does this um sorry what is the term quadratic quadratic funding ",
        "28": "like what's in which context is this mechanism useful so obviously you said to to combat the tragedy of the commons but yeah in which context do you see it as useful actually practically yeah theoretically public goods in general right so like like services like what what are we what are we talking about what's the public yeah so within the um ethereum ecosystem for example like we've actually tried using this mechanism i yeah wrote a couple of articles about the cinevon vitalic.ca where i go through some of the most recent rounds and it's been really interesting um some of the top ones that people supported there were things like kind of just online user interfaces that make it easier for people to interact with ethereum there was documentation there were podcasts there were enough software kind of clients like kind of implementations of the ethereum ",
        "29": "protocol of privacy tools just like lots of things that are useful to lots of people when a lot of people are contributing like funding a particular particular entity yeah uh that's really that's really interesting is there something special about the quadratic the the the summing of the square roots yeah so another way to think about it is like imagine if n people each give a dollar then the person gets n squared right um and and so each individual person's uh contribution gets multiplied by n right because you have n people yeah um and so that kind of perfectly compensates for the kind of kind of anti-1 uh tragedy of the commons i just wonder if the the squared part is yeah how fundamental no it is um and i'd uh recommend you go to uh on vitalik.ca i have this article called a quadratic payments a primer and highly recommended it's kind of at least my attempt so far and explaining the ",
        "30": "intuition behind this intuition so if we could can we go to the the very basic what is the blockchain or perhaps we might even start at the uh the byzantine generals problem in byzantine fault tolerance in general that i i bitcoin was taking steps to uh providing a solution for so the byzantine generals problem it's this uh paper that uh leslie lamport uh published in 1982 where he has this thought experiments where if you have two generals that are have camped out on opposite sides of a city and they're planning when to attack the city then the question is and if how could those generals coordinate with each other and they could send message messengers between each other but those messengers kind of could get sniped by the enemy on the road some of those messages could end up ",
        "31": "being traders and if things could end up happening and with just two mess generals it turns out that there's kind of no solution in a finite number of rounds that guarantees that they will be able to coordinate on the same answer um but then in the case where you have more than two generals and then leslie analyzes cases like um are the mess and messages kind of just oral messages are the messages kind of signed messages so i can give you a signed message and then you can pass along that signed message and the third party can still verify that i originally made that message and depending on those different cases there's kind of different bounds on like given how many generals and how many traders um among those generals kind of whether like under one conditions you actually can't agree when to launch an attack uh so it's actually a big misconception that ",
        "32": "the the byzantine general's problem was unsolved so listen lanport solved it the thing that was unsolved though is that all of these solutions assume that you've already agreed on a fixed list of who the generals are and these generals have to be kind of semi-trusted to some extent they can't just be anonymous people because if they're anonymous then like the enemy could just be 99 of the generals so right then in the 1980s and the 1990s kind of the general use case for distributed system stuff was more kind of enterprisey stuff where you could kind of assume that uh you know you know who the nodes are that are running these nf computer networks so if you wants to have some in a decentralized computer network that pretends to be a single computer and that you can kind of do do a lot of operations on then it's made out of these kind of 15 specific computers and we know kind of who and where they are and so we have a ",
        "33": "good reason to believe that say at least 11 of them would be fine and then it could also be within a single system exactly almost a network of devices sensors so on like in airplanes and i think uh like flight systems in general still use these kinds of ideas yep yep um so that's the 80s that's the it is the 90s now the cypherpunks had a different use case in mind which is that they wanted to create a fully a decentralized global permissionless currency and the problem here is that they didn't want any authorities and they didn't even want any kind of privileged list of people and so now the question is well how do you use these techniques to create consensus when you have no way of kind of measuring identities right you have no way of kind of determining whether or not some 99 of participants aren't actually all the same guy and so the clever solution that satoshi had this is uh kind of going back to the ",
        "34": "that presentation i made at defcon a few months ago where i said that the thing satoshi invented with crypto economics is this uh really neat idea that you can use economic resources to kind of limit identity how many identities you can get and the uh if there isn't any existing decentralized digital currency then the only way to do this is with proof of work right so with proof of work the solution is just you publish a solution to a hard mathematical puzzle that takes some uh kind of clearly calculable amount of computational power to solve you get an identity and then you solve five of those puzzles you get five identities and then these are the identities that we run the consensus algorithm between so the proof-of-work mechanism you just described is like the fundamental idea proposed in the in the white paper that defines ",
        "35": "bitcoin uh what's the idea of consensus that we wish to reach what why is consensus important here what is consensus so the goal here in just simple technical terms is to basically kind of wire together a set of a large number of computers in such a way that they yeah kind of pretends to the outside world to be a single computer where that single computer keeps working even if a large portion of the kind of constituents the computers that make it up break and kind of break in arbitrary ways like they could shut off they could uh try to actively break a system they could do lots of mean things so the reason why the cypherpunks wanted to do this is because they wanted to run one particular program on this virtual computer and the one particular program that they wanted to run is just a currency system right it's a system that just processes a series of transactions ",
        "36": "and for every transaction it verifies uh that the sender has enough coins to pay for the transaction and verifies that the digital signature is correct and if the check's passed then it subtracts the coins from one account and adds the coins to the other account roughly so first of all the the the proof-of-work idea is kind of i mean at least to me seems pretty fascinating it is i mean that's a it's kind of a revolutionary idea i mean is is it is it obvious to come up with that you can use uh you can exchange basically computational resources for for identity it's uh it actually has a pretty long history it was uh first proposed in a paper by uh cynthia dwork and [Music] neor in 1994 i believe and the original use case was uh combating email spam so the idea is that if you send an email you have to send it with a proof of work attached and like this makes it reasonably cheap to ",
        "37": "send emails to your friends but it makes it really expensive to send spam to a million people yeah that's a simple brilliant idea so maybe also taking a step back so what is the role of blockchain in this what is the blockchain sure so the blockchain i mean my way of thinking about it is that it is this kind of system where you have this kind of one virtual computer created by this a bunch of these uh uh nodes in the network um and the reason why the term blockchain is used is because the data structure that these systems use at least so far is one uh where they um even if different nodes in the network periodically publish blocks and a block is a kind of list of transactions uh together with a pointer like a hash of a yeah a previous block that it builds on top of um and so you have a series of blocks that that ",
        "38": "nodes in the network create where each block points to the previous block and so you have this chain of them is a fault tolerance mechanism built into the idea of blockchain or is there a lot of possibilities of different ways to make sure there's no funny stuff going on there are indeed a lot of possibilities um so in a kind of just simple architecture as i just described the way the fault tolerance happens is like this right so you have a bunch of nodes and they're just happily and occasionally creating blocks building on top of each other's uh blocks and let's say you have kind of one block we'll call it kind of block one and then someone else builds another block on a steel called block two then we have an attacker and what the attacker tries to do is the attacker tries to revert block two and the way they revert block two is instead of doing the thing they're supposed to do which is build a block on top of block two they're gonna build another block on top of block one um so you have block one which has two children block two and ",

        "79": "[Music] much more price stability than they have today and i mean there are now stable coins and there are kind of cryptic cryptocurrencies that try to be more stable than existing things like bitcoin and ether but that just is to me kind of the main challenge do you think oh that's do you think that's a characteristic of this just being the early days it's such a young concept that 10 years is nothing in the history of money yeah and i think it's a combination of two things right one is um it's uh it's still early days but the other is a kind of more durable any kind of economic problem which is that like demand for currency is volatile right because of like recessions booms changes to technology lots of things and if people's demand for how much currency they want to hold changes and if you have a currency that has a fixed supply then the change in demand has to be entirely expressed as a change in value of the currency and so what that ",
        "80": "means is that kind of the volatility of demand becomes entirely translated into volatility and ahead of prices of things that dominated in that currency but if you have a currency where instead the supply can change and so the supply can go up when there's more demand than you have the supply and of absorbing more of that volatility and so the price of the currency would absorb less of the volatility on that topic so bitcoin does have a limited supply specific fixed supply yes uh what's what's the idea and the ethereum doesn't but can you clarify just in the comments you just made is ethereum qualify to the kind of currency that you're talking about and being flexible in the supply and it's a bit more flexible but kind of the thing that you would really want is something that's kind of specifically flexible in response to how valuable the currency is and and i'd recommend you to look at stable ",
        "81": "coins as well so like things like die for example that's a new like how do you spell that dai and what uh what's stable coins is that a type of cryptocurrency it is a type of cryptocurrency it's um a type of cryptocurrency that's issued by a smart contract one of these ethereum computer programs that um where the smart contract holds a bunch of ether and then it is basically like that people deposit and then at issues die and the reason why people deposit is because they wants to kind of go high leverage on their ether and so it kind of pairs these two sets of users one that wants stability and one that kind of wants extra risk together with each other and it basically creates some or gives one set of participants a guarantee that they'll be pa uh that they have this asset that can that that can be later converted back into ether but like specifically out kind of the one dollar raid and it has some kind of uh stabilizing network effects ",
        "82": "yeah it has this yeah it has many kinds of stabilizing mechanisms in it that's fascinating okay this this world is awesome technically just from a scientific perspective it's an awesome world uh that i i often don't see from an outsider's perspective what i often see is kind of uh maybe hype and a little bit if i may say so like charltonism and you don't often see at least from an outsider's perspective the beautiful science of it and the engineering of it maybe is there a comment you can make of who to follow how to learn about this world without being interrupted by the charlatans and the hype people in the space i think you do need to just know the specific kind of just people to follow like there's and there's all the kind of the cryptographers and the researchers and then there's just like even just the ethereum research crew ",
        "83": "like myself you know like dan crowd danny justin of the other people and then and if the academic cryptographers and like before um um this today was at stanford and uh stanford has the center for blockchain research and of dan bonnet that's really uh famous and great cryptographer um running it and there's a lot of other people there and there's people working on like zero knowledge proofs for example and um zuko from uh zcash has kind of one other person that i yeah you know respect so i think if you follow the technology you crawl along that yeah yeah you just start with the etherium group and then look at the academics dave and so on and then just cautiously expand the network of people you follow yeah exactly and like if someone seems too too self-promotional then just like remove them is there books that are so there's these white papers and we ",

        "85": "enemy of digital currency of distributed currency or can they be like cautious friends i mean i think like the one thing that people forget is that it's clearly not entirely an enemy because i think uh if uh there hadn't been so much government regulation on and if centralized uh digi like issuing centralized digital currencies then like we would be seeing things with people like google and facebook and twitter just kind of issuing them left and right and then like if that was the case then decentralized currencies would still appeal to some people but they definitely would appeal to less people than today so even in that sense i think it's uh clearly been kind of more of a help i just kind of set the stage for the end of the existence as a of the sector in some ways um but also and i think some of both you know like ",
        "86": "there's definitely things that governments kind of can do in some cases have done to have hurt the spread of uh and of growth of of blockchains there's uh things that they've done to help and they've in some cases definitely done a good job of kind of going after fraudulent projects and they're going after some of the projects that have some of the kind of craziest and most misleading marketing um there's uh also the possibility that governments will end up using blockchains for a lot of different things like you know governments yeah i mean they do a lot more than just regulating right but there's also like they have the identity of records and they have like property registry is even just their own currency is like security lots of different kind of things that they're operating and there's even blockchain applications in a lot of those and they can you know ",
