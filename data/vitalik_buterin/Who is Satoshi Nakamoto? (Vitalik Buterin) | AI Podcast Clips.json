        "0": "so before we talk about the fundamental ideas behind a theory I'm a cryptocurrency perhaps it'd be nice to talk about the the origin story of Bitcoin and the mystery of Satoshi Nakamoto you give a talk that started with sort of asking the question what did Satoshi Nakamoto actually invent maybe you could say who is Toshi Nakamoto and what did he invent sure so Satoshi Nakamoto is the name by which we know the person who originally came up with Bitcoin so the reason why I say the name by which we know is that this is a yam anonymous fellow who has shown himself to us only over the internet just step by here first publishing the white paper for Bitcoin then releasing the original source code for Bitcoin and then talking to the very early Bitcoin community on Bitcoin forums and and if ",
        "1": "interacting with that but helping the project along for a couple of years and then at some point in late 2010 to early 2011 he disappeared so Bitcoin is a fairly unique project in how it has this kind of mythical a kind of quasi godlike founder who were just and if pops in it did the thing and if I disappeared and we've somehow just never heard from him again so in 2008 was so the white paper was the first do you know the white paper was the first time the name was actually appears that ocean oh come on leave so so how is it possible that the creator of such a impactful project remains anonymous that's a tough question and there's no similarity to it in history of technology as far as I'm aware yeah so one possibility is that it's healthy knee because healthy knee ",
        "2": "was also active in the Bitcoin community and as health any in those two beginning years and how is health any maybe I see you say one of the people at the end of early cypherpunk community he was a computer scientist computer scientists cryptographers people interested in technology internet freedom like those kinds of topics it was the correct that that rather he seemed to have been involved in either the earliest or the first transaction of Bitcoin yes the first transaction a Bick would was between Satoshi and a health inning do you think he knew who Satoshi was if she wasn't Satoshi you probably know how is it possible to work so closely with people and nevertheless not know anything about their fundamental identity it is this like a natural sort of characteristic of the internet ",
        "3": "looking forward to think about it because you and I just met no there's a there's a depth of knowledge that we now have about each other that's like physical like my vision system is able to recognize you I can also verify your identity of uniqueness like yep this like it's very hard to fake you being you yes so the Internet the Internet has a fundamentally different quality to it which is just fascinating yeah it's definitely interesting as I definitely just know a lot of people just buy their internet handles and to me when I think of them like I see their internet handles and one of them has signed of profile picture as this kind of face that's kind of not quite human with about your hand of psychedelic colors and at and when I visualize him I could just visualize that that's not an actual face yeah you are the creator of the ",
        "4": "second well he's currently the second most popular kept across e aetherium so on this topic for just stick on Satoshi Nakamoto for a little bit longer you may be the most qualified person to speak to the psychology of this anonymity that we're talking about mmm-hmm like your identity is known like we I've just verified it but from your perspective what are the benefits in creating a cryptocurrency and then remaining anonymous like if you can psychoanalyze satoshi nakamoto is there something interesting there or just a peculiar quirk of him it definitely helps create this kind of image of this a neutral thing that doesn't belong to anyone then you created a project and because you're anonymous and because you also have disappear or as unfortunately happened to help any if that is him he ended up I think dying of abou Gehrig's disease and ",
        "5": "he's in a cryogenic freezer now but like if you pop in and you'd and then you created and you're gone and all that's remaining if that whole process is the thing itself then I think no one can go and try to and if interpret any of your other behavior and try to understand like oh the like this person wrote this thing in some essay ID at age 16 where he expressed particular opinions about democracy and so because of that this project is like is a statement that's dragna's your this specific thing instead it creates this environment where the thing is what you make of it and it doesn't have the yeah right the the the burden of your are their ideas political thought and so on so so now then we're sitting with you do you feel the burden of being kind of the face of ",
        "6": "aetherium I mean there's a very large community of developers but nevertheless you know is there like a burden associated with that there definitely is this is definitely a big reason why I've been trying to kind of push for the etherium ecosystem to become more decentralized in many ways the just encouraging a lot of kind of course areum work to happen outside of the ethereum foundation and if expanding the number of people that are making different kinds of decisions having multiple software bill notations instead of one and all of these things like there's a lot of things that I've tried to do it to and we've removed myself as a single point of failure because that is something that a lot of people criticize me for so if you look at like the most fundamentally successful open source projects uh-huh it seems that it's like a sad reality when I think about it is it seems to be ",
        "7": "that one person is a crucial contributor often if you look a lioness from from for Linux for the kernel that is possible and I'm definitely not planning to disappear that's an interesting tension led projects like this kind of desire a single entity and yet they're fundamentally distributed I don't know if there's something interesting to say about that kind of structure and thinking about the future of cryptocurrency does there need to be a leader there's different kinds of leaders you know there's there's dictators who control all the money there's people who control organizations there's a kind of high priests that just have themselves have their twitter followers what kind of leader are you would you say actually a bit more in the hyper in the high priest direction than before yeah like I definitely actually ",
