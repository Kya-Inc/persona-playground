        "0": "let me ask a bit of a human question charles hoskinson someone you've worked with in the early days of ethereum their peers to my outsider view to have been a bit of a falling out is there positive inspiring human story to be told about why you two parted ways i kind of wants to let the various books about ethereum speak for themselves um but you know you know if i feel like you know since that time i think uh you know charles has that clearly i mean progressed and matured in a lot of ways and people who follow charles closely have definitely told me that you know like 2021 charles is very different from 2014 charles and i'm sure 2021 vitalik is much different from 2014 metallic as well i'm kind of interested how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and charles look like as well ",
        "1": "oh interesting like the progression of the humans is this going to be one of those things where like everyone comes full circle and then 2030 vitalik and charles are best friends yeah i mean not necessarily best friends but some kind of uh um are able to reminisce in ways that is um that puts some of the tension of the past behind i think so such things are possible um i think you know people definitely absolutely have a right to and and they should strive to just constantly change and reinvent themselves um is there something you could say about your thoughts about the cardano project that charles hoskinson leads they've worked on some interesting ideas that mirror some of the ideas in ethereum proof of stake working on smart contracts and all those kinds of things is there something again uh positive inspiring that you could say ",
        "2": "are they a competitor is it complementary technology it's uh there's definitely interesting ideas in there i mean i do think cardano takes a bit of a different approach to than ethereum and that you know they really emphasize having these big academic proofs for everything um whereas ethereum tends to be more okay with heuristic arguments and in part because it's just trying to do more faster um but you know there's definitely very interesting things that come out of you know iohk research and so is there can you comment on that kind of idea i as sort of uh having a foot in research enjoy charles's kind of emphasis on papers and like deep academic rigor is there what's the role of deep research rigor in the world of cryptocurrency interesting i'm actually the sort of person who thinks d-rigger is overrated um the reason why i think deep rigger is overrated is because i think like the the in terms of like why protocols fail i think the number of failures or that ",
        "3": "are outside the model is even more important is like bigger and more important than the failures that are inside the model right so if you take selfish mining for example like the the that original discovery from 2013 that showed how um bitcoin does like even if it has a fifty percent uh fault tolerance assuming everyone's honest it only has a yeah you know zero to thirty three percent fault tolerance depending on your network model if you assume uh rational actors and like to me that wasn't that was a great example of like an outside the model failure right because traditional consensus research just up until or before the blockchain days did not think about like incentivization much right like there was a little bit of thought about incentivization there's like a couple of papers on the byzantine altruist rational model but it wasn't that deep it was mostly operating under the assumption that you know this we're going to make consensus between 15 participants and ",
        "4": "these are institutions and if something goes wrong then you know if it was we can figure out whether or not it was deliberate offline and if they did something evil we can sue them whereas in the crypto world you can't do that right and so like that whole discovery basically arose just because like you know the model of uh traditional uh consensus research just like didn't cover those possibilities and then like once you go out of that model those that other issues do exist right um so but then at the same time like there definitely are um protocols that turn out to be insecu that do have failures inside the model like this reminds me of at the time when uh i think i found a bug in a proposed uh consensus implementation from either bitshares or eos this happened around the end of 2017. um so that was definitely inside the model because like they had a very clear idea of what they were trying to achieve they had a very clear description and like there's a very clear mathematical argument for why the description doesn't lead to what they're trying to achieve but ultimately ",
        "5": "what you're trying to achieve can never be fully described in formal language right like this is the big discovery of you know the ai safety people for example right like just having a a specification of what you want is an insanely hard problem and like the more powerful the optimizer that you're giving the instructions to the more you have to be careful and and so you know i think there are kind of these two sides and then the other thing is that a lot like a lot of the academic approach ends up like basically optimizing for other people inside of the academic system and it doesn't really optimize for like curious outsiders whereas like i personally met like totally optimized for curious outsiders or at least i feel like i strive to so i guess like that's my case for why i uh like tends to behave in ways that you know occasionally traditional academic types ",
        "6": "criticizes being reckless um but i you know on the other hand you know there's i mean there's definitely real benefits that come from like just taking us a rigorous approach especially when you know you know what the thing that ex like you know what the specification is of what you're trying to get and like you're trying to kind of improve your way or provide protocols that actually provide that like you know exactly what you're looking for i feel like realistically you probably wants to do both kinds of analysis and like sometimes even want to do both kinds of analysis and stages right like you have you want to do more quick and dirty things and you even want public feedback on the quick and dirty stuff and then later on you formalize it more and then you get more feedback um like in general i guess i feel like the norms of a research in the future like the internet has just changed so much there's no way that it's not going and you know it's it's even changed like collaboration structures and like the ",
        "7": "patterns in which we work with each other there's no way that the correct structure for club collaborative research is the same as what it was 15 years ago but like what combination of these existing components and of new ideas it is like that's something that's you know totally legitimate to kind of fight it out and i think it's great that there's different ecosystems that have different attitudes to things like you know i think you know there's a big possibility that you know things that the ethereum ways that the ethereum ecosystem approaches some problems is totally wrong and if there's other ecosystems or different principles and they can do well that's something that we can learn from you "
