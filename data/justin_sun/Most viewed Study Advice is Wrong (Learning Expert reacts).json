        "1": "bat let's say this is efficient studying and I know there are no numbers there but higher means more efficient lower means low or no efficiency and this axis we're looking at time here's what happens for the average student for her 6 o'cl in the evening after okay I'm going to let them cook don't worry but it's an interesting point the fact that there's no numbers on the axis of efficiency that is actually something that people struggle with is understanding how do you know whether you learning is more or less efficient it's actually really challenging because we don't actually have a really good concept of what efficiency is a very technical thing to try to get an understanding of efficient is not just covering more content in a shorter amount of time because learning is about what you're able to do with the knowledge so you have to actually measure your efficiency based on the quality of knowledge that you're building if for example you studied a lot you know covered a lot of content in a short period of time but you're not able to retrieve that knowledge or you can retrieve it but you can only retrieve it in a very very very simple way it wasn't actually efficient when you compare it to what you needed to do with that so there's an outcome Focus there and I teach this in my program in ",
        "2": "a lot more depth but the nutshell of this is figure out how you need to use your knowledge and then think how long does it take for me to get to the level of retention that I need for the level of knowledge that I need and then look at the total amount of time that it took to do that so that includes not just the amount of time that you spend on a single day studying but also how long does it take for you to cover all your flash cards that you need to cover as well as any practice tests and whatever like the total amount of time spent to study to reach the level of knowledge you need to retrieve and use the knowledge that you need to use it at at the level of retention that you think is optimal and desirable and necessary that will give you the information around your learning efficiency anyway moving on after her supper at The Residency dining hall she popped herself down at her little study area and started studying but here's what happened by about 6:30 she was in a major slump but what was her goal the to study 6 hours so she ",
        "3": "continued to sit at her little desk and stare at Pages until midnight she was at her desk six hours how long did she actually study about 20 30 minutes now there's a simple conduct in Psychology that all of you are aware of things that are reinforced we tend to do more of things that are punished or ignored we tend to do less of you know we operate by those principles to a large degree if you're sitting there for 6 hours are you good no once you get here you're looking at your book going I hate geography I hate literature I hate psychology all the things we're trying to get you to fall in love with you're hating it and so her actual good studying was followed by five and a half hours of pain and misery I would bet you I don't know for a fact that as the quarter progressed she sat down and finally she was done before she even started she sat down and just stared at a book and she fled every class now now had she taken this little ",
        "4": "seminar or figured things out on her own she'd know what to do first rule the moment you start to slide you're shoveling against the tide what you need to do is what take a break here's what's cool about it you can study for a half hour it doesn't take a half hour break to recharge your batteries for most people about five minutes and this is where you go away do something fun for five minutes call a friend talk to a child talk to a parent a roommate enjoy some music do something you enjoy and actually say this is my treat for having studied for 30 minutes effectively go back and here's what happens your efficiency is nearly 100% study a half hour take a break study a half hour study a half hour now had she done that over a course of six hours she would have got about 5 and a half hours of serious studying and about a half hour total break time I so overall solid advice right I can't fold it I would not dare to you know really put much vote on Mighty Lobdell cuz he's kind of like a legend honestly but it's not actually quite accurate because what you're actually refreshed on is not your efficiency it is your focus and attention which is not always the same thing thing if all it took to learn ",
        "5": "effectively was attention and focus it would actually be a relatively easy thing a lot of people can study with good focus and and good attention for a short amount of time but then their actual performance with that knowledge is not always the same again it depends on the way that you can uh retrieve that knowledge so if you've ever learned something and at the same like let's say that the teacher just explained something to you in class and you were focused and you were paying attention and you're trying to figure it out and your friend is able to figure it out and they get it and then they can explain it to you in a way that is very simple and like they've clearly understood it but you weren't able to do that it wasn't cuz you weren't paying attention it's not CU you weren't focused it's not CU you weren't you know energetic enough it's because you lacked the fundamental cognitive habits to process the information in a way that allowed you to make sense of it unpack it and consolidate it back into your network and that's a cognitive process taking a break doesn't necessarily mean you suddenly magically gain that skill it is ",
        "6": "great for rejuvenating your focus like 100% should you do this RIS timing yes I I strongly encourage it it is going to allow you to stay focused for a longer period of time 100% is that the thing that actually improves your learning efficiency only if your efficiency is mostly held back by declining focus and energy is that the case for most people probably for most people a big part of their studying efficiency is capped because their focus only lasts for 20 to 30 minutes and that will help when you do this you'll realize that's no longer a problem for you anymore if you still have difficulties and you still struggle it means that the thing that's holding you back now is something else you still improved you're still getting better but now there's just another thing and as you continue to R these barriers you just get bitter and bitter and bitter and that's the self-regulated learning ",
        "7": "game that's how you become an efficient learner let me ask you what's the primary function of a bedroom what's the secondary function good most groups go I go take py 20 225 to learn about it it's functional okay primary function of a dining T eating primary function of a living area Okay Recreation socializing right now a lot of students don't realize how much we're controlled by environmental cues a piece of research then at University of Hawaii researchers asked the students what's the biggest problem with studying they said we can't get into it the university in question had primarily dorm rooms very few computer students to the university most of you seen a dorm room oh okay most of you seen a dorm room they're usually rectangular if it's a tuplex one side bed another side of bed everything kind of mirr image study area study area right you got a closet or wardrobe so it's real interesting in one room you sleep you groom you talk with people you socialize you study you snack you're all in one room it's a multi-purpose room and yet you're supposed to study if your door is open ",
        "8": "what happens everybody hey L what's up you know and then they got to come in and talk to you very quickly you can't get to studying well the professors heard that the students couldn't get into studying but they knew what the dorms looked like in the Hawaiian dorms all of the rooms had a goose neck lamp so the professor said we're going to try a little experiment take that lamp make a little sign and put it on it study lamp Okay use it only for studying you don't dress by it you don't have BS sessions by it you don't snack by it you don't clean the room by it nothing you use the other lights for all other functions there's the way works and it's so easy everyone of you can do this get a little lamp you probably have one already if you don't my gosh yard sale garage s you pick them up for nothing get that lamp and it becomes your study lamp so if you have to study in your bedroom turn your desk away from the bed that's the like how you been to the mall it makes you want to go to sleep by the way you can't study in the bed it's also bad for your back if you know about posture turn your back to the bed have a blank wall have your lamp have your books ready to go because you can Fu away a lot of time getting ready can't you how many of you can futs and Fs yeah you're ready to go turn on the lamp and start studying the moment you lose your Edge 15 20 30 minutes later turn the ",
        "9": "lamp off get up and leave the desk what you're training yourself to study while seated there and it becomes increasingly automatic as did the raising of the hand you sit turn the lamp on and you're ready to go it's like magic the students who did that were one grade point higher the next term compared to the control group that didn't do it one grade point simply by creating a study area now if you study in the kitchen dining remove all food cues because I know what happens there you start thinking turkey in the fridge so it's a kind of a longish point there to make but it's an important point which is that yes your environment really makes a big difference to your focus and your behaviors in general and this is all kind of modern behavioral change and recommendations should really be focused on trying to change your environment and obviously it's the same for you know getting distracted by things and procrastinating a few things that I'll add onto this the principles in theory are perfectly sound like nothing really has changed too much since this talk but a lamp is great actually got a lamp right here on my disc as well that I turn on when I really need to get my focused work done but there's a few other things like having a good set of ",
        "10": "headphones that you know like a Bluetooth like noise cancelling headphones there's a very specific app that I personally use to create like white noise and block out those types of distractions I think it's just called White Noise light or something White Noise light or White Noise app or something like that and so that's just an app that I'll use to create kind of like a auditory focus zone if you do study in your bedroom do not study in your bed like you know Maria is saying it's honestly a really really bad thing to do and I know a lot of people do I know it's comfortable but that's not the point like it's going to ruin your sleep and it's going to ruin your studying like once you start ruining your sleep and your study simultaneously by studying in bed it's such an uphill battle to try to fight against that so don't do that turn your desk away from the bed another thing that you can try to find is like screen dividers or dressing room dividers they're basically these like fold out kind of panels and you can pick them up off like you know like Amazon or somewhere for like 5 10 bucks and you can just stick them against the wall when you're not using them but then when you do need to use ",
        "11": "them you put them behind your desk like behind your chair to create almost like a little cubicle of focus for yourself and you can have your you know your lamp on your headphones on and it creates a really really really great like focused environment what I used to do is I used to also put kind of old blankets over the dividers as well so it actually creates like a thick like more soundproof wall anyway these are some of the things that you can do but you want to try to manipulate and change that environment as much as possible as you can see obviously here like this is my office this is my space I do not recreate at all in this area like this is an area I use only for work and study if I'm just chilling I'll take my laptop and I'll take it upstairs if I want to play games like I've got a PlayStation I bought a PlayStation because I do not want to actually play games on my you know MacBook or my desktop or whatever it is like I want to have a dedicated space and a dedicated console for just like chilling out and playing games few little tips yeah swiss cheese in the fridge oh yeah sand when you're reading ",
        "12": "it over and over or saying it over and over the term for that is rote memorization spelled r o te it can work it is the way most of us were taught in elementary school the way I understand it a lot of Asian schools depend heavily on rote and some of you may be darn good at it and if you can memorize and actually understand by repetition and it's effective for you don't change but for most of us it's not the most efficient or effective way I would argue just you should still change there just there's no benefit the way to learn efficiently in college first you have to decide what am I learning is it a concept or wait so just one one thing is that most people don't know how to know if they understand something and this is the problem with a lot of like speed reading techniques is that they say ah not only am I increasing my reading speed but my comprehension is also really high how do you even measure your comprehension what does comprehension even mean you got to understand that when you test someone's comprehension we say that word as if it means something else but it's not it is actually just learning and it is incredibly difficult to test someone's learning at all the ",
        "13": "different levels that you need to test it at a lot of these you know techniques they say I'm going to double or triple your reading speed and then your comprehension is going to be 80 90 you know 100% and the way that they're testing the comprehension is just like literal like hug fact recall and it's like to be honest that is the least important type of comprehension to even test on so there's an issue is that if you are relying a lot on these like rot memorization repetitive strategies then you're probably not even aware that you need to test your understanding of that knowledge at different levels of complexity as well and if you are doing that then you're probably not using this method because you'd realize how limited it is fact a fact is the discreet little piece of information Sigman Freud is the father of psychoanalysis that's a fact okay but understanding what psychoanalysis is is a concept okay understanding the name of a bone is a fact understanding what it does in the body gets into a concept okay so in studying sometimes there are a lot of ",
        "14": "facts in fact I use Anatomy as a good example you got to memorize bones muscles organs tissues a lot of it but if you simply memorize and don't understand the function of it the comprehension of the actual Concepts it's a lot of wasted learning really just to know a name of a bone is like yes so what okay what does it do how does it function so if it's a or a fact toid you have to approach it one way and I'll talk about how you do that but in most college classes what we as professors are most concerned about is that you grasp the concept because Concepts once grasped will stay with you lifetime facts can easily get confused but that's why we have Google why we have reference books if you know the concept you can quickly look up the fact if you have to know that for particular fact neat thing is I get questions who has more Advantage younger students or older students depends on what you're talking about most of us as we get older realize concepts are what are really important to make our lives better to be effective in our work to be effective in our personal lives facts though we realize we can look up we can get those if we need them young people actually often learn facts very quickly but they never think about the concept ccept I'll give you a simple example I'm an old guy ",
        "15": "okay so I do have some things that respectfully I want to call out and point out about what Mar LEL has just said here first of all it is an oversimplification to think about learning as either facts versus Concepts and you know the research on this was been out for like since 1999 and in 2001 then it was reviewed again 2007 so like by the time this talk was made there was enough research around this to kind of not oversimplify it to this point it's it's a different thing to know a fact it's a different thing to know concept and I agree completely with everything that he's talking about in terms of the fact that facts really aren't as important but then there's another thing in terms of how you are able to use those facts and how you're able to use those Concepts and whether the way that you understand it is the same way that you would use it and then how those different facts and Concepts relate to each other and that's actually where the the peak knowledge is and probably if you know might L ever watches this video which I doubt he ever will but he probably knows that like intuitively that it's not just the understanding of the concept it's the understanding and the implication of that concept and its impact that it has on other Concepts and ",
        "16": "that's what true expertise and Mastery is which I'm sure he already knows but he just doesn't explain it that way now the difficult part is that when especially for he talks about how young people really focus on facts a lot it's a lot of that is because a lot of Assessments really emphasize these facts and a lot of teachers actually tell people to memorize facts so young people are kind of like LED astray by a lot of bad advice and by what apparently is important which is apparently I should learn all these facts because clearly that's the way that I'm tested on it the skill is about being able to learn all your facts without sacrificing the ability to gain the true exper te and indeed as you get older especially Beyond uni and you know Advanced like postgraduate degrees the facts really do become very very non-important to the point where you can kind of just skim over most of those facts here we go I'm going to read to you 13 letters from our ",
        "17": "alphabet you all know the alphabet right should be meaningful as soon as I finish I want you to say them back to me in the same sequence that I give them to you so I'll say them and I'll go like that just say them back y t h don't write them a u s p d p a y h boy somebody sounded like they got quite remember and I sit in front of classes where they go for 50 minutes I'm giving them wisdom and they're not taking a damn note and then they wonder why they don't remember you can't remember everything in a lecture I'm going to rearrange the letters a little bit see if you do any better r s most of you got all 13 and you thought coming to this lecture you might gain nothing expanded to 13 did you give them again what are they damn you're good or I'm good now obviously it was a little easier those were the same 13 letters same ones if you're studying anything conceptual and you're trying to memorize it it's like ytr it doesn't make any sense it's in one eye out the other if it's out loud ",
        "18": "one ear out the other but if you take the time to discover the meaning in it suddenly it clicks and I could probably ask you next week what were those 13 letters and most of you tell me at the end of the quarter I could ask you most of you could tell me you might be confused was it happy Wednesday or Thursday but you'd guess probably Thursday now some of you are in my intro class this quarter I do something that I wish I had time to do I divide the class in two using a card so half reads one the other half reads another card I have one group try to estimate the number of vowels in a series of words that I read to them so they're thinking about the words we'd say that's superficial thinking how many vowels in mosquito how many vowels in Bottle how many vowels in elephant and they get to write down what they think is a number of vowels the second group are instructed they're told you need to think about how valuable this item would be if you were stranded on a deserted island and you then rate its value on a fivepoint scale one being no value five being highly valuable that's called deeper processing you're now thinking about it in terms of its application or use by the way I always think elephant is a fun one I'd give it a five okay not only company but if you got really hungry you got a lot of food there right right I then read I think ",
        "19": "it's about 30 words everybody's writing down their numbers I then have them do a stalling exercise where they write their name phone number and address that's to dump short-term memory because they might be thinking about the words I just read if you're now writing your name and address it changes your focus short-term memory only lasts about 20 to 30 seconds it's pretty brief so I count it on the clock after 30 seconds I say now write down as many words that you can recall this one is so powerful the group that's counting vowels on average remembers five out of about 30 words time time again the group that's thinking about the usefulness on a deserted island remembers 10 okay it's slightly more 55 5.5 versus 10.5 but very close to a doubling without doing any more effort simply by thinking about it instead of just cying to superficially think about it this okay really important points here interesting he says not without any more effort because it is actually more cognitive effort and actually that's the point so like he sort of actually contradicted himself I think unintentionally because he said before like trying to create meaning is one of the biggest struggles of learning and then now he sort of talks about the fact ",
        "20": "that it doesn't take effort but that that is the effort so the second activity which is about assigning value to something that is one of the most important things to do in learning and you'll see this principle come up in my videos constantly which is that an effective technique isn't just about finding relationships and comparing things to each other you have to actually make a value judgment about how important it is that forces you to prioritize and that is the higher order learning that I always talk about when you're making a value judgment you have to then think about it in relation to other things in relation to a context in relation to a bigger picture it forces it to be not only part of a network but to understand its position and strength within that Network you know it's a great demonstration of this particular activity but it does take more mental effort than the superficial learning usually does especially when you're studying complex Concepts over a long period of time it is more mental effort and the problem is that people don't know that it's meant to take more effort e and that effort is good for you and so ",
        "21": "they kind of avoid that and that's what I again something that I talk about very often which is a misinterpreted effort hypothesis so the other thing is that he talked about how you know he had the letters you know like happy Thursday and uh it was like you know what are the letters and how you trying to memorize them a really interesting analogy that we can draw from that which is completely like relevant for the real world is that when you learn something in a curriculum there is an assumption that the order in which your presented information is a good order for you to learn it in and it is usually not and and you actually have to understand that the order that is best for you and for your brain is probably going to be different to the order it was presented to you or the way that is in a textbook or something like that and reordering information is a crucial part of learning effectively to figure out what is happy Thursday because what makes sense in this case happy Thursday everyone understands that it makes sense for everyone everyone is has the right ",
        "22": "order that makes it easier for them but for knowledge that's not the case because what makes sense for you for knowledge depends on what you already know so the right order that makes the most sense for you is going to be different sometimes to what makes sense for another person and so figuring out your best order also takes time and thinking about why is this valuable how important is it that is a great question to ask yourself when you're studying to help you figure out what is the right order because you want to learn the things that you think are the most important and make the most sense and are the most logical and intuitive and you want to continue to chain that together this is where as a student the more you get into the understanding the better now this raises a fun question what is the meaning of meaning if I say something is Meaningful or meaningless what am I really saying I'm not going to go through a big drill which is kind of fun of teasing it out of you but a meaningful piece is a piece that relates to something you already know and the best little analogy is it's it's like a file system that you've already got established you add a new entry to it so ",
        "23": "it's all neatly organized and it's very easy if you've got a file system to add a new entry we do with computers also almost good analogy because the file system I would recommend not thinking about your memory like a filing system because a filing system suggests that knowledge can only exist in one cabinet and that those cabinets are separate from each other I would encourage people to think about it a little bit more like like a jigsaw puzzle that you're trying to build each piece of the puzzle fits somewhere and it belongs somewhere and to find it let's say you want to find the piece related to a particular cloud in the sky in your jigsaw puzzle you know where to find that because you know that clouds are in the sky which tends to be higher up on the puzzle and you know the clouds are in the left corner that's where you look for it so you can retrieve it CU you know where it is but it's position is relative to all the other positions and it's not necessarily like you can categorize that however you want to categorize it and it's not like ",
        "24": "a fixed isolated kind of thing like a filing system is the other way as a teacher I think all of us as we are teachers we all try to make things meaningful in our classes so we give stories we give examples but sometimes our examples don't work for you this is where you have to tease it out so I'm going to go to a couple things to help you there first study groups We underutilize Them especially Community College would people get through med school without study groups not very many uh do we have vet tech back there dental hygiene Tech pretty sophisticated stuff they have to learn right do they do study groups no oh my I would hope they do I would encourage them to do it where I've got students to form study groups performance of the groups go up dramatically now part of it is probably because they're motivated to do that so it's a bit confounded but I'm convinced there's also the power of studying with other people I know these Concepts in Psych so well I can't see how they're confusing but another student who's just found the answer can sometimes turn say Thursday here's what it's about and you go ah is that what Mr Lobdell was saying God so easy but I can't do that because I don't see where the problems lie in that particular concept study groups are ",
        "25": "great okay I'm not going to tell you how many of you totally hurt yourself in studying I like kind of agree but also kind of a disagree with that study groups can be helpful but also study groups can be a waste of time as well if you're not using them correctly I don't know if I've got a video on my Channel about that but if I don't I I will make another one talking a little bit more about how to extract the most out of study groups I see a lot of people use study groups kind of like an excuse to not study you know they're trying to make study groups so that studying becomes easier but you can't really avoid the mental effort involved in learning properly the study group should actually enhance your ability to face the difficulties of learning more productively not kind of create an illusion that you're learning because you're having some conversations with people the other thing is also just because someone explain something to you in a way that makes sense doesn't mean that you can then create that explanation yourself when you need to and this is the an illusion of learning as well in fact you already probably know this that just because someone explained something to you in makes sense when they explain it doesn't mean that you can create that explanation ",
        "26": "otherwise studying would honestly be really easy as soon as you understand anything you would just remember it and be able to retrieve it in fact that's kind of the easy part of studying the difficult part of studying is the process from going from understanding to being able to retrieve from memory at different levels of complexity so it's not really as simple as that if you magic mark highlight whatever you call it your textbooks the little yellow pink green glow-in-the-dark sort of thing how many of you use the mark those were invented in 65 year I started college so I bought one I turned entire books ugly orange then I figured it out if You' color page solid orange you've actually highlighted nothing yeah by highlighting everything you've really highlighted zip so I did the clever thing and you guys are way ahead of me what do you highlight folks the most important thing when do you do it when you first read the book right or the chapter so you read through are you studying no I'm reading for the most important things Z and some of you get out rulers to make it really neat take hours to make pretty little then you go back to the start of the chapter you ",
        "27": "read the first thing you underlined and you go I remember that no you don't you recognize it people are incredible at confusing recognition with recollection your visual recognition threshold is so great you could see a person once see them years later go I know you were you a student at Pierce College yeah did you take psych yeah from lob yeah 36 years I run into that okay proof of this grab a magazine in your house that you haven't looked at for a while leave through it you will get the illusion of remembering virtually every advertisement and article but to prove that it's not recollection it's actually you know it's really simple to prove this it's like you can take like a dollar bill or you know your local currency and if someone shows it to you you can see it and you can recognize it immediately but if you wanted to draw it very very few people would know it well enough to actually draw what a dollar bill looks like accurately even if you've seen it thousands of times in your life and this is the case for most of the things that we you know have in our in our life that we can recognize you could have you know like your phone you've got your phone in your hand and ",
