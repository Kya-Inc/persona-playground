        "0": "I really don't want to start this video off by saying I told you so but let's get into it [Music] okay so today I want to talk about what has been happening the most recent developments of steam steam it and Justin Sun who is that one guy that one loud guy behind Tron so what had happened was rumors flying about of Justin's son acquiring steam it Inc which is the company that helps you know develop and promote the steam blockchain and steam it dot-com essentially which is the blogging platform one of the very first decentralized social media efforts definitely one of the most popular yet ",
        "1": "at least most widely used in my to my knowledge a decentralized media platform where I myself pretty much started this whole thing gaining an audience getting used to blogging a lot talking about my travels is definitely how it started off but steam it calm was essential for him getting involved learning from people and getting used to being in front of the camera really it's what inspired my creation of this YouTube channel that is crypto tips but definitely want to give credit where credit is due when it comes to my cryptocurrency origin story and for me that was steam it so it's really unfortunate to see this go down but like I said before I don't want to say I told you so because quite frankly I've said it a lot of times about this delegated proof of state consensus algorithm where you have a set limited number of witnesses or a number of people who are able to make changes on the blockchain ",
        "2": "and essentially control that blockchain a lot of proponents of DPOs say it allows for streamlining acquiring consensus letting hard Forks and changes necessary changes to the blockchain happen quickly but again it limits the amount of who can participate really in the network or at least who can get paid for it and when it comes to wanting to take over that blockchain it definitely cuts that number compared to a much more decentralized network it cuts a number to much more manageable number so the Sun is going down on me but I wanted to get this video out and let you know what's happening because especially regarding my recent video where I was talking about is it possible to take over Bitcoin essentially no because it is far too expensive and pretty much no and what we're seeing here with Steam blockchain although this is directly involving steam it Inc it is involving ",
        "3": "witnesses and that is the governance model for the steam blockchain so although steam it com is one application on that blockchain there are many other apps on the steam blockchain but because Justin son had his eyes on steam it calm or steaming ink he also gained access to the entire blockchain essentially through his work with witnesses so what had happened was Justin's son acquired steam and ink and with that he would also get gained access to a large amount of pre mined coins now the previous owners of steam at inc ned scott dam Larimer before they pretty much had a spoken-- agreement with the witnesses that they would only use those pre mined tokens to help fund community development not to use that stake to vote for witnesses or to vote on content and essentially be a huge gatekeeper for ",
        "4": "information and control a lot of how the blockchain works so now that they sold out to Justin Sun a lot of the witnesses were scared of what he would do with that large stake of pre mined coins because it was a spoken agreement I and a trust a whole lot of trust going on there with the previous CEO of steaming Inc and it was not in a contract certainly not in a smart contract so I you know of course it is in Justin Suns best interest monetary interest to gain access to that stake but the witness is wanting to try to protect the integrity of the blockchain and try to keep it as normal as possible as in the past they issued a soft fork which would essentially freeze steam and ynx steak without so essentially not allowing them to spend those coins however they want I'm gonna share with you a article an article that was ",
        "5": "written by the steam it blog on steam accom and the owner of this account is Justin Sun or you know in his in his team now because they're the ones who run steam in ink it was deleted it's since been deleted but thank you to someone who archived it I've got access Brady Dale I'm looking at you thank you for that link sharing it here I think it's definitely important to share because it is it gives you just a peek into how Tron or Justin Sun wants to frame this whole situation I will be posting a link to this archived blog post since been deleted down below in the video description for those of you who are concerned about steam or steam it and you want to understand where Justin's son is coming from how he's trying to twist this definitely check out that link so you can read this blog post for yourself and should come as no surprise that a lot of the very original ",
        "6": "members of steam it like Roland and and many others have had loud voices in the comments down below of how they feel about this whole situation so basically what has happened is a lot of people this situation with steam is a perfect example of all of the ways a blockchain and how people participate in their investments of the coins for that blockchain can be done in all the wrong ways and it can lead to one megalomaniac wanting to take control and half power and do whatever he wants with it so so this is gonna be something definitely is still in in development we're gonna see how how it pans out for Tron and first steam it and for the steam blockchain but so he calls the soft fork 22.2 which was the initial efforts by this ",
        "7": "team original steam witnesses to freeze steam and ink away from those pre mine coins he calls it maliciously structured and tending to freeze a handful of very targeted accounts and taking away their rights and possession - they're owned account owned assets and may be deemed illegal and criminal gulp is he going to be pressing charges because a lot of these witnesses although they have the ability to be anonymous I'm sure a lot of them actually have their identifying information pretty well known so man anonymity decentralization and owning your own coins not storing them on an exchange these are the lessons hopefully to be learned by those participating on Steam accom so what happened how was Justin Sun able to overpower this soft Fork and gain access to these pre mined coins and what is he going to do about ",
        "8": "it he was able to work with his friends on centralized exchanges to use the amount of steam tokens that were being stored on those centralized exchanges by many different individuals who had invested in steam and chose to store those coins on these centralized exchanges hmm what do exchanges do that are very similar to what banks do they tend to take your investments because they have the rights to them because they hold the private keys not you and anyone had took that investment and used it to their benefit by becoming witnesses on the steam blockchain so because so many people stored their steam tokens on exchanges these several different exchanges had the ability to have enough weight to become witnesses and pretty much overpower the the original witnesses and ",
        "9": "again it is only because the Steam blockchain is delegated proof of stake that even allowed this to happen it allowed it definitely Shrunk the the amount of witnesses needed to overtake to pretty much control the blockchain now the the wording again in this blog post by the steam by the steam it blog is kind of scary yeah what does it say okay there is a lot of hypocrisy and a lot of irony here for those of you who can put two and two together and remember what is important this is something why I'm preaching always on this channel and for those of you who have been subscribed for a while who've watched my videos for a while I think that that I mean not to toot my own horn here but I think it's gonna be paying off for you if you have it ingrained in your head to pay ",
        "10": "attention to things that are centralized how things are organized centrally I said it so many times centralization can come in many different forms I mean it's pretty obvious here with delegated proof of stake but you have to be able to not get sucked in to this tribalism to see a project for what it is yes you can certainly be excited about it you can participate in the community but have your eyes open and don't don't shut yourself to the truth because it could definitely affect your investments in the long run of those projects yes many of these projects can actually get away with really poor organization and not actually having a working product and when it comes to it as an investment because this space is so incredibly speculative I mean Tron for one hello if you ever needed an example that if you ever needed an example of a bot run platform and DAPs and you know whoever's participating it it's not it's not like ",
        "11": "six hundred million or whatever he was trying to claim it it's 600 million BOTS in a bot form and he was hired probably in India or China some are sure but not real people let's be real here but let's get back to ok here's a scary comment that he said commitment to the community the steam blockchain will not be abandoned or merge to Tron unless the community decides so which right now the community is Justin son and the centralized exchanges now for the next four to six weeks the steamin team will be using the voting rights to resume the order of the community to resume the order of the community while having an open channel for meeting community members and witnesses the goal is to protect the steam blockchain from bad actors add transparency and receive community suggestions and advice after the four to six weeks period the steam a team will give the government's will give the governance back to the community when it's back in order and mutual agreement ",
        "12": "so Justin is saying for the sake of decentralization he's gonna go ahead and take all the power and wait until everyone is okay with playing by his rules and then once they agree to that irreverence and you know on the same page then he'll go ahead and give the power back that sounds like exactly what Satoshi wanted for this blockchain space man so and then he goes on to say you know everything that they're planning to do to help help steam it here for example Roland Roland on Steam it great guy who always organizes a steam meetups but he says this do you do you understand this exactly what we wanted to prevent this with this move you literally killed steam used customer funds called your friends at exchanges and without customer knowing using funds residing on exchanges to power up and vote and he also for centralized a steam ",
        "13": "chain centralized it even more it was already pretty centralized so talk about if you could take down Bitcoin and my thoughts on how it's counterproductive to do that because by doing that you are essentially going to drive the price down of the coin that you're trying to control and essentially making it worthless to you and to everyone because this is a free market and people are definitely free to move from one coin to the next steam it is great it's definitely one of the biggest and most used decentralized social media platforms that we have at this space but it's not the only one maybe this is going to be what what sends all hopefully it sends a lot of people away from steam it away from Justin Sun and his crazy interest in centralization and control and trustfulness but it's really unfortunate again it's like so many of these of ",
        "14": "these people comment saying I've had Congress I've met them in person I've seen them I known them for over four years and it is really sad to see something like this happen again I haven't very skeptical of DPOs and maybe I haven't spoken out about it as much as I should have I definitely mentioned it many times in my videos saying that it's I'm not the biggest fan of it but this is a perfect example of how those kind of principles matter and how paying attention to those principles will save you in the long run so that being said I will continue to preach the good word of decentralization the importance of it because as things continue to develop things will be tested and things that are centralized that by other people will want to control if it is centralized that is one hell of a weak point so keep your eyes out stay vigilant we'll keep keep an eye out on how this steam thing steam it ink and ",
        "15": "all that drama plays out but yeah it's pretty unfortunate I just want to keep you guys in the loop and that's what we're working with right now this is definitely a quick put together a video just happened today or I got news of it today so let me know what you guys think in the comments down below in the meantime I'll be coming to you guys again soon until then have a good one [Music] [Music] "
