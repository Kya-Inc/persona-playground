        "0": "[Music] welcome everyone to this new episode of the money movement i'm really excited to be joined here today by justin sun entrepreneur uh investor diplomat uh and uh we're gonna we're gonna talk more about uh a lot of different things welcome justin it's really nice to see you yes thank you thank you jeremy longham no c yeah long time no see um i understand um you're you're uh you're dialing in uh from geneva uh with your new post uh which i want to come back to but uh i i think it's fascinating um and i and i'm always interested because i think um certainly for myself uh you know my own interest in crypto um comes out of my original interest in like political and economic systems and and and the relationship i think ",
        "1": "that this technology has to the future of how economies work um that's why i'm working on this um and and so i'm i know there has to be a a long thread that connects all these things for you so maybe i want to start maybe at the beginning of the thread not when you're born but uh maybe maybe start uh you know earlier on um i i happen to know that i believe you you you you study history yeah uh in in a prominent university in china but maybe um set the stage a little for us justin for kind of what you were thinking about um at that point in your life um and and the big themes that that were capturing your attention yes definitely um so uh i born in china so it's a very um a small province called qinghai province ",
        "2": "uh i think it's kind of like u.s i mean counterparties i think should be uh alabama you know those like midwest states you know i was from the midwest yeah very very from like very far from like new york city uh san francisco um so so basically um uh and then um my dad and mom like moved to guangdong province which is uh uh uh i i think it's like california in united states yeah well no it's like very similar to california it has the biggest gdp uh in china and also um uh it has lots of the uh innovation uh tax on there just like silicon valley right shenzhen like guangzhou right has tencent huawei like all the very big companies and then uh and then when i'm basically uh went ",
        "3": "to university i went to picken university uh which is the basketball like the harvard of uh china so yes exactly yeah however in china so i happen to get a chance to uh win into like like new york like boston right so and after after that after graduating i applied for um for my master what were you what were you what were you studying in picking university uh i think literature and history literature and history okay and and like any particular part of history chinese history world history oh yes i think it's uh modern chinese history so that's like um from this part i also study lots of like u.s uh history as well because as we know at that time like china and the us is the best allies right so they fight like ",
        "4": "silent japanese war uh so so so basically uh um lots of history uh heavily like related to like us policies so so that's that's where i'm like focused on so i think my cece's master cc's and uh also my bachelor's disease is all talking about like the ambassadorship of khush which at that time is the chinese ambassador in united states so yeah we talked a lot about during during world war ii exactly exactly yeah yeah yeah most people don't know the history yeah most americans don't know the history of the deep strategic alliance between china and the us fighting world war ii and uh i uh i i happen to know a lot from douglas about it who also studied a lot of those things uh okay so that was your thesis all right very interesting yes so that's why ",
        "5": "i know a lot of about like us policy like 50 years ago right when like roosevelt and truman is is in charge so okay and then you went to i i interrupted you i'm sorry you when i applied for master's degree uh um in united states i got admission from colombia stanford and upenn i went to upenn i decided i went to japan i think the only reason is because at that time i still want to study literature and history uh if i'm gonna doing business i think stanford will be the best choice right because it's uh in california near silicon valley um but at that time i still want to focus on uh east asia history um because jupiter is the best um yeah if you went to like upend uh you can check the museum there they ",
        "6": "actually have lots of asian like chinese uh art basically in upend museum so they spend a lot of money trying to collect like chinese collection um so back back up so that's why i um basically uh uh went to upenn so um so and also a year after i went to japan i went to europe in 2011 around 2012 uh i happened to just read like new york times and get to know bitcoin so around 2012 yeah so so that's like how i know crypto how i know bitcoin and and because bitcoin is so fascinating so it's basically psycho all my time so i have no no time to prepare for this no no time prepared for like the um uh the law school test you know so basically i think ",
        "7": "knowing bitcoin changed my whole life yeah before that i'm very academic you know uh try to like study the final american relationship in like 1940 some something like that yeah wow okay so that that was a hard pivot um exactly yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean i i we all have stories like that right i think um i was uh i had just taken a company public uh my last company brightcove yeah in in 2012 yes and later in 2012 got introduced to crypto and bitcoin yeah and it was just like you know yeah and by early you know by early 2013 i i it was like the same thing like i could i couldn't stop uh you know thinking about it and uh and and uh ",
        "8": "no but it was interesting i i had a little bit of distance between um uh my grad graduating from school and and then uh so i guess i'm a little older than you but uh uh but it was interesting is that the there were these kind of connections to um you know how is the world gonna work and i had been studying how's the world how does the world work how has it worked with politically economic systems and then seeing you know seeing crypto as a as a as a technology that could change like social structures economic structures other other things really profoundly um i'm i'm interested to hear you talk a little bit about you know as as you um as you got into it um there's obviously a lot of interest in this from the perspective of investing and stored value and trading ",
        "9": "and and and i know you're you're very successful in in those in those areas but less from that perspective and more from the perspective of you know what did you see um when you saw what bitcoin represented especially as someone who had the experience of china and the us and sort of thinking about that as a technology of economic freedom what did that mean to you yes so basically when i first like know about bitcoin i think uh the most like fascinating scenes to me is uh bitcoin it's the money for the internet right so uh i think before that uh um facebook go ipo in u.s right so grow like very big company i think there is everybody knows like internet is a big thing but still uh if you compare like internet is like what matters we are talking about today right um but still ",
        "10": "um the biggest problem for internet is there's no like currency uh on internet itself so i think that's like basically the um the biggest uh biggest uh i think important part of bitcoin when i first like think about bitcoin but i think bitcoin is just like uh um it's a start of the um internet for money era right yeah because we have seen uh these like past nine years a lot of the role bitcoin play has been basically uh uh um replaced by like other stable coin right layer one layer two solution right so i can like give you some example like when we first get into bitcoin bitcoin play a lot of row so so basically uh uh bitcoin is like the uh uh quote currency right so every coins ",
        "11": "needs to trade with bitcoin right today basically i think stable coin has take this role and also before that like bitcoin like everybody uh is thinking about like bitcoin can do like remittance uh payment these kinds of things but these days i think usdt on trunk right usdc antra has started to play play this role and also we have seen like bitcoin uh it is basically a very uh good um platform for people to build out right and right now we finding out like um more and more people building our like serum tron like other like layer one solutions um so and bitcoin i think is more and more becoming basic a store of value right so people use it just like using gold which i think is is is a is good for bitcoin because uh uh eventually all the ",
        "12": "roles needs to be played by like other better solutions right and the bitcoin find out um the biggest uh advantage of bitcoin is just like storage of value so that that's why i'm kind of against some of the idea of like turning turning bitcoin to smart contract platform and doing all the things my contract platform is doing for bitcoin because bitcoin has sacrificed this kind of the uh complexity for securities right so i think what bitcoin is doing right now is is perfect so right it still needs to continue to play this role for the storage for um basically it's the value of storage for internet yeah i mean yeah i mean it is what's so interesting is um the the role of any given technology like this uh you know some people say uh you know ",
        "13": "something like bitcoin is apolitical meaning it doesn't have it doesn't express any politics which i don't agree with um i i think it's very political i think the economic philosophy behind it is political it's austrian economic philosophy it has a very specific statement about scarcity and the value of scarcity and and the role that should play in terms of fiscal discipline and so that's a philosophy that's a political and economic philosophy for for organization but it was interesting is that you know the choi there was a choice that got made in you know really it was like 2014 2015 um when there were a lot of early developers who were coming into the space i would count circle as one of those and there were thousands of others right and you were getting involved other people ",
        "14": "getting involved and and saying you know we want to build other things on top of this like the idea is that this is like a new um infrastructure that can be used for all kinds of things and when we started we had actually thought okay bitcoin it's the first mover it's uh it's got the open source developer traction like that's where the action is that's where smart contracts will come that's where issuing assets or tokens will come but there was like a political battle there's an ideological battle that was taking place to say no bitcoin needs to do this not just one thing but basically do this one thing yeah and these other ideas you don't you shouldn't use a blockchain for them or at least that was what the you know some of the community was was arguing so that led to the development of like ",
        "15": "these new blockchains that could do more and now i think you know if you just watch cnbc you'd think everything is just like some kind of digital currency you're trading but in reality right it's infrastructure and it's like infrastructure to build things on and you know there were all these ideas of course vitalik was i think uh one of the most prominent you know creators in terms of of new ideas but then there were like 10 new blockchains right and tron was one of those that emerged and there were a lot of ideas people were looking at and saying okay that's a good idea that's a good idea i don't know how many forks of bitcoin there were there were a lot you know and it's part of this is open source and and and people competing with ideas and competing for developers and ",
        "16": "um i guess um knowing that you know you know bitcoin sort of has positioned itself as like the store of value um you know what do you see as the range of applications that will get built on these other layer ones uh or layer layer twos and maybe you could talk a little bit about what's built on tron today just as as an example of that yes uh first of all i completely agree with you i think bitcoin itself and the cryptocurrency itself is very uh political even uh it is pure like a technology right so i think that's like the difference between like ai and the uh cryptocurrency uh so basically ai like other like metaverse uh this kind of the um technology is pure technology without like any political statement ",
        "17": "but blockchain uh cryptocurrency is very political because it's represent the economic like freedom right so it's kind of like represent like hayek this kind of the uh competing currency theory you know so because uh cryptocurrency is highly related to like finance uh which definitely a very important part of um of the political power so so that's why um so basically i think uh uh uh it gets into like very political basically so that's why uh i think even the technology itself is pure technology right so it's just yeah crypto uh uh uh graphic right it's uh it's just like uh about like merkel trees it is about all the technical uh but it's interesting is that the the the the ",
        "18": "the parts of society if you go back five thousand years parts of society that had the best math yes were oftentimes the most powerful parts of society and therefore determined ways in which you know wealth and power and decisions and other things were made you know the kings who had the best mathematicians i mean you know so at one level it is just technology right but it's really the the most advanced application of uh of the ability to to do math um in some ways right and and uh you know even the yeah i mean there's so much so much history uh to to just cryptography uh math and cryptography but anyway that's a bit of a uh tangent but coming back to to your answer on on on what's being built yeah i totally agree with you uh i think most of the prominent technology ",
        "19": "in the world is a political statement so basically uh in asia china we also have these debates you know when china first defeated by britain in open world first opium war there is a huge debate inside of the china whether we should like adopt the british technology or we're gonna adopt their basically uh political system and the technology like together because like somebody is making statements it's like um like we sell like today right technology it's not only technology it's if you really want to build the best technology in the world you need to have the same political system right so which brings those technology in the first place so so that's why i think uh um basically bitcoin cryptocurrency comes along with a open finance system right so you can't have like a super control like over ",
        "20": "cryptocurrency or control uh system and then have a very uh uh prosper like like criminal ecosystem right yeah yeah yeah yeah so with with um with the evolution of of the technology obviously you you you undertook uh and and worked to build tron blockchain and and now you know i think there are tons of projects now that that you're involved with um or or that are built out around what you're doing what's the state of the of the ecosystem today yes sure um i think definitely one of the scenes we are right now focusing on is stable coin right so we collaborate also with usdc uh i think we already see a lot of user case of stablecoin so uh people right now is using uh usdc usdt ",
        "21": "on qsd like usdj or on trump blockchain as a way of like payment settle between different exchanges pay employees salaries um basically all the uh us dollar is doing yeah you can settle it on trial network uh we are settled right now every day more than uh uh 10 billion dollars someday if we settle more is uh even about like 20 billion dollars someday like um but the average i think is 12 billion dollars uh which is already like six times then paypal is doing so that's like one of our vision is making tron become the next generation of the global settlement layer for like all the stable coin or even like fiat right so in the future yeah when i first like uh before i joined crypto i worked for repo ",
        "22": "for um for for some time when i first joined ripple this is kind of like xr that was the idea right right right exactly yeah i mean when when we started circle uh you know we we we we thought the the real the real game would be if you could get a digital currency representation of a dollar or a euro or and and just do do those on these public networks and yeah well you couldn't do it technically yes so i don't know if you remember but the first the first version of circles products basically would take dollars or pounds convert them into bitcoin instantly and then you use bitcoin network sort of like converting into xrp you know but conv but we were like well bitcoin is going to be the most liquid yes because it'll be the most liquid you'll be able to do like real-time fx and but even that was still a problem but we we needed we needed tokens and smart contracts we needed the building blocks for protocols and ",
        "23": "and um but uh uh yeah and it's fascinating it is fascinating exactly so i think the like like uh like repo has the same concept right just convert the money to xrp send the xrp and convert back they have kind of the gateway system yeah so uh i think right now i think the biggest uh we have already seen numerous of the increase of the industry itself i think probably next year right i'm hoping like all the stable coin settlement on trial network can easily like pass a hundred billion dollars right so which make these like the the only solution for all the banks uh uh cryptocurrency provider and uh basically everybody in the world so uh it's a instant uh transaction uh with almost zero on transaction fees you know uh i i think this is gonna really like benefits the not only financial system ",
        "24": "crypto industry but also everybody in the world yeah and we're we very much share that share that vision um and yeah we we've been very focused on making sure that usdc can work on you know blockchains that have tons of use and distribution and reach um it's been amazing to watch what you've been able to do with um with stable coins on uh on tron so we're uh you know we're excited to see that grow um yeah i guess you know maybe looking forward a little bit um you know some of the bigger themes that everyone is talking about um you know are things like games other other categories of applications what you know the the big discussion is you know what are the apps that are going to bring a billion users onto blockchains um and a lot of people argue that games ",
        "25": "will be uh you know the you know the the kind of games and social right these kinds of apps which are the kinds of apps that have driven consumer internet behavior i mean it was like farmville that grew facebook uh originally uh you know one of the big things that helped grow facebook um and um and i'm i'm interested i mean you've made you were very early actually in making a lot of big bets on games content entertainment as like big drivers of the adoption of blockchains i think um you've made a lot of bets in that space um i'm i'm interested to hear your view on what you're seeing with blockchain gaming social tokens what are the things that are going to be um you know real really driving and i know like animoka and ygg and all these phenomena in asia are like i don't think people realize ",
        "26": "in the west how big these phenomenon uh are right now exactly um i i definitely agree with you i believe social and games is the next um basically driving force for all the um blockchain applications uh i can give you some examples so we uh recently launched a game called wing another horse uh which probably the uh one of the first like play to earn games just like alexey um we we get like numerous attraction of the game i think the biggest the difference between um the game five and uh the traditional game there is a three big is the difference the first of all is the character in the games become valuable so before that like any characters in the game right so it doesn't come so no matter how you play it right at the end of the day you're gonna give up the game you know it's become ",
        "27": "like one of your collections right like tradable right so it's gonna forever like see there but now we have cheat and technology you can literally like trade your character with others like treat all the equipment everything so the game becomes like super liquid so i think that's like the the first uh the biggest difference and then the second difference is um the token itself also is very liquid so these days like all the uh games you play the game you earn in the game uh the tokens you earn in the game no matter it's diamond like gold or anything you can trade with others right and also you can bet on the ecosystem of the games which i think is definitely made the game itself very powerful than than before right and then the third one i think is um is decentralized game so the ",
        "28": "developer of the game is impossible to delete your content like like like basically ban your account right so all the behavior is impossible anymore so that's why i think uh google apple is freaking out you know uh because google apple this is in korea right last night the korean government too is saying you cannot have uh play to earn games uh in in the app store yes because first of all they are advocates like the closed worlds you know uh app app industry right so um so but i believe uh these kind of the play to earn concept will be very powerful so lots of the users will seek to play those game instead of right so you play like games in app store they push all the games to you like every day but i think those play to earn games will have loyal customers will follow follow the lead so so that's ",
        "29": "why i i'm very confident on play to earn game because i think it's so powerful compared to traditional game but i mean play to earn game it just needs to go through everything we go through in the past night right so first of all like app store won't let you listen right you have to just build on web because web is like the only free places right so uh so you you have to abandon all the traditional channel for traffic distribution right to build on your community from scratch you know bootstrapping everything right so so that's why i think this is um what play to earn games is to um basically uh doing all those things together um i don't think like apple and google will be happy about that because they will lose like 30 of the cut of the game yeah which they charging like every day today and also um and also this kind ",
        "30": "of the decentralized game they want they can't even have good relations with epic right so yeah epic is traditional player but they they can't even get along with them yeah yeah i don't think they can get along it seems like there's a lot of well i mean there is a lot of government pressure in many parts of the world on the whole economic model of the app stores and the anti-competitive nature of the app stores and um you know i mean we all remember when when apple and google banned any kind of crypto apps from the app store and that was a problem when we first launched circle was we were trying to build a payment experience using you know crypto but like using mobile inspired by like wechat pay but like trying to use you know crypto rails but like that's useless without uh a camera uh or or or you know these things and they were very very reluctant to allow ",
        "31": "that kind of new payment technology into their into their phones and eventually they did um and now it's it's it's common i have to assume that blockchain gaming right will be be so important that they will not want to lose out or or yeah some other well we'll see what happens but seems like that's going to be a collision yes i think it's just the same of the crypto story right i think at the end of the day if the words like top 10 game companies all blockchain based right apple google we might consider switch but right now i think still even animal car i know those uh uh companies grow are big but still i think in terms of the quality of the game right so uh and also the the complexity of the game uh still far away from like league of legends right so so those kind of the ",
        "32": "game so i think still uh we need lots of developments in the gaming industry to embrace uh this trend um but i think definitely next five ten years we will see a lot of pure blockchain based game yeah it's going to be super successful do you have like a game studio do you have like a a developer team of building games yes yeah that's how we build a wing active horse which is extremely popular uh we collaborate with finance like ob okay x for distribute the game right now we have like dau like over i think uh uh 30k which is already a big number yeah yeah yes yes and and and and i i think the proud things is we we never spend any money on ads so basically my twitter and the collaborator was exchanged so we got all the users so i'm not like where where where do we find it where do we find it ",
        "33": "uh just go to uh winglethorse.io so you can download the game and play so it's available on like mac windows uh uh android app right so yeah so yeah all right very interesting all right we'll we'll check that out um yeah so another you know another thing you know that has has emerged um and this maybe ties back to some of the earlier part of our conversation is yeah more and more like people are setting up um like the equivalent of a corporation on on chain right this is like dowse and and um and and they're creating these to organize investments they're creating these to organize creating things creating new software projects other things i'm interested in your perspective on ",
        "34": "what do you think is happening like big picture like what do you think is happening with people building these new kinds of coordination mechanisms like on the internet yes uh i i think i i'm super i'm big believer of tao and the spirit of dao that's also one of the i think biggest use case for blockchain but having been adopted by lots of people is is governance and decentralized id system yeah so if right so everybody like voting on blockchain uh we will have this kind of the disappear of election right which happens these days very frequently in the united states yeah um we won't have this kind of the disputes anymore because like every um transaction every voting system is uh it's purely unchecked right it's uh fully transparent uh everybody can ",
        "35": "check about that i think that that's the first thing and then the second thing is before i think it's adopted by like a u.s government even maybe in presidential election i think first we need to use this kind of the blockchain governance in your like community right neighbor like governance right uh a very small amount of people when they're trying to make decisions they can use this kind of the dog so that's why i think uh we we see like constitution dial right which those like early download the user case uh we have seen uh getting started but i think in the next five ten years i hope we can see state style right so basically some like small student in the uh uh solid nation will trend you like dial structure by i mean the eventually the goal right so we want like u.s ",
        "36": "a presidential election you become like like a dollar so everybody can vote on blockchain on-chain uh on-chain governance um it may be an interesting connection to um to the the recent big change that you made i mean you're getting in you're getting into politics uh sort of uh but um help help the listeners understand um you know how you got involved with grenada uh the the the role that you you now have um with the wto um and where you're trying to go with that yes sure definitely uh so first of all trunk uh is also one of the largest dao like in the in the markets uh tron is like fully decentralized so i'm sure tron will be fine without like my like day-to-day support but i will still be a very active uh community ",
        "37": "members to supporting and push forward like all the things happen in trial ecosystem uh just like italic did for uh ecrm right um and for um these kind of the uh new appointments uh i think first of all so i'm a huge fan for caribbean community uh because i think the overall caribbean community have several advantages uh the rest of the world just don't have uh first of all i think caribbean is very close to united states which is important you know you want to travel to united states like easily uh from those states and then those caribbean states is uh um is english based so everybody speak english it has very legit and uh um well established rule of law system um and also um um the caribbean states is very safe you know the infrastructure support is ",
        "38": "is very good uh if you compare to so basically it has the i think regulatory flexibility compared to u.s and china yeah and also it has a better rule of law and the infrastructure system if you want to compare them to uh like uh like like africa you you know uh south east asia you know uh and and the pacific ocean like uh and also it's very close to united states right if you compare it to new zealand and uh um and australia so so that's why uh i'm always like a big fan of uh caribbean states i visit lots of states there like uh like police uh um um sun kids uh dominica uh bahamas uh and i know lots of people moved to bahamas right like ftx like tether and circle uh um both us right so we ",
        "39": "visit panama oh sorry uh bermuda right yeah uh yeah and that's why i believe the next state stop if it's gonna really happen in our industry will be some caribbean countries uh i'm 100 sure so that's why i'm getting like very close to like caribbean community uh before that i already meet lots of like prime minister and and uh uh um basically head of states in different countries and then i think grenada is one of the states has most of the willingness to step into crypto and then they invite me to become their uh um national representative in grenada of grenada to wto because i think they really want someone to present them in wto um you know like all the current means countries states also have this kind of ",
        "40": "the uh recent um big problem because of the kovi right there most of the carbon states the biggest income national income is uh tourism right so it's got like very hard hits about like kobe uh with kobe so that's definitely they want find some place they can grow their economy which i definitely believe cryptocurrency and digital economy will be their best bet so that's why i want to also allocate my more time of myself time in um grenada wto issues and also persuade um more and more caribbean states to get into crypto and digital economy so that's why recently i visited like panama grenada um barbados uh dominica uh these four states yeah and ",
        "41": "i tended to like visit more uh in 2022 yeah so what is the what is the um the role in geneva gonna involve for you oh so first of all um right now i'm the ambassador of grenada to wto which our permanent mission is in geneva so i will um basically attending like all the wto conferences uh i think the u.s trade representative deputy u.s trade representative is the u.s um ambassador uh to wto uh i will met a lot with lots of my like uh colleagues in wto uh i think i will promote uh digital economy and blockchain in wto and hopefully right uh next year we can work things out and have lots of people in wto uh get involved in cryptocurrency uh since i mean that yo is like the uh uh un uh ",
        "42": "uh economic version right so yeah yeah yeah i mean it seems like um we will we will very likely see crypto economic systems cryptocurrency all of these things become bigger and bigger topics for the wto in the next five to ten years yes um i think they'll be very big topics because it's rebuilding the economic infrastructure of the world right so i i don't think people quite see it yet uh but it seems like it will you're you're positioning yourself in the right place uh for for these future conversations uh as well um well speaking of conversations this has been a great conversation justin really appreciate you uh taking the time to join us uh today yes thank you thank you jeremy absolutely [Music] "
