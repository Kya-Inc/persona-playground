        "0": "Hong Kong continues to draw in crypto enthusiasts by embracing web3 and creating regulatory Frameworks maybe a little bit faster than some other jurisdictions the government's positive attitude towards crypto has attracted several firms and leaders to the area including our next guest joining us now is Tron founder and Toby Global advisor Justin Sun welcome to the show Justin hello everyone Justin always a pleasure to have you on the show the last time you were here we were talking about Hobie Global's license in Hong Kong any progress there yes so everyone starts you operate exchanging Hong Kong so I I think hobby Hong Kong will be live in July 15th um so we have been prepared this for quite a long time and so far I think we started to have more details about what kind of the token we can list it uh how we can do KFC AML and what's the banking ",
        "1": "requirement for open bank accounts in Hong Kong so what what are those tokens that you can list can you tell us okay yeah yes sure so right now I think we received the guidance um basically it's more about like how how many of the index um include those tokens uh I think we have at least uh around like 20 of them and also uh be aware even without um index reference if you have um a big trading volume uh they still have a great period um you can apply those token if you want to list them but not a lot I think basically right now we want to get uh Chris period for several tokens especially for stablecoin because this is a very important for Opera crypto exchange so we apply for usdt ",
        "2": "usdc to USD and also um basically the major top 20 tokens in coin market cap hi Justin always nice to see you um so all right let's talk about some of the details here because I don't think that many people understand the process of getting an exchange licensed in Hong Kong and my understanding is that it's actually quite hard um and so I was wondering if you could talk about just some of like the challenges or some of the things that you have to do for example um I heard that um for Hong Kong exchanges you're not allowed to use third-party custody I don't know if that's correct or not but I heard that there's some rules that are very specific to to Hong Kong so if you could just talk about some of those challenges that would be helpful also are you guys going to be available for retail trade in in Hong Kong yes we are going to be available for retail trade uh I think depends on who is the investor or owner of the exchange right I think for ",
        "3": "um for example um you never operate like an exchange before I I believe Hong Kong license has a very high requirements uh exactly because they they require you to operate exchange on your own but the um custody can't leave Hong Kong so it's all going to be all the cold storage all the crypto assets needs to stay in Hong Kong and you need to have like a very robust basically hot water and the cold water security solution and also they require to have many uh Market civilians tours which prevents Market manipulation and also um it requires you to open like bank accounts in the major Hong Kong Banks uh ",
        "4": "I think we have deal a little bit math about operating Exchange in Hong Kong if you never operate exchange before I think at least you need to spend around 100 million uh Hong Kong dollars which are around like uh 15 million US dollars every year to operate exchange but for example like hobby we already have those systems so it's gonna be like I believe like 20 percent or 30 percent of the cost we estimated thank you for that uh description so let's just talk about Hawaii for a second so as we all know hobby was one of the biggest exchanges in mainland China that's where that's what Hawaii was right it was a Mainland Chinese really popular exchange right obviously it doesn't have that market anymore the way that it once did so I guess the question is like can hobby ever return to its former glory right like how are ",
        "5": "you going to kind of get hobby back to that that kind of status because now there's a lot of other exchanges you know that was really like Kobe's special thing right I'm not saying it can have another special thing but that was a special thing so what's the plan here like how do you how do you kind of resurrect Hobby yes uh first of all I believe we need to focus on Asian markets um of course I think hobby has the best reputation among all the Asia Traders and also right so recently we have seen um more and more Traders started to get excited about crypto because of Hong Kong new crypto regulation so that's why I think this is a big opportunity for hobby to dive into Hong Kong markets since this is most of the institution and the major investor um be aware like all the major ",
        "6": "Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong and trade their stocks in Hong Kong so actually Hong Kong has uh um the similar size of the markets compared to Mainland China in terms of stock trading so that's why I believe if crypto trading in Hong Kong will also share the similar ratio I think eventually so that's why I think we focus lots of our energy in Hong Kong and in the Asian markets so uh you know we have to address the elephant in the room and that is a binance uh largest Exchange in the world uh possibly based in Asia we don't really know no one really knows anymore so I invited or do you know of any moves on their part to try and find a home in Hong Kong and second of all uh obviously they've had some major c-suite ",
        "7": "departures as of late because of uh several different regulatory uh jurisdictions coming down on them what do you make of this is there is there an exodus out of uh finances binance in trouble yes so first of all I I believe Finance focus is more on the global markets so right now we still didn't see binance apply for Hong Kong local website operation um but I I believe eventually Hong Kong uh sorry I believe eventually finance will apply for that but you know Finance is aware has a very big market shares so that's why I think Hong Kong sorry Finance might need to get approval from the Hong Kong governments if they want to apply for a license because of course you know Finance entering like ",
        "8": "any new markets or jurisdictions uh will be very big locally like internationally so I think every Regulators will take more look at those applications than small exchange I think that's the first first thing second thing uh I think Finance International still like uh stands in a very big market share as far as I know right now binance still has more than 50 percent of the market share and I I also trade there all the time so I think right now I it seems to me binance.com is intact well why why are you trading on binance when you have Welby um I'm doing arbitrary trade um finance and hobby different exchange but mainly financially are you saying hobby has an efficient pricing ",
        "9": "who has a more inefficient pricing um I I think Karen still buy this uh I think hobby is around um 70 70 of the uh Marquee uh um trading volume and also uh in index book you know you've been reported of binance and CZ amongst the the sec's Crackdown on binance and like Lawrence mentioned we we've seen other Regulators kind of crack down on the exchange we've seen the c-suite um leave do you think that will hurt binance's case should they want to apply for a license in Hong Kong I believe that and finance eventually will apply Licensing in Hong Kong because this is a very big Market I think binance always wants to play a very big role in Asia markets as well we have seen binance acquire a Korean exchange to operate ",
        "10": "um licensed in Korean and also Finance also recently operate Exchange in Japan so so that's why I believe finance will eventually operate in Hong Kong but I think right now Hong Kong is not the priority for binance I think the binance right now the priority is still to sort it out like everything in United States hopefully eventually I hope both coinbase you know Finance can reach agreement with U.S Regulators eventually because it's gonna be um beneficial I think both regulators and the crypto world so Justin I imagine you're probably not primarily worried about coinbase and Finance in the United States because the SEC has also charged you and your companies with pretty soon it's like with uh you know fraud and other ",
        "11": "Securities Law violation sorry about you that's a bigger concern for you understandably um so let's just talk about that for a second I mean what do you think is going to happen here uh I imagine that you know you basically have to avoid the US market now for for at least some time um does that matter um is that affecting your business um and yeah what what do you think is going to be the outcome of of these SEC charges because they're I mean they're frankly they're they're pretty serious um sure um so first of all I think after you know finance and coinbase get charged by SEC we become the small potato and nobody even know this anymore right so uh but of course I think we um respect as easy and we hopefully eventually we can reach some of the agreements with some uh eventually but right now of course I think after us Regulators start to crack down crypto in United States ",
        "12": "um recently we have spent most of our time in Hong Kong to build a crypto World in Hong Kong I mean are you worried about this at all like I know maybe it's small potatoes couldn't compare to coinbase and by dance but like you know being charged with fraud and Securities Law violation like that's still like not great you know so so I mean is this a concern for you at all uh I I'm kind of optimistic eventually I think we can uh reach screaming with regulators Justin have you spoken to CZ lately uh yes yes we speak uh um all the time and so how's he doing given that this the c-speed is left like Lawrence mentioned earlier that he's being sued by all these Regulators how's he holding up first of all um employees left companies come and goes um it's normal right so once so ",
        "13": "so first of all it's not like uh I don't think it's like everyone live at once right so I think it's um uh a few employees uh left balance so that's the first take um I think at least the people um who talk to me um are all still stay with finance and also um Finance is a team more than a thousand employees these days so um so I wouldn't surprise right so if you have dozens of people left at once so um that's my first of all that's my take second I think I also believe exchange we need to look at their business like market share like trading volume I think Finance currently still uh is in a very healthy status ",
        "14": "charges and I think the larger Point here is that you're just still out there doing your thing in Asia cz's out there doing his thing all over the world does the US crypto Market still really matter at this point um I I think of course U.S crypto markets still matters I think in terms of like uh crypto um price you know and also uh for uh for everyone right still like one of the center of crypto but right now um it's um just like turns out for everyone right even including coinbase the ROI in United States is very bad right so even coinbase I think started to move their investment to Dubai like and Asia um so so that's why I think I even see ",
        "15": "the news says like coinbase starts you to contact like Hong Kong Regulators to explore the possibility if they can operate there so so that's why I think for the next probably one or two years the major narrative in crypto space is um is Webster in Hong Kong all right and Justin earlier this month the first real world asset product staked usdt launched on the Tron blockchain can you tell us a little bit more about that what people can expect yes sure um so stusdt is a product learned from um s-t-e-t-h so um compare similar to Lido so basically everyone can stake their uh stable coin currently only supports usdt but in the future I think usdc qsd usdd and the major stablecoin will be supported as ",
        "16": "well so basically you can stay um stake your stable point there and earn a interest around like four to five percent and you can withdraw and unstake your um stable coin at any time so basically it's just like stake eth product uh it's involved you know a stable Yale and good liquidity and tokenized um stable coin um yield stable quiet so so that's why I think it's a very good product so if you want to use them you can just go to uh stusdt.io and just take your stable coin and if you want to withdraw them you can withdraw them like instantly Justin thank you very much for joining the show this morning thank you that was TRON founder and foby Global advisor Justin Sen "
