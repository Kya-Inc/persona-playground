        "0": "crypto contagion fears are lingering in the crypto industry in the markets with Bitcoin minor core scientific the latest company to file for bankruptcy in the wake of ftx's implosion joining us now to talk to talk about the bearish sentiment out there is Justin's son he's a Tron founder who will be Global advisor and ambassador of Granada to the WTO Justin always a pleasure having you on the show so there's just a general unease out there also about the health of another crypto exchange binance and the exchange's dominance in this space right now and there were reports last week that you withdrew a combined 50 million dollars from the crypto exchange but you also tweeted a link to etherscan showing that you had deposited a hundred million in ustc back into the exchange can you clarify what happened yes I have done business with Finance ",
        "1": "since 2017 so since they first found it um so basically I think from this way I want to show the confidence for um Finance exchange I I think in the past the finance has been through a lot of Crisis uh including I remember in 2019 they have like 7 000 Bitcoin hack at that time I think I always want to be um play the role to help Finance to growth and show the confidence to their business so that's why we don't see lots of fun and also people is talking about our withdrawal funds from Finance I actually uh deposit 100 million usdc into Finance to show our confidence what did why did you decide to take money out as well oh okay uh so basically take money out like happened earlier so um because uh I ",
        "2": "just like uh swap uh busd uh with different blockchain so and then uh somebody see the address is actually withdraw around I think total of 50 million dollars out of Finance so there's lots of the people uh talking about is finance uh have any problems or anything so that's why also um the deposit is kind of like a a clarification for um the withdrawal I have done before which is totally like a normal business so you mentioned there's a lot of fun out there fear uncertainty and doubt especially last week we saw with Finance billions of dollars leaving the exchange there were concerns that some of the problems happening at FTX were also perhaps existing in finance in terms of maybe they were co-mingling funds between Finance U.S and finance ",
        "3": "International Maybe their BNB token uh which was their native which is their native exchange token was being used in a way to make their value exponentially more than what it is and uh concerns that BSC built binance smart chain is being is to centralized uh we were unsure how much CZ owns are those worries real or at all concerning to you as as far as I know um I think currently business current Finance business uh is healthy and also um since we have done lots of business with them I think it's all one-to-one I redeem and means posd all the time uh as far as I know uh right now all the business is not back to normal and even though we have seen uh billions of dollars withdrawal from ",
        "4": "Finance I think last week but I think right now for this week on the money inflow and the outflow um become I think back to normal so that's why I believe the father about Finance probably is be the the last uh negative news about crypto industry hopefully in this year and for next year we can start to see the pool rally well Mr Ambassador where do you suppose uh binance is getting that billion dollars that it's using to purchase Voyager voyager's assets and why are they purchasing it um you know obviously there's this belief that it might have been at a discount but nonetheless uh why are they expanding out of time when they're seeing all these outflows yes sure definitely I think for the deal with the Voyager is has been a quite a long battle between binance and the FTX ",
        "5": "um so before on the implosion of FTX I think um FTX actually uh win the B so I think that Finance has been on this Voyager acquisition uh for quite a long time so so that's why uh after uh FTX actually from this particular acquisition I think Sims Finance to be the only choice here do you have an update on your algorithmic stablecoin usdd last week you tweeted that you were quote deploying more Capital steady Lads which is obviously a nod to Joe Quan when he was trying to save his own algorithm stable coin too which stud ultimately didn't work out why are you scaring your customers like that um so I think this is more like a a meme right so it's like a crypto meme so so everybody is using steady lace ",
        "6": "um you to show this kind of become like a crypto Community meme so that's why I I treat it this way but also the same time I think usdd price has been stable uh is about like 1998 cents like all the time so I think probably within this week after all the father is gone it's gonna be back to uh one to one pack and also I I think I'm happy to see Marty and start to learn about the difference between usdd um TRX and USD Luna comparison right so that's why uh we have seen the TRX price is also outperformed even Bitcoin and the ethereum uh this week so we didn't see like any usdd file that have any impact on PRX price anymore true USD also is launching a TC and H ",
        "7": "which is a Tron based stablecoin Peg to the offshore Chinese Yuan maybe you can explain how it works for us sure for sure so actually you know Chinese Yuan has been a long dominate currency for crypto industry I think 2013. so start from 2013 to 2017 actually the major uh fear dominates the crypto Market is Chinese Yuan after you know 2017 the major exchange actually from Chinese Grand Market we start to see what we have seen today oh the major stable coin in the market is dominated by US dollars so that's why I believe this is a very good chance for us to collaborate with not only true SD but also tether to issue um qusd I'm sorry TCH and CHT Antoine I ",
        "8": "believe in the next year um probably we will see a much um traffic and also attraction on Chinese Yuan because lots of people I I believe at least two billion people are in Asia they are prefer Chinese Yuan rather than US dollar so so that's why also uh with we will have seen like Chinese Chinese government has opened up their border and Chinese people life is back to normal so I will I believe we will see the Chinese yen will have lots of attraction in the future uh it nonetheless I mean obviously you'd be potentially be competing with the with the cbdc at some point if you're doing a stable Point uh on stable coin will you have um will you have any pushback from the Chinese government are there any ",
        "9": "restrictions uh to this uh stable coin for either Chinese citizens or or how much you can do Etc um to prevent it from uh potentially turning into a printing of one because of course uh you know I do you have to you know are there any restrictions as in terms of making sure that they're exchanging actual one in the markets for ones that are uh for the stable coin or are you taking in dollars for instance and issuing the uh on yes sure so um right now the product we are issuing is offshore Chinese yen so it's one to one um to Chinese and of course but in the offshore bank so so basically uh um you will have just like same with usdt usdc uh you have one to one of the currency in the bank um but the difference is compared to the ",
        "10": "Chinese student Chinese people use every day this is offshore Chinese yuan in offshore Banks so that's why we don't have any limitation on how much you can purchase or how much you can redeem every day so basically this is like a limited uh usage and also of course we have seen lots of people in Asia especially in Hong Kong um using Chinese yen all the time so that's why I believe this is also be a very good option for traditional FX trading uh and and also for even their daily usage uh and also the same time we have seen a big policy change happening in Hong Kong so Chinese uh sorry Hong Kong government uh Embrace crypto uh and also recently launched ETF so that's why I believe uh in the future uh Chinese ",
        "11": "government actually is very uh open and optimistic about crypto and uh I believe Hong Kong is the first experiment and they will continue to move and adopt crypto in the future all right well Justin we see your Tweet yeah you you mentioned that you can purchase license to BTC Futures ETF and China legally starting today if you understand recently Hong Kong also launched its first two exchange traded funds for crypto Futures and turning the city into a regional digital asset Hub rivaling Singapore uh do you see China and Hong Kong uh becoming the leaders again in the crypto industry yes I I think definitely this is uh what I will predict will happen in the future uh because before that I think ",
        "12": "2017's 2000 uh and the 13 these two um bull markets is dominated by uh actually Chinese buying power um 2021 is the first time you know us become one of the dominant power for bull markets uh but I think I believe the next full markets will still be on Chinese money uh actually uh from these regulated Hong Kong ETF um many people don't know is actually you can purchase in melon China so because melon China and Hong Kong has this kind of the channel so basically you can use even onshore on Chinese Yuan to purchase Hong Kong stock uh versus right so that's why I believe um this first ETF probably is the first first step and the second step we will see more and more as a managed company start to launch product for crypto and ",
        "13": "people from China they can use money to buy those Hong Kong products from this kind of the special Channel between Hong Kong and the mainland China so that's why I believe this is the first experiment it's just like Shenzhen experiment right when first when Chinese government introducing the opening policies they want to make sure this in a small special region so people can do the experiment first before they promote across the whole country so that's why I believe Hong Kong is playing Shenzhen role right now to become the experiment region for crypto "
