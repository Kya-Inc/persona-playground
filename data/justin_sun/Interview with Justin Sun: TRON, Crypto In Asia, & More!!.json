        "0": "hello everyone and welcome back to coinbureau I have a special guest with me on the stream today it is none other than Justin's son one of the most well-known well-recognized faces in all of crypto uh Justin has been in the crypto space for years now um is well known as the founder of Tron and many other things besides Justin thank you for joining me today it's great to Great to get this opportunity to talk with you yes definitely um so let's start Justin let's let's talk about Tron uh if we may now I know you're not as involved with Tron as you used to be in the past but um I wanted to ask like Tron at the moment one of its main use cases is as the kind of go-to blockchain for stable coins yeah and can I ask though what what sectors what other niches um do you think Tron is going to is going to fill in the future what else can we expect from the project yes um for strong uh strategy I think the number one priority uh still uh is ",
        "1": "stable coin uh even though I think trial today is the Gold Hill Place for stablecoin um but there is still a lot of scenes we need to accomplish here um first of all um is the variety choice of stablecoin So currently um right everyone is familiar with usdt on trunk but right now we actually collaborate with to ASD usdc on launching other centralized stable coin and The Regulators they require on top of trump and we are also collaborating with other regulated financial institutions to issue for example like JPY Hong Kong dollar you know C cnh on top of Trail Network as well so I think that's the first thing and also the same time decentralized stablecoin is also very important so last year we ",
        "2": "collaborated with usdd usdj and launched the decentralized stable coin on top of trump but right now we still need lots of the work to to continue to um to promote a decentralized stable coin on top of trump so which I think is also a very important segment for a stable coin I think besides stablecoin of course I think the the next step is rwa and the D5 uh um so which is built on top of stablecoin right so um this year um I think just like three months ago we collaborated with st usdt.io on launching the uh rwa first rwa protocol uh on top of trunk and also supports ethereum as well so ",
        "3": "basically uh you can get a very good liquidity withdraw um we think one or two days but also invest into um invest into a short-term government um tibials so that's but basically you can get around four to five percent of the Yale at the same time you can use on those products in the decentralized landing protocol like D5 Lego uh by the same time you can get yield so it's kind of like Lido um Lido eth right so basically you can get uh the Yale the same time uh and you can use those uh um products to increase liquidity so I think that's rwa and also of course D5 um so Tron has on the web loss of D5 products such as just land and also ",
        "4": "um um sound i o sound swap which focus on the token swap on trading and also Landing uh decentralized Landing protocol and other than that we also um spend lots of time on decentralized gaming and uh nft right so we have a wing and nft um apron ft um platform for trading in EFT and the game file on top of trump so I think today um so we are doing things in this kind of the priority to make sure um the the product um um it's good and also everyone enjoy um the blockchain infrastructure yeah yeah do you think I mean you know that's a that's a lot of uh that's a lot of particular niches that that Tron is looking to you know to support do you think do you think Tron can become as as ",
        "5": "big but you know support as big an ecosystem uh as other big layer ones like for instance ethereum in the future is that the is that the kind of overall plan yes uh so first of all I'm a big fan for multi-chan so um so I think in the future uh the more blockchain we have the um the more essential Lies We will get right so so that's why I think I'm a big fan for multi-chan um but I think for in terms of chuang itself uh I'm super confident it's gonna become like one of the most popular blockchain in the next like 10 like 20 years uh one of the reason is because the tvl on the blockchain right so I think right now um Trang um has on the Trump blockchain has holding the value I think almost um equivalent to ethereum uh right now ",
        "6": "all the values on Trump blockchain is around 50 billion dollars which is a very big number and uh on the total value log on Pro network is also has surpassed um um 13 billion dollars now and the trunk is handling over 12 billion dollars transaction every transaction uh every day so so that's why I think Tron has gained uh a big momentum and the Trump protocol in terms of the product of Revenue has surpassed Bitcoin so so that's why I think even though right now um the revenue is still um smaller than ethereum but I think we will get there so so that's why I think Truong blockchain right now has a huge potential sorry to interrupt you folks but I have to let you know about the coin Bureau deals page now my team and I have been ",
        "7": "able to pull together some of the best promos and discounts in the crypto space we're talking trading fee discounts of over 50 thousands of dollars in bonus airdrops amazing deals at top exchanges reduced prices on Hardware wallets and much much more besides so just go to coinbureau.com forward slash deals also linked to below and find the promo suited to you enjoy the rest of the video and um just then one thing I want one thing I wanted to touch on as well we're both uh we're both actually in Singapore at the moment yeah speaking I'm speaking remotely because of scheduling but um obviously token 2049 is is happening at the moment really big events um well I want something I wanted to ask you was obviously as I said in the intro you are you are really deeply involved with so many aspects of the crypto ecosystem um can I ask you about regulations and and in particular can you give me your ",
        "8": "view on on crypto regulations in in Asia because I feel that this is a good time to be talking about Asia and the Asian market yes sure definitely so I think for um for the global complex map right so I think the uh crypto regulation um the best regulation I APD is in uh Mid-American and uh Caribbean States uh Caribbean States um that I think that's the most uh friendly region right so like Dominica for example Dominica um as a country has adopted like TRX BTT as one uh usdt and TUSD on Chong as their legal tender right so so basically um and also we see El Salvador right adopt like Bitcoin as their legal tender so that's why I think me the American at the Caribbean has been the most friendly ",
        "9": "crypto region and the second uh I think is Asia so Asia is the second I think most friendly uh region for crypto and then it's uh it's uh Europe and Africa which I I'm thinking right now is kind of like undecided right but uh uh still we we have seen uh the regulation emerging in those regions um but the toughest one of course is U.S and Canada right so I think that's like the the regulation overall the regulation map globally uh so that's why I think Asia actually is good uh it's the second most friendly region I think um for example right uh Korea and the Japan uh has regularly crypto right so all the exchange and uh crypto in those regions has received license so it's uh ",
        "10": "it has no difference compared to you know trading stocks in NASDAQ basically right so um for Korea and the Japan and uh for Hong Kong and the Singapore I think the regulation is following right and Thailand of course I think Thailand also regulated crypto um and the Malaysia Indonesia those regions and we'll we'll follow as well so so that's why I think um for Asia it's definitely one of the most um friendly place for crypto and for myself of course I spend lots of time in Asia I will say like uh Korea last week and uh Japan in WebEx so so totally for myself I think I have confidence for the region um because you know uh even though I think uh Latin America and the Caribbean is the most friendly place but of course ",
        "11": "I think in terms of the population uh economic growth um Asia is still the the most powerful place right so that's why I think as long as Asia is moving um a U.S regulation will change eventually so so that's why I think currently we have put most of our energy in Asia okay and of course I mean Asia has has so many crypto users it's not just about it's not just about regulation but I think people across Asia I mean for instance places like Thailand and Vietnam have immense amounts of actual users people using crypto in everyday life you know to pay for pay for goods and services to remit money money etc etc um rather than kind of the pure speculation that we see in a lot of other jurisdictions so I guess kind of like Asia is is is ripe for for good regulation it's it's it's got kind of ",
        "12": "all the things in place to perhaps become maybe the next Center of crypto if if things continue to shift away from the United States do you think that's do you think that's something that could realistically happen yes um I agree with you for example right uh usdt uh usdc QSC Antoine actually widely used in like when then uh Malaysia um Thailand um those countries you you're saying um the one of the reason uh is because you know US dollar is kind of like take for granted for Western westerners because they all got a bank account right very easy to deposit their money into your bank account but for you know Vietnam um Thailand you know Malaysia those people has very hard to get access ",
        "13": "to U.S dollar in the first place so um I think the average cost for every users you get even like uh even like uh um like a USD bank account probably in five hundred dollars or even one thousand dollars it's not because of like when they open those bank accounts people charge them for that it's because you know there is no Bank actually receive U.S dollars in those regions in the first place for example if like anyone in the Thailand if they want to get U.S dollars account they might need to go to Bangkok to open bank accounts right and those Banks they only open bank accounts for people have certain amount of the money right that they can get the bank opened um so that's why um blockchain for example trial actually ",
        "14": "provide like everyone with some most convenient way to holding their money open blockchain addresses cost is zero right anyone with smartphone um can open like a a troll account like instantly and also they can receive stable coin after that right they can holding like US Dollars which that's why I believe the um blockchain actually is for the people on bank right to get back so so that's why um I think blockchain even has more um um more um basically a promising future than United States which reminds me of you know um back um 10 years ago in China when lots of people started to adopt like alipay one of the reason uh alipay is more like Internet payment right uh Ali payke like ",
        "15": "super popular in China like everyone has alipay account it's because Chinese people do not use um a credit card because of you know uh China is uh when China get into the uh Financial World um it's already like internet error right so nobody use credit card they direct jump into Internet payment but for us one of the reasons for the penetration rate of PayPal is very small uh compared to alipay is because most of the people in the United States still using credit card these days right so even they want to make payments they use credit card instead of like directly use like Internet payment so I think that's the huge difference here yeah it's fascinating uh the more sort of the more I dig into crypto and the more I learn more about other jurisdictions other areas of the world how like it's easy to forget because ",
        "16": "yeah I I'm you know I'm from the UK we're used to using credit and debit cards there but it's fascinating to hear about people using um using alipay and uh is it 10 cents as well in China that's very big yes yes yeah we chat paid that's right and then you've got things in Africa like m-pesa uh you know in parts of um Kenya and other parts of Africa and yeah it's fascinating to see how how different parts of the world you know use do payments in different ways and I guess uh Asia being sort of you know quite technologically minded in that sense makes it again like a good a good ground for for crypto adoption exactly yeah so um Justin I can ask just a couple more things um so we were talking earlier about some of the things that Tron is is going to explore in the future and going to support are there any particular uh crypto niches that you think are going to be particularly exciting particularly big over the next couple of years obviously we've talked about stable ",
        "17": "coins a lot um and I think the use cases for them are pretty clear and that's already one of the biggest sectors of crypto at the moment are there any other particular ones particular niches that you think are going to perhaps you know become more prominent over the next couple of years yes uh I think for uh for current strategy we are basically focused on all different types of the um um um demands um surrounding stable coin so I think after we are building basically a 40 billion dollars uh 50 billion dollars worth of the stable coin which I I think it will continue to grow probably in the next five ten years we are still thinking about building for example rwa like a fixed Yale product on top of trunk and also like a payday loan you know P2P loans you know which people ",
        "18": "for example people in the Europe in in UK can lend money to people in Kenya right uh just by uh peer-to-peer lending right so um so which is also very important use case I think um because right now these days for people um in UK right if you want to lend money in Africa it's very hard to do that um so because you know the traditional Finance traffic has a lot of the um uh obstacles you know prevent this from happening but I think on the blockchain peer-to-peer like instant settlement right this is definitely possible um we have like um 1.0 era of the landing um um here it's a just land you know RV compound but I think next next level gonna be the peer-to-peer landing around like globally right basically I think ",
        "19": "people can get yield from the stable whom they hold and the people can land stable coin right um to um to do business or or payment you know so that's something uh we are we are we we are focusing on um to provide a good um um basically services for people to lend money and to borrow money in the space and it sounds a bit Justin like you you're kind of going back a little bit to the to some of the roots of crypto which I mean we I remember a few years ago we heard the phrase Bank the unbanked quite a lot you know and that's I think that narrative seems to have been perhaps forgotten a little bit over perhaps you know all the kind of retail frenzy and stuff like that yeah it became it became perhaps a little bit of a cliche but it still seems that that you guys uh you know at Tron and elsewhere it still seems that there is that that focus is is coming back into ",
        "20": "play now you know it is about bringing people into into a financial system that they've been locked out of exactly so I think Truong right now we have over 180 million users right so but uh um still I believe this number is uh rally once more um in the future because I think in the future probably we can bring like a billion people on Earth all uh into crypto world and uh it is it no no one uh says like there's a rule like only one person can can get one uh bank account right so that's why I believe like in the future like everyone can get probably 10 accounts which you know are eight billion people on Earth probably have 80 billion accounts right so that's why uh I think uh crypto is still in a very early stage and we still probably only have like one or two percent of the penetration right here so ",
        "21": "we are still fighting for to get like eighty percent ninety percent uh in the next five ten years yeah it's gonna be it's gonna be a busy time and I guess you were talking about a kind of multi-chain future and I I suppose there's a lot of work to be done behind the scenes you know as you as you say if people are going to have different accounts and stuff they're going to have to be able to move between chains kind of seamlessly aren't they you know there's a there's a lot of infrastructure still to be built exactly yes uh crypto is still in a very early stage so uh even myself uh is not satisfied with the things we built at all even though I have built those things for almost 10 years now but still I understand I uh I talked with customers like every day I know their frustration you know I know like they they are not happy or satisfied with the product we build even I think it's way better than the traditional Finance but ",
        "22": "still there's a lot since uh we need to get down um so I think probably for the next 10 years we will have bad a product great there's a lot of work to do um Justin just before I let you go because I know how busy you are but uh can I just ask one more question it's more of a personal question I'm just really fascinated to know like you're one of the most well-known people in crypto you've been in the space for a very long time uh everyone everyone in the industry knows who you are and knows the work that you've done can I just ask you what that's like how you how you deal with that on a personal level and how you deal with the kind of scrutiny of it all yes so for me I mean a typical day I most of the time I work uh like 12 hours per day um I I break the 12 hours into four hours you know for a slot right so basically I think it's more like I can work one day uh like three days right ",
        "23": "because I have like uh well some of the people probably they only work like four hours a day so for me right it's like a three days so I break into into these three slots and allocate to probably um internal management right talk to the team uh interview for the new employee and also allocate some of the time to talk to Media you know talk events you know to get more developer excited and also I also spend like around four hours still learning uh the new opportunity and the new trends on new technology in the space so um and the rest of the time is just replicate those efforts there's always there's always more work to do yes yes definitely fantastic well Justin thanks for taking ",
        "24": "the time to talk to me today I really appreciate it I know it's it's a busy week there's a lot going on and as you say you've got you know there's so much that you're working on so much work still to do but um but thank you for this and um enjoy the rest of your time in Singapore and I hope we can I hope we can talk again soon in the future yes definitely thank you "
