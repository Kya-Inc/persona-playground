        "0": "so this is Justin Roberti with benzinga writer and producer I'm here with the great Justin's son uh founder of Tron founder of BitTorrent uh very much a known figure and leader within the web 3 space Justin it's an honor to have you here today thank you for joining us um so I wanted to ask from the the that Tron shared with me that for the past several months at least Tron has has really been the primary Network for usdt usage which is really interesting because that that's where people are actually using it on a practical day-to-day basis as a currency um you know is this uh is this an important Phenomenon with within the crypto space uh what what is what does it mean to you to have Tron be the number one uh used Network for usdt okay yes uh first of all I think people in the United States ",
        "1": "um they don't really like know he's actually you know uh for most of the country in the world it's very hard to get access to U.S dollars uh in the first place so so that's why you know usdc uh super common in United States because you can use Bank as a via on-ramp and off-ramp to get access to usdc uh but for people outside of us um basically like keep yourself um don't even have U.S bank account in the first place so that's why I believe uh usbp on Trump provide them with a very precious opportunity they can actually get access to U.S dollars in the first place for example people in Vietnam people in Malaysia people in Africa South America it's a very good way for them to actually get access to ",
        "2": "U.S dollars without holding a U.S bank account because most of the people in those evolving countries they don't even have big U.S banks right open branches there so the majority of the solution is called their local currency but for local currency as we all know um the value goes down like dramatically right so that's why I think USB can try even become like an alternative for them to storage their value and also of course they can make payment um this is a perfect global payment Network everyone is using uh So currently I think yesterday our transaction volume is uh about 14 billion US dollars per day um so since the Inception of the network we have down seven trillion dollars ",
        "3": "worth of transaction uh which is big uh and today our daily active users is around uh 2.5 million to 3 million uh three million users uh with around um 9 to 10 million transactions per day so so it is very active increase uh about like 30 compared to to Q4 last year um so we believe uh it's gonna continue to grow since more and more people has this kind of the demand I especially outside of the United States so definitely we will continue to work on to drive the um the usage and to provide um web free and blockchain as well the most important infrastructure globally yeah that that's wow that that is a a ",
        "4": "crazy amount of transactions on the network and very impressive um you know what what does it mean to these Global users who are using it at you know because they don't have access to necessarily a stable fiat currency which is something that's very easy to take for take for granted here in the U.S even though inflation's kind of a problem right now we have a fairly stable currency uh to people who don't have access the the underbanked or the unbanked what does it mean to them to be able to use USC usdt on a global basis like that yes um first of all I believe um The View here of blockchain is to open you can get actually accounts for free uh and uh without like uh basically any uh banking resources you can get a account so for most of the um we know ",
        "5": "lots of like failure States and also um poverty uh actually is now like created by um basically lack of food or that lack of water I think the loss of the poverty actually caused by lack of financial services you know for for example for people in the Africa one of the biggest pen point for them to to preserve their wealth is there is no way for them to storage their value right even for example they farm and they store anything but they can't get access to bank account they can get robbed like overnight and there's no bands to hold those values and also that of course the cost of open banks in those regions is um is Big so so that's why there is even like Citibank SHP see you know Bank of America like nobody even bothered to ",
        "6": "open banks in the walking States but actually blockchain provide them with uh with a fabulous solution they can yeah like whatever like bank accounts they want uh basically accounts right they want unlocked uh with zero um basically zero cost and they can use this account to receive money store value and also like no one in the world or even know oh they have money in those accounts right because blockchain is also Anonymous so so that's why I think in lots of the developing States uh people starting to get access to financial services which I think is is extremely important because those countries don't even have capability to get access to financial services financial services is very common in U.S ",
        "7": "right everybody Advance has bank account has credit card but actually you know even in China for example only uh I think less than 10 percent of the people has credit cards so so that's why I believe uh um blockchain become like one of the most important infrastructure uh just like gas you know just like water you know like everybody can use every day uh without a very big cost because we don't know like the valuation of all the financial institutions is Big right they spend trillions of dollars like every year to build Branch to build a financial system but blockchain and website actually bring down all the cost right so so basically every day right now for the trial Network users they spend zero dollars on getting accounts and spend only like 20 cents like 15 cents on each transaction uh which is ",
        "8": "also a big Advantage for for those people um so so that's why I always believe uh stable quiet especially U.S one uh um actually has the biggest use case actually outside of us because in U.S like everybody has ACS right everybody have bank accounts in Wells Fargo and Bank of America so it's not like much for them but for people in the developing States getting accounts for free and and feel free to use US Dollars actually it's a very big benefit mm-hmm no that absolutely you know uh what are people I I know that uh Tron is uh looking at sort of a global picture in terms of the usefulness of blockchain uh and of cryptocurrencies and you've always been a leader in in the web three space that has has a very clear vision ",
        "9": "and a lot to say about it you know what what would you say to uh people who don't see it as a global vision who are frankly a little bit uh Silicon Valley focused uh you know is it possible to look at the at the big picture well well being that focused on what's going on in California it seems it seems limiting um what would be uh what would be the vision as you would describe it what what is the future that you're working toward with Tron yes um I think for Trump uh definitely we have a global version right right so we we take uh um all the countries as same right because I believe since chuang is uh at the Orbee um it's all infrastructure provider right so we believe like financial services and the blockchain services is something everyone will need in the future um it's just like gas like water is basic need for human beings right so ",
        "10": "that's why we want to develop um the cheap solution uh cheap and the sufficient solution and provide to everyone in the world with this kind of a solution um actually you know I born in China and and uh in my 20s I moved to United States and I started my first company also in Silicon Valley in California um but I mean recently right since uh we have seen uh this kind of the narrow months in United States you know SCC is doing lots of entrepreneurs and try to kick like crypto out of United States and a lot of people are thinking right crypto bring lots of risk to United States you know and also they don't care about what happened outside of U.S um that's like something I I think they are going to a broad house actually right so I'll point you up around us in ",
        "11": "history actually you know if we see like how United States succeed to be the number one country in the world is because like U.S cares about um like everything happened globally and once you like help people globally and also at the same time U.S is one of the best solution and offer to everybody in the world right not even talk to you um like had acknowledge which we use every day even like McDonald's you know Coca-Cola it is like this is even food right so we can promote like globally so that's why um right now and if you want to become like one of the bridge to bridge um basically the uh the best technology in Silicon Valley and the ways of the developing States uh in the world because I believe this is also one of the biggest advantage and the mission when you you benefit everyone in the world with website ",
        "12": "well that's great thank you so much we're going to be talking about uh Global use cases today with Tron later on in the panel here on crypto unlocked we really appreciate you taking the uh the time to to uh to visit with us and discuss these topics we hope that you come back again thank you so much for joining us today thank you thank you very much take care Justin "
