I'm back from Canada and that is why we're a bit late today we're six hours we're doing this a seven hours later than usual and the reason is of course because I've been to Canada I've been to the US I've done so many different things during the past week and I know you guys have been so worried I've seen so many messages people rising and asking Ivan where are you what is happening and although I've been clear on all social media that I will be gone for one week still people were very worried and it is so amazing to see like to see you guys that you were expecting episodes as always and so many of you did check and wonder where is Ivan what is happening it really really made made my days brighter to see that actually people are appreciating the content so welcome everyone who is watching live and it has happened so much during this past week it's really insane we will be talking about the price number one this is the most important thing that many ",
        "1": "people are wondering where are we going price-wise in Bitcoin and encryptor as a whole that is number one number two we will be talking about Tron because you know that originally I was like I was supposed to go to the Warren Buffett and just in San lunch and we were supposed to meet both Warren Buffett and Justin sand they were supposed to have a press conference suddenly it did not happen suddenly the whole thing was cancelled because Justin had kidney stones then people were speculating maybe the Chinese government is after Justin and maybe he's being detained in China and I saw a funny comment in the chat that people are saying that if it was the case then he would announce Chinese government as Strong's partners which is quite interesting so actually he was not in China he was in the US I get the chance to meet him and I got the chance to meet him and his team and the offices we watched all of that so I will give you that interview in this video you will get to watch the issue with Justin Sun also I will be talking about run as a project because I've been at their offices right now and it was so good to ",
        "2": "meet for example altcoin daily we also had the crypto zombie over there at Tron thanks man thanks bro and there's so many other influencers so there is a lot to discuss there then we'll be talking about Bank of you know that they have published that some statements on Bitcoin in particular and on cryptocurrencies and we'll be talking about IRS because IRS is coming after crypto traders in the US so a lot to discuss guys simply put a lot to discuss welcome everyone to the chat man I've missed you I've missed you so much it's really insane you go away for a week and you really get the feelings that okay now it's time to go back time to go back to work time to go back to the guys and this is so amazing to see that you guys are here first of all I want to start this stream with kind of a tragic news the fact that Tyler Jenks passed away and you know that Tyler Jenks was maybe the remain educator of the hyper wave theory I think he was the one who really invented this whole concept Tyler Jenks was on my channel a few months back we discussed his ",
        "3": "predictions on Bitcoin and really how he reasoned about cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin thanks man yes indeed thanks man fabric king you're amazing thanks for the generous donation we discussed them his views on the cryptocurrency markets we discussed where bitcoin is going he predicted 1k Bitcoin that did not turn out to be true but now you see how much love Tyler really had in the space because he passed away this week and so many people have been really really commenting so many great stuff so I want to give a shout out to Tyler and unfortunately we see this tragic happening with his with him passing away and he was an amazing guest I did not know him a lot I did not know him a lot I have followed his channel for quite some time and unfortunately he has now passed away and if you haven't go to Tom wayes channel and watch this episode they did about Tyler Jenks because it was really interesting to see how they met and really their their business story and how how meaningful Tyler was to tone and Lea in particular so this is ",
        "4": "something I want to start with and really give this tribute to Tyler Jenks and something we have to understand is that positivity in the space is much larger than negativity and this is true whenever you see you know people online people whatever but in all parts of our cryptid community positivity is always bigger than negative is here unfortunately we do have a lot of negativity in the space as well and I know it firsthand because being a crypto influencer you get a lot of negativity but way more positivity and unfortunately because the hyper wave he was talking about 1k for one Bitcoin and the fact that we would go lower people wrote so many mean things to him during that time unfortunately and now it is good to see that they are really really a small minority and that most people actually appreciate him so so much and I mean just a comment on this whole crypto industry we do have nowadays people who have this gossip as a service drama as a service as business model and the reason is because they simply do not have anything else to say and their content is not interesting so the only way they can be relevant is by ",
        "5": "spreading gossip and drama and this is so unfortunate but this is something new to keep in mind and always keep in mind that the positivity is bigger than the negativity in this space and once again a big tribute to Tyler Jenks now looking at the price honestly what the price nothing has happened and not a lot has happened since I left a week ago because we were talking about the fact that a beacon is gonna go to this people naturally tradesmen's level of 0.78 and we did see some bouncing back and forth but still I'm person anticipating this this bounce to eight point six eight point five people are of course talking about the fact that futures need to be filled the gaps in the futures need to be filled and therefore many people are discussing a eight point five because we need to fill this gap in the seamy futures and the whole idea behind this is something that time that crown talked about on the channel I think we will have crown back to this week it's really been a long time since crown was on the channel and I really miss him on this channel he's amazing well he talks at talks also about the fact that hey probably we will have to fill these gaps ",
        "6": "before we can move forward so this is something to keep in mind with the price the the whole the whole consensus in the markets right now is that we're going lower and of course guys you know that we do have our collaboration with buy bit and the good thing with diabetes that you get $60.00 completely free if you follow the link in the description so definitely join mine bit and the thing with buy bit is that you can short you can long you can also use leverage and all of these tools are very important but leverage of course you should be very careful when guess when you do like hundred x leverage it is no longer tracing it is gambling and also you can relive a review or four by bit on exchange ratings that come you can find the link in the description and just tell us what you thought about by bit we just listed them on exchange racing now looking at our industry and looking at our markets today what do we have nothing really has happened since yesterday the markets are quite still looking at the big winners we do have Nash at 22% you know that Nash is decentralized exchange originally they were supposed to be on on the new I think they're still on new but they did ",
        "7": "rebrand to Nash then you have lambda at the 12% you have Raven Cohen at 5% Aurora for 4% nothing really happened look at the big losers Japan content man this and content is either in the top or at the bottom each and every I know how many times I saw this and content they are really really moving the heavier market a lot and yeah look at this chart is it's really insane movement sometimes you see in Japan content and do you know what there is let me know if you are a fan of Japan content and really what what is happening with that because the only thing we see is that they're either performing very well or they're not performing well at all now coming back to the story with Warren Buffett and Justin sands so last last Friday we went to Canada and it was really amazing all of you guys who have followed me on Instagram or all of you who have seen this stories here on YouTube you know that we did the meetup in Toronto was amazing we also met some some people with different projects and companies I met Deloitte in Toronto talking about how they're working as a very very big ",
        "8": "accounting firm and really how they're involved in forensics and cryptocurrencies so that was very interesting but then after Canada we were supposed to go to San Francisco in order to meet Warren Buffett and Justin Sun that was the whole idea but suddenly we got this message that hey actually the the thing is cancelled this whole event is canceled because Justin Sun has kidney stones and obviously I personally was very very disappointed because one of the reasons why I went to Canada and why I was supposed to go to San Francisco was Warren Buffett and then this Warren Buffett event really turned into a day at Tron so I thought okay let's do a day at Tron so we can learn about what is happening at Tron and the what they're doing we can meet the team and the good thing is what was that they actually invited a lot of other influencers so I met crypto zombie here for example I also met all con daily and great guys I mean really I'll contain you don't see them a lot like their faces on the YouTube channel but they're such such great guys and if you haven't check out their video just you know search this did I change my mind don't ",
        "9": "run I put it in the description as well and you can watch this whole video they did at the event and also I interviewed here a few times in their video and it was really really amazing so I do recommend you check out all con daily and their video on this whole thing but let's talk about Ron and really what what was what happened did I change my mind did they change my mind did I get some information about what happened and after that I will show you a short interview with Justin son because I got the opportunity to interview him well let's do some backstory first of all why is strong so significant in terms of PR and marketing and why are people's talking about it so much I mean throne today is very very different from what Ron was in the beginning and they really changed their projects so much from the original white paper I mean if you read their origin of white paper the consensus is different everything is different oh the whole the whole philosophy is different and goals of the project are different now Tron is like us or a theorem or whatever else you have like a general purpose platform ",
        "10": "for smart contracts that that is what Ron is and now what's interesting with Ron is that they did acquire BitTorrent we talked about it a lot at the event as well with the Torah with the Tron team and from developers and now they're pushing a lot this fact that they do have the BitTorrent integration happening and BitTorrent has this and this many millions users using them and so on so forth now the important thing with BitTorrent is to realize that it is very different from from just the company I mean BitTorrent is a corporation but also you have the torrent protocols and torrent protocols are completely completely detached from the client BitTorrent so yes you can use the BitTorrent client to download torrents or you could use uTorrent or you could use whatever client there is there are so many different clients so this is the first thing we have to realize that when we're talking about Ron we're talking about bittern we need to realize that when we're talking about BitTorrent Corporation we're only talking about the BitTorrent client we're not talking about the fact that they owned the whole protocol that is BitTorrent and this is very ",
        "11": "number two it's important to realize that having BitTorrent doesn't mean that you have on board did all of them on Tron it is very very difficult to do because now you need to introduce a small friction to their experience I mean yes you can create a token you can add it to the BitTorrent client but then how do you get people to use it this is the biggest issue because the reason why people have BitTorrent is what because of Tron it is because they want to download files and that is it if they want to download files that want to share movies they want to download movies or whatever they want to do on on that on that client it's all about sharing files the original user did not come to BitTorrent because he was interested in blockchain so this is the biggest challenge in my view how do they take the users that they have that they control add their client and convert them into the Tron it into a Tron ecosystem is going to be very difficult but what I did learn that that changed my mind in a positive way is the fact that they do have an office who they do have employees in the u.s. they are working I met with the tech guys as well ",
        "12": "and they could explain a bit what's happening with the torrent a BitTorrent client and so on and how everything is developing so that is for sure they do you have people in San Francisco that are working they do have an office and this is so important to learn when you're studying projects because it is so easy to just read and get your and get your perception of a project online and it's a whole other thing to actually be there and meet them and see them now I want to play you a clip from the Tron after-party where I get got to introducing Sam it was actually the same day that we were supposed to meet to do the Warren Buffett lunch but instead of Justin having lunch with Warren Buffett we got to eat Warren Buffett's lunch it was very interesting we were at the same restaurant it was like three Michelin fancy restaurant and all of you who follow me on Instagram you know that and then after that we went to this after party with Tron people and there I get to introduce since and so I don't know why but the same day he was supposed to meet Warren Buffett he did not meet more and Buffett but he did meet me so this is good and you know why because I'm ",
        "13": "more important than Warren Buffett as you can understand from this situation so this is the thing I wouldn't take I got to each of you and I want to show you it right now so it's gonna be three four minutes and we're going to talk about his health what they're doing and some support and let me know if the sound is working that is the most important thing let me know the if the sound is working let's do it alright guys we're here with one and only Justin son Justin first of all thank you so much for taking the interview how is your health right now yeah I think I'm feel better and I will be back to work tomorrow so right now with everything that is good that was going to happen with Warren Buffett lunch so much attention has been on the lunch when do you think approximately we will see the lunch do you have any idea so basically we just postpone the lunch so after like all the people reached agreement on the timetable and the schedule I think we will restart the lunch but I haven't ",
        "14": "known schedule yeah but we will see looking at the Tron right now the project what do you think is your biggest difficulty to compete better with the theorem and iOS and other project what is your biggest obstacle what is your biggest challenge right now as a project yeah sure definitely I think right now the biggest on Cisco still the threshold for the unblock the people who didn't know the blockchain is still very high so if we want to explain how to use the blockchain or what's the cryptocurrency to our common people it's very hard for them to understand where a I used to that so basically right now we just trying to make the cryptocurrency available to more people for example we shape the bit hornsby last quarter and then we will make more changes so right now if you download uTorrent bit horan from the BitTorrent home slash speed you can't have said our ",
        "15": "product how is that integration going between BitTorrent and Tron because earlier Tron acquired BitTorrent and then now you're get you get you're integrating with BitTorrent how is that progress going right now yeah I think he's pretty good right now everybody can code you the pin Horan slash suite you download Prada and we will roll out to our fresh downloaders this quarter and we'll roll out to all of our user base in q4 finally Justin what is the Bitcoin price gonna be at the end of 2019 a quick price position it's very hard to predict but I will see definitely this year is more of the mystic than what I will fall in the January so Bitcoin has back to you 10k I think lots of the mainstream cryptocurrency will at least the back to the 50% of the all-time high at the end ",
        "16": "of this year okay there you go there we go guys there you go guys it was a quick entry because I mean this guy had so many people over him and it was good that I got to be the first one to interview him so that was very very good of him and actually the thing I also learned is that he is quite humble of course on social media he's not humble but in person I mean he was not it was not not an issue to interview him and to get a hold of him so as you see one of the biggest challenge that he recognizes himself is just the friction and from his perspective they do have millions of users in BitTorrent how do you convert them and their biggest sale point right now is the BitTorrent client and the trying to convert those users into Tron will it work will not work we will see but one thing is clear it was I mean it was good to see the the offices were good to talk to the developers and right now it's all about getting the developers I mean this is the biggest ",
        "17": "issue that the Tron has right now in my view getting the developers because you cannot compare the Tron development community at least for now with the Syrian community or with us community and really they need to focus on a few things to really reach a whole other level where they will compete better number one they need to have better developer onboarding as a developer when you want to start developing you to have a nice tutorial you need to have a nice way for people to understand how to build their first app and deploy the first app and this is something that many Chinese projects are struggling with I mean their documentation is in Chinese in many cases this is three or also four for example koco's the gaming platform that we've had on the channel a few times I mean you read documentation it's in Chinese obviously nobody understands that in the Western world so number one have a good onboarding experience this is the first and most important thing number two you need to have a community that helps each other because a lot of the development is actually when you have a problem you search for it on the Internet you as a ",
        "18": "developer you do not have all the answers by yourself but you do Google a lot maybe the most important tool for all developers is just trying to find the issues online and see if somebody else has solved them especially when you're starting with a new project and things do not work for you and you do not understand it really how to use the code and how to use the libraries yet so this is also something that is missing withdrawn a very nice basically a forum like Stack Overflow for Tron this this is still missing and this is still not there that being said I did meet also fat TV you know the YouTube channel fat TV I did meet them as well at the at this event and they are developing a game like a 3d game with crypto assets on trunk so they they got it to work but the threshold is still too high so this is my point and this is my view but all in all I mean with all the fans you got from 2017 and 2018 I'm of course talking about Tron with all the funds that they have received back then it is really really natural that now it's time to ",
        "19": "actually be delivering something real delivering real tools for developers developing real collaborations with for example bittern which they have acquired but also we saw so many other collaborations that did not turn out to be really true and so I'm following their development and we'll see what's gonna happen in the future but something that I really want to turn attention to right now is the fact that a lot has to do with China I mean the fact that he had to cancel the warren buffett lunch in my view has a lot to do with china and we did discuss with their PR people as well the fact that the trade war is in many ways affecting the chinese project and the trade war with the US could be the reason why justin son had to calm down and he actually had to apologize on the chinese social media about the fact that he overhyped the lunch the guy I'm speaking about is the cliff Edward so cliff Edwards is this person right here he really was our host for the day and we got to speak about a lot during the lunch which which was supposed to happen ",
        "20": "with Warren Buffett but we we ate the lunch instead without without Warren Buffett so we talked a lot about the fact that you know in China they don't really like when you hype a lot when you hype yourself a lot and also you hide yourself in connection to Western leaders Western celebrities and so on so forth so in fact that just in son is making so much buzz in the Western world is it could be a sign that the Chinese government is actually not really approving of that and he also had to apologize about over hyping it and maybe it was because he got pressured by Chinese government and they told me hey man calm down calm down we are in a trade the world is getting more and more serious so this is one of the angles that I did not think about before the fact that when you have a project that you are strong you do have a clear leader and this is just in son just in son can be in fact targeted by Chinese government if they want to and if that happens who knows what would happen to Tron because this is another thing to realize we did meet the meet them at their office but it also means that they ",
        "21": "have a centralized sim in many ways I mean their team is the Tron team and there are not many other competing clients like in Bitcoin you do have Bitcoin core you have so many other clients that are implementing the same protocol between quarters of course of course the biggest one but still you do have competing ones in the theorem you have anything more greens a organization and foundation and they are more decentralized you have different teams working on different implementations so you do for example have Aleph which is a theorem client you do have death and you do have so many other ones there's one written in Python so there are so many different clients competing with each other in front it's more centralized I mean they are a a corporation basically I mean they call them sauce foundation but in many ways it reminds of a corporation with a corporate office with headquarters thanks bro thanks bro the north nice nice nice nice thank you for the generous nation map so in that sense this is what we're seeing and you need to realize the difference between projects from a centralization standpoint there could be centralization on the protocol level but also on the team level so thrown in the ",
        "22": "is more centralized on the team level and if they get in trouble with the Chinese government it wouldn't be good for for the holders for sure but this story was not true about the fact that he got detained in China and he had to cancel the line she was in fact in San Francisco now moving on to two more of this China China action actually the Bank of China did pulls some educational material on crypto and on Bitcoin they basically posted an infographic how Bitcoin works and most importantly why it's valuable so I thought that was very interesting and this is something that the crypto Twitter has been covering a lot so you see some some more you see other people as well posting this this infographic that the Chinese government made seesee pump everyone everyone was talking about it and where they basically explained how Bitcoin works why it's important and why it's valuable and looking at this from a Chinese perspective it's also important to realize the fact that they really need to figure out a strategy in my view to ",
        "23": "deal with with Libra because another thing that was interesting on my trip is that we got to go to Facebook headquarters and the uber I want to give a shout to Valdemar Valdemar is following is like it's a good follower of the channel and he actually works as a manager on Facebook so we got a trip around him around the quarters and they will almost saw Mark Zuckerberg we almost saw him but then security came and we had to we had to move away but we almost saw a Mark Zuckerberg but anyway I think from the Chinese standpoint they do realize the fact that Libra is going to be regulated by the US they're gonna be playing on a on a global playing field but the only the only jurisdiction that might have control over them is the u.s. euros Asian so therefore in my view they are trying to figure out strategies to combat this now they're talking about why bitcoin is so important and why it has value I think they're really trying to do different tests publish this see how the public reacts publish something else see how the public reacts because ",
        "24": "you do see mixed signals from Chinese government we talk with box mining just a few weeks ago about the fact that China likes blockchain but not Bitcoin but now they actually publish the Bitcoin has value so you see mixed signals and I think the strategy here is just to try to post different things maybe they're contradicting themselves but still see how people react what is the reaction of the population on the different signals and then when they like a reaction they push on that on that front more but honestly this is so difficult for us in the Western world to to interpret I mean what do they mean and what will the future of this beam and they have of course banned the crypto mining and Bitcoin mining and they have banned the exchanges and so many different things so doing a business in China is difficult people are still doing it that that's the most important people are still doing it but it is not as easy as it was before and you need to have better connections you need to be in a better position when it comes to your relationship to the authorities in order ",
        "25": "to make it work so they have in one way made it more controllable by the government because people are still doing it officially you're not supposed to do it but the reason why people are still doing it is because they do have under-the-table deals this is what is going on right now and I think it's also interesting to follow this whole situation in Hong Kong right now and just to see how China is developing as a whole because China is a beast that is growing by the day is getting larger larger and larger and I think this century the 21st century proves that in many ways that you can have a an autocratic regime it does work in 21st century and you can be effective in the last century you could not really do that because a small group of people cannot make good decisions but and that is why all dictatorships have basically died or they have been unsuccessful because the democracies are way more successful during the 20th century but now with AI with machine learning with everything that is happening the fact that you do have information about ",
        "26": "everyone in your country I think the tides are changing a bit I mean obviously nobody wants to live in a dictatorship nobody wants to live in an autocratic regime but still I think is good - is good to acknowledge why they are successful today while just 20 years ago it would be so difficult to bet on China I mean imagine 20 years ago maybe 30 years ago when the Soviet Union fell how bullish would you be on the Chinese economy when Soviet Union just felt you wouldn't be very bullish everyone would be quite skeptical and quite negative and say that hey the communist regimes will all fall sooner or later and he has most of them did fall but at that time they did not have ai and technology enough to make it work because small group of people could not make good decisions now a small group of people could actually manage it with new technologies so and this is something to keep an eye on finally the final topic before we get into the AMA and kind of hang out in the chat the final topic I want to discuss with you is the IRS and ",
        "27": "the fact that the IRS has sent emails to crypto holders and how do they I mean they both send emails but also physical letters and we do see people on Twitter talking about these physical letters as well but what's important to note here is the fact that they do have your address I mean they are going to send 10,000 of this email by the years and by the end of 2019 and even in August they said they're gonna basically send all of them and the question is of course how what is your position what is your position in regards to the IRS and how will you how will you handle it let me just find this letter crypto tag by the way if you're not following crypto tags girl I think you should follow her and she has some good updates but she posted this letter right here so basically the letter said says the following we have information that you have or had one or more accounts containing virtual currency and but you have not probably reported your transactions involving virtual currency and so and so forth number one how do they get your address ",
