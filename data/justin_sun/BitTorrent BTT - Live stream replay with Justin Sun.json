        "0": "hi everyone hey guys um welcome to the BTT live streaming uh and this is also our first live streaming in 2019 um so today uh we will um talk about a brave introduction how PTT Works how BTT benefits the trunk community and what's the goal for the BTT in the future and that we will also talk a little bit about the nitron summit and our speaker in the January 17th and also we will also talk a little bit about current development of the BitTorrent and our products planning in the future um so we will get started as some of you ",
        "1": "may not know what trial is uh what's BitTorrent uh I will give you like a very brave introduction um trunk as we all know um is a smart contract platform uh we provide infrastructure for the developers to develop their the apps on our platform currently trong has already have more than 100 plus the app run on our platform you can check out the app review the app reader or trunk dot app and also Trump provides a very robust developer tools for every body so you can also join our GitHub Channel and ",
        "2": "slack Channel and also the Discord Channel uh also um BitTorrent as everybody know is the largest P2P uh file transfer protocol uh in the world and also uh it will win the santoshi mailing list back 10 years ago um in the mountains that people talk about how to monetize the BitTorrent with the Bitcoin together um so um even now um 2019 we occupy three percent of the Upstream traffic and then the 22 percent of the Upstream traffic in the world um two or three percent of the downstream uh 22 of the Upstream uh traffic in the world we still have uh around 100 million Mau 25 million Dau ",
        "3": "in 138 countries um so this is the like the massive adoption in the blockchain we are talking about and and then we will pray um bring huge volume into the industry because you know even right now um the whole blockchain population um is around 10 million something but even the return itself we can bring billions of the device into the industry that's why I think it's not only benefits the trans Society benefits the BitTorrent itself it's also benefits the the whole industry even some haters don't like that beat heart we will also benefit them yeah so let me tell you a little bit ",
        "4": "about the history of the BTT token and project we started investigating a system to add incentives to the BitTorrent protocol to enable longer swarm lifetimes and more seeds around a year ago then we as part of the acquisition we started to really go forward with that quickly it's been about four months since we started hiring aggressively and started to do the development really in Earnest the team size now is 17 total people working on all the components of the project cool um maybe we go to the second topic [Music] yeah so we've had a couple of questions since the announcement of the BTT token so um the first one is why do we choose to create a new token and how will that new token vtt benefit TRX and TRX holders yeah first of all um this is the since we really want to talk about first of all ",
        "5": "um a lot of the people already find out in the white paper so the current Tron Community will be allocated uh uh with the BTT so um so basically um the right now the TRX you hold you already get the rights to to get the um BTT TXU how do you already um entitled to the BTT airdrop so um this is the first part and it is very important to the TRX Community uh I will promise to everybody um I think the TRX Community has a huge tide with the BTT community so this is the first thing I think this is the direct connection and then the second thing is BTT used the trial ",
        "6": "Network um to to use transfer span the BTT token so BTT will bring huge attraction from the current Spirit community and the current speed current user base this is like the the tens of millions of the users we are we are talking about so they will get interested in BDT or even crypto and then they will get the TRX wallet and then they will also get into the Tron Community I know right now we have like millions of people in the Trump Community but I think this is just the start because in the future we're gonna have hundreds of millions people have billions of people in the community so this is just like the the first one percent of them and also I think the BTT and a bit hard ",
        "7": "and brand is more familiar with the current internet user base and also for the BitTorrent committee they are more familiar with the PTT and BitTorrent and also I think is uh obviously current 99 current 99 billion TRX is not enough distributed to the entire BitTorrent user base right yeah so that's why we also creates the PTT token available for the hundreds of millions of the active users for BitTorrent so that's also um uh we're gonna announce and also it's in the white paper we will AirDrop the ",
        "8": "BTT to the existing think of bitter users so they can also benefit and start to try the BitTorrent protocol and and our these new features in the protocol and also because um for the airdrop it's not going to be huge amount so if you really get interested in BTT get interested in the BitTorrent future you are definitely welcome to join the finance Launchpad to start your invest in the um PTT token and and then also but of course you you need to pass like all the kysa process we have like a section list so um for example like China United States on Thailand um some of the countries you come in West in the pre-sale and the public sale ",
        "9": "because of the regulation we're trying to be fully regulated here but if you get interested in the future you can definitely use the Bitcoin or um any cryptocurrency to buy the BTT in the future and also start to see the files and the resources to get BTT yeah yeah you you get like these different ways to get PTT yeah so the users will be able to seed uh in their client and then when other people are uploading to them they'll be able to accumulate more more vtt and so we wanted to make it so that we used a different token so that we address this giant potential Market without having to give all those people TRX in order to protect the existing TRX holders without diluting it by you know lots of TRX and to make it so that this is clearly the BTT token that's connected to this network utility of seating and downloading files uh can you talk more a little bit about ",
        "10": "the utility of the PTT and how it's like a playing the protocol yeah yeah so the the BitTorrent protocol historically you can consider it and some researchers have viewed it as an auction where you're auctioning your Upstream bandwidth like your computer's ability to upload files to other users on the basis of bids that they make to you by uploading to you so they they send you sort of bids of their bandwidth and then you send them your bandwidth uh the historical problem with the BitTorrent protocol has been that that makes sense while you're downloading the file because I need pieces from you you need pieces for me once you're done downloading the file you can seed but there's no built-in incentive to do so and it's a testament to the the strength of the BitTorrent community that even without that incentive there still are a lot of people that see it what we want to do is extend that so that there is a real fixed like tangible incentive for seating so if you continue to upload to other users those users can contribute these BTT tokens to you ",
        "11": "yeah exactly so um I also want to add is um this is just I think the first utility of the BTT so in the future uh we considering to expand to decentralized storage bandwidth sharing live streaming and all these um decentralized applications embedded into the bitter Network right so um this is just the first step um uh I think in the future um PTT will definitely has like a more user case and become even I think the one of the like the largest decentralized user case in the world right yeah today today the BitTorrent speed product that we describe in the white paper is about accelerating BitTorrent downloads so if someone has a torrent and you want to get pieces of it you can get it more quickly with the token but that's bandwidth right there's bandwidth for BitTorrent uploads you ",
        "12": "could imagine is something where instead is storage where if you want to store something persistently you can ask people in a swarm to store pieces in exchange for incentives or proxy like in a VPN like fashion or CDN there's there's not really any limit to the sorts of resources that you could you know contribute and earn tokens for in that way BitTorrent is just the vehicle to release it initially to this giant audience of 100 million monthly active users yeah and also um I know some of you may heard of like other projects um doing that um in case uh we now bring the haters so I won't name the project name right but everybody knows there's a other project it's also doing um this kind of the uh thing but when I check on their website and also check out their project uh the active users Mau Dau it's around like 1000 or something you know yeah even ",
        "13": "they they got this old publicity you know their product actually doesn't work at all and the the active users is very small user base you you even like have like more active users in like telegram group or something right we we even got like um 3 000 people's online or something so but this time um it's make huge difference because the like the bit horn protocol we have like 20 25 million people use it like every day around the world and also we got like a hundred million people use every month right yeah so this is a a real huge user case and then I think the the network effects also play in this industry for sure right be torrent and ",
        "14": "ethereum they achieve like a huge success it's because everybody in the world used the blockchain to transfer the from protocol um to transfer the tokens stuff like that and I think for the Beethoven it's the same we got like um almost everybody in the world to use the um product so definitely I think when we introducing all these decentralized application in the industry it's definitely got more a chance to succeed yeah definitely it's a very easy way to end introduce a big user base to this crypto enabled use case and make it so they can opt to use it and then learn more about Tron learn more about other cryptocurrencies and just really onboard a lot of people into the community yeah also um can I talk a little about why you choose strong and yeah sure so like two of the requirements that we had for this project were making it really easy for people to get set up with a wallet and a ",
        "15": "very high transactional processing rate so those are two areas where Tron really outshines the competition we have a huge network of users where there are millions and millions of downloads taking place per day and people are earning these tokens and eventually are going to want to have them on the Chain moving them around transferring them using them for other use cases fueling dapps with them and so when you take our huge user base and connect it to the chain you need a very high TPS rate and that's that's where Tron shines compared to the competition and the other area is like low friction creation so some other chains require like very large payments even to get started with an account we can't do that we need to make it so that people can just opt in and start going right away without having to make a huge payment also yeah we heard some some questions from the community uh like why are we doing the public sale or crowdfunding for BTD on the finance launch pad maybe ",
        "16": "we can explain a little bit Yeah so like Finance is a leader in the exchange space partly because of their very strong commitment to know what know your customer like kyc regulation they have a platform that makes it easy to exclude people in areas where it's not feasible to offer them the the tokens so in terms of compliance regulatory support and so forth they're the leader they're also very very easy to use so the the barrier to entry is low you can look at it sort of like um you know a Kickstarter for being able to to get these tokens being able to load them into a client and accelerate things you don't need to learn a lot you can just kind of like figure out the basics and get started right away yeah exactly so um we we are take the compliance very seriously right so uh even for the uh our project to begin with we want to complying with all the Regulators in the world so that's why we ",
        "17": "have this extension list to have like like a very detailed kyc yeah so like like everybody know the project is fully uh compliance and well in the Good Will to regulated our tokens um to be used by the everybody in the world yeah um and then um and also don't be fooled by like any scam maybe um in the space so um remember um the only um public sale we're doing is on the um binance launch pad you can't get PTT from someone else uh and also um also so for the official airdrop and all the airdrop announcement it's all in like the Trump foundation and also adjusting some um Twitter account so uh don't be fooled ",
        "18": "by like any other information some random guys talking the telegram group or some people like leave a message under my Twitter you know this is like a common scam everybody knows so um and only the source can only come from the binance Launchpad and my official Twitter account and also um we want to talk about the good relation uh with the binance so we everybody knows we start business um especially the trial since 2017. um so we collaborate with the finance on our uh even the Trump um public sale at that time and also we collaborate with um uh also on this thing and I think Finance is the early supporter for trial ",
        "19": "for almost two years so and also I think they they do scenes like very uh diligently and also uh carefully so that's why we choose them like exclusive Partners in the PTT public cell and I think the the finance also have devoted themselves into the decentralized world so they are very interested in the decentralized product I think that's also why the BitTorrent is a perfect good fee for the finance Launchpad yeah and also um we will start you um answer maybe one or two questions from the from today's live stream ",
        "20": "and then we will talk a little bit about Nitro and then we will finish today's live stream okay so there's the first one yeah cool um first of all uh BTT will definitely available for the India India I think in the end is now on the Ascension list uh and then also um I know the BitTorrent uh there's a very large amount of users come from India yeah yeah we have a huge user community in India that are very excited about the BitTorrent protocol so yeah just also give your hints I I think this year um like the uTorrent clients we we're also doing some great work on the Indian also yeah it will be released after the q1 yeah um you will see like ",
        "21": "uh uh fantastic product uh in the uTorrent uTorrent on the mobile side uh in the Indian as well yeah India is a huge Center for mobile user population so uh in India even outside of just BTT like stay tuned for other product developments from BitTorrent there yeah exactly so um yeah I think even we exclude the US investor in the public cell but definitely I think we are exploring uh the way to um to collaborate with the law firm um uh a very prestigious law firm and also our U.S Partners to um in the future I think definitely I have the confidence the BTT will also available for the U.S people in the future and fully comprised ",
        "22": "and regulated um and also um for the pair available for the BTT um first of all uh as a project manager or project owner I can't decide the pair for the PTT but definitely uh we are looking forward our partner in the future they can pair like the BTT slash TRX and we are also looking for the possibility we can have those pairs in the future um any question else looks like that's it from the live stream okay um yeah I will um talk a little bit about nitron um so first of all please join us on the Nitro um is January um 17th um to 18th so I will be here Kobe Bryant ",
