        "0": "just in Sun to reverse 56 million binance transfer after CZ warns against potential Sue token um also too you guys let's talk about some of the the tidbits from this story over here um CZ said binance warn Sun it will take action if he used any of the funds to buy up large amounts of Sue from binance's launch pool during the farming period he said the launch pool are meant for air drops for retail users not just a few Wills um I also want to add I'm sure that he means retail users in designated areas but you know you can only have a certain amount of characters per tweet um son told ZZ his team was not fully aware of the attended purpose of the funds so kind of like funds from my wallet went to like this other wallet and like I didn't know that I was controlling them or not um he says the funds are used to facilitate Market making between leading to USD exchanges thereby enhancing liquidity for trading and volume rather than participating in exchange promotions and suit is a native token of the layer 1 blockchain Sue um ",
        "1": "consensus spraying consensus rate Zach I saw your hand um I know you and Jen are totally fighting over this story it's super fun right yeah for sure so this is Sweet Factory Wendy I'm fat checking you on a Monday all right me and my speech impediment okay thank you it's all right Sue's my nickname people call me Sue back home so anyway just got a shout out just gotta protect the brand a little bit here anyway this is sweet sweet is an exciting new blockchain it's one of those ones that kind of emerge out of the ashes of Libra right it uses the move programming language it claims to be super performant we actually saw some news that consensus uh from one of the co-founders about how many transactions they claim to be able to process had some really sort of spiffy uh demo going on definitely recordings for the gaming sector it seems like at least out of the gate but this is again sort of a general purpose blockchain that can do lots of different things now people in the world are kind of pissed off at sweet because they're not doing an airdrop right all the dgns they love a good airdrop I understand why the team might not want to pursue that angle especially given the regulatory environment in the west and in the US specifically but this is sort of against that back backdrop right ",
        "2": "mainnet's going live I think May 3rd so people are looking to get those tokens they want those mainnet tokens they want to you know ride that pump should there be an initial one and people like Justin Sun are apt to play those games right it's just the Wales world and we're all living in it so this is sort of for that there is some Shenanigans up at the upper echelons of the bag holding world so anyway you know this is people trying to game these systems right trying to game these mainnet launches so they can stand to profit this is certainly not new in crypto people in crypto love doing this stuff whether you're airdrop whether you're like farming airdrops uh sort of low-key civil attacking trying to get as many wallets in on the white list as possible or you're doing some of this stuff that Justin sun is alleged to have done in this piece but yeah I think there's definitely some excitement around Suite as evidenced by uh Justin Sun trying to do his best to get in on that action but I don't know I don't know what the I don't know I don't know if there's a ton of drama here to be honest but I'll toss it again just in case she thinks otherwise I think Sun's apology seems a little fishy just saying it was an oversight and he wasn't ",
        "3": "planning on doing this I don't know it just feels like then what were you planning to do and why are you shifting all the blame to your to your team I I I think there is some drama behind the scenes here Wendy I'm with I am with you on this one but when I was reading the story I was thinking like isn't isn't it for everyone whales and not whales I know that we don't want whales to come in and dominate you know these different crypto ecosystems because we're just perpetuating the issues we're trying to solve in the real world but how do we solve it is it for people like CZ to come in and just say you're not allowed to do this I feel like Wendy that goes against a lot of things that you say well so that's the thing is like operating in a true decentralized economy I don't get to tell you and you don't get to tell me but I guess like we still get to tell each other like this is wrong don't do this but we can't necessarily enforce it so I guess if CZ goes in and actually enforces it it does does kind of go against that aspect but at the same time he does run a centralized exchange so there is a difference between centralization and decentralization also too I don't know ",
        "4": "the laws behind any of this depending on whatever regions binance operates because I'm not a binance user because I'm in the US as of now but again I may relocate to Bermuda because of consensus anyways um but I I mean even though I don't necessarily like people telling each other what to do but CZ is kind of looking out for the underdog so I kind of like that and I guess we just have to see how the story plays out I mean you're right about that last bit we definitely have to see what happens I'm curious to see what happens following the sweet midnight launch and who becomes the big player over there that's for sure but yeah I mean I don't know man there's also a little bit of layer one fatigue out there in the world I think people are sort of being like hey you know ethereum's looking pretty good with these updates they seem to be sort of assembling power on that chain and yet we have these upstarts who are saying hey for XYZ reasons we're going to be better at making this work for the mainstream and ",
