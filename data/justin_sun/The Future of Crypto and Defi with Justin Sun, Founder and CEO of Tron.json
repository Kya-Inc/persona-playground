        "0": "[Music] what is up everybody i'm scott melker and this is the wolf of wall street's podcast today's guest is the founder and ceo of tron which is one of 2017's largest icos raising 70 million dollars and to this day is still a top 20 cryptocurrency by market cap there's also a lot more to justin than just trx justin sun's one of the most well-known individuals in the crypto space and is by all definitions in og i'm looking forward to dissecting his thoughts on bitcoin's recent rise better understanding the current state of defy and all coins and getting his insider perspective on regulation in the united states china and all around the world justin thank you so much for coming on the show yes thank you thank you so much so before we get into the questions once again this is the wolf of all streets podcast for twice a week i talked to your favorite personalities from the world of bitcoin finance trading art music sports and politics the show is powered by block works group a media company with over 20 podcasts their network you can check them out at blockworksgroup.io and if you like the podcast follow me on twitter you can check out my website join my newsletter you can do both those things ",
        "1": "at the wolf of all streets dot io this episode is sponsored by voyager and sovereign stay tuned for more information on both later in the episode so justin i don't know if you know this but uh i also went to the university of pennsylvania um i i interviewed kevin wang recently from nervous who all nervous who also went there do you know anyone else in crypto space who went to penn yeah um so from from my years because i went to penn uh around like 2011. so uh so what most of my classmates these days is work for like jpp morgan morgan stanley like goldman sachs doing like traditional investment banking stuff um for entrepreneur i don't think i really know uh someone uh who is in my age doing like uh startups but of course as we know uh like uh three person uh is all from penn uh elon musk warren buffet and donald ",
        "2": "trump yeah of course everybody knows that and i i went there in the 1990s so i'm a little bit older than you but uh and the other one was michael milken who went to jail for financial crimes he was the other famous one when i was there um so yeah it's interesting i had a very similar experience honestly everyone i went to school with ended up on wall street and uh not that many went went uh the entrepreneur around except for of course elon musk who was there right before me so um so so we have we have that in common so let's talk a bit about um your background like i said you tron was one of the biggest and most popular and hyped icos in 2017. what what were you doing before that and what made you decide to launch tron yes definitely um so before we launch tron uh in 2012 i get into the crypto space uh i think the first company i work for uh is ripple so i help reporter develop ",
        "3": "their uh great china community uh and uh um uh we i'm with repo in those like very early days uh around 2013 uh 2014 2015 uh and then at that time uh ripple uh the chairman chris larson uh and also idg capital uh invest me uh to develop the first blockchain company in china and then i also managed to develop the first live streaming platform in china so and also um um the team these days is also developed like the life just recently is also kind like popular in united states and turkey so it's very active now uh and then um in 2017 we ",
        "4": "decided to start tron i think the original idea uh is trying to solve the signalability problem on ethereum so um so which is what we do today so yeah so we have been like working on improving the scalability problem on the blockchain industry uh for quite a long time and uh and i think right now we we start to see some programs right so like uh i think we will cover later like like usdt or tron is extremely popular and we um provide lots of alternatives for the people in the blockchain industry to move their coins in a very fast instant speed and zero fee which is as you said you were thinking about this in 2016 2017 when you ico ",
        "5": "and maybe because there was a bear market and crypto had sort of this downtime the problem didn't come into focus as it has this year but now we see this defy explosion and anyone who's moved money around on ethereum or has participated in uniswap sees these insane gas fees right so now we finally really see the problem that you were looking to fix years ago exactly yeah exactly and i believe um have a very good um basically instant and almost zero transaction fee blockchain is extremely important for our industry so i can give you like the data so so basically uh a few years ago when uh usdt is only available on only at that time it's not it's not even available on ethereum it's only available on omni the usdt transaction per day is only 8 ",
        "6": "000 8000 so after it developed on ethereum it grow to around 200k per day so uh today on trump is almost 500k per day uh uh and i i believe it's got gonna grow to uh uh way above one million transaction per day very soon so if for example if right now today's uh um usdt transaction is around like 800 so it's already 100 times more than uh we have two years ago and i believe yeah in in the future it's gonna grow to like uh uh 80 million transactions per day maybe in the next two years and i believe this is really like the machine who is driving the bull markets uh right ",
        "7": "now imagine if you uh um today you you you can only still use omni it takes you like half a day to transact the usdt it is impossible for like traders hedge fund like all different kind of the uh uh fund manager to create a crypto uh uh between different changes uh in the first place so that's why i believe if we really have a very good infrastructure for the blockchain uh instance b zero fee our value not only trump but also like bitcoin ethereum all the assets on blockchain platform uh we we have uh like even like tenfold like 100 volt this kind of the uh increase potential uh if our uh blockchain is really resilient instant and almost zero feet yeah that that makes perfect sense so ",
        "8": "i'm curious now we're seeing so many stable coins right i mean the usdt is 24 billion dollars of a trillion dollar crypto market cap it's become a much smaller part of the ecosystem even though as you said it is fundamental to the way that people move money i'm curious how you think the emergence of these other stable coins affects that and also if you have any concerns about tether in general i don't but i know that there's always the the inevitable fud around it and the the case in the in new york and such yeah exactly so i believe like uh when you offer like product you want to offer like different kind of the uh good product so that's why i think this year um so we also uh collaborate with uh tusd already so to issue uh geo on tosd on tron i believe this is gonna be available uh uh at the end of q1 uh uh i believe qsd ",
        "9": "gonna release qsd on tron i believe on these days um for example qsd usdc uh dear advantage is they have um the instant fiat on ramp i don't know if you tried usdc and the tusd before so right now on sewer gate and um so you can instantly uh deposit us dollar and get like one usdc and one tusd uh so they have basically instant vr ram uh for these two uh stablecoin uh and of course uh usdt i don't have that if you want to mean usct you need to wire the money so it's take you like two or three days um um so that's why i believe so different kind of the um stable coin target different kind of the markets ",
        "10": "right sure but uh i believe like even on the the tether growth gonna benefit from usdc and usd uh for example even myself sometimes i use um tusd and the ustc as a ramp to swap to the um usdt in the first place so i i actually did that today because somebody required usdc i had usdt and yeah exactly exactly so so that's why um um i believe this is kind of like the um the future roadmap so we're gonna have lots of the uh stablecoin uh for example uh uh i believe um uh facebook gonna issue their time right sure so i think i'm gonna be available for everybody so uh we i think we are happy to even collaborate with them to uh deliver like time from blockchain ",
        "11": "so i think we we want to like serve all the stablecoin issuers and to provide the best infrastructure support for them do you have any concerns about the tether situation whether it's backed whether there'll be legal trouble and whether that could affect the market in any discernible way yeah i i read the interview and the podcast of paulo uh recently uh so uh um um so i think he uh uh um basically uh um focus on um um address those concerns i think heather from their um the information they release is one to one backed and also um tether is also uh trying really hard to compliant with all the regulators even we all know they have some lawsuits they need to settle ",
        "12": "but i i believe heather is in a better situation at least compared to two years and uh one year ago i i think they have to be and then and that and that sort of uh i guess segues into the next obvious topic which is regulation and you worked at ripple you see what's going on obviously and there was immediately rumors that trx was next right uh which maybe was just a result of one person on twitter i i don't know and and you immediately addressed it but uh that specific situation aside how much concern do you have about you know heavy-handed regulation particularly from i guess the united states and china in the future and our space in general i guess you can speak specifically to tron but how it could affect you know crypto as a whole yes definitely when i first like joined the company uh uh uh in 2013 ",
        "13": "uh i believe even at that time the uh regulation is is also always a big topic in in our industry uh i remember at that time on 2013 um the chairman of the bitcoin foundation uh got arrested because of the like money laundry problem in bit instant i don't know if you know those time is only almost seven years so i wasn't there but i'm good friends with charlie schramm so i've heard the stories many times yeah exactly so um so so that's why i mean at that time right we only have like very few crypto exchange uh regulation is already become like uh uh uh like a a topic in in the industry so that's why i think when i first started uh tron uh i think we we uh always invest a lot of the ",
        "14": "money and uh energy into um regulation so for our like ico uh we we do like all the kyc to prevent like u.s customer uh and also um ascension countries from participate in in the ico and also of course we didn't um sell to like any u.s citizens um on the ico and we doing a lot of things to we hire like very prestigious law firm uh right like uh uh legal memo in very early days uh and also of course we um deliver the product uh even before we we launched the tokens so which eliminates the uh security risk of trx so that's why i believe trx is one of the like many uh uh crypto currencies uh are really ",
        "15": "focused on try to be like compliant uh in both like u.s and china uh and we uh we are very confident on that so as i like already say in twitter so we have never been like even asked by any like regulators about like the trx or anything around globe and also of course as you see uh recently uh ibd we have lots of good relationship with chinese government for example like i i was recently hired by uh the chinese state's reform uh reform commission uh um the information uh magazine as a board of director so to advise on how to develop the blockchain industry ",
        "16": "in china and also we are happy to collaborate with all the governments around the globe because i believe blockchain is some kind of the technology improve everybody's situation it's not like uh ai right so ai maybe pull somebody out of job you know because right machine countdown people's job but i think blockchain gonna like for example if you can wire money from uh for example china to united states in like one second right it benefits lots of people benefits the whole society and not even like mentioning blockchain actually has lots of other user cases for example um if like all the people in united states is using uh this kind of the um blockchain id right so uh there won't be like dispute on the um on the votes right so ",
        "17": "everybody gonna like vote with a valley id right so so and also like everybody can get access to their votes status by uh their digital id i mean which is uh um basically uh um very common in the blockchain industry right but there's no um people um right now they don't really know like blockchain industry actually can even change the vote system right so that's why i believe uh blockchain industry will have uh a numerous like use case uh and and this is like one of the most like revolutionary technology we have in uh um 21st century i believe so so definitely i we can see the huge potential and not even mentioning like recently occ um um announced like the they allow like banks to start to move ",
        "18": "uh their money on the blockchain which i think is amazing because blockchain is designed to replace swift to swift is uh a it's very old it's like it's like almost like it's something from world war ii you know it's so funny that they call it swift when it's so slow exactly exactly so you can't imagine like i i believe swift is some of the technology is um basically invented around world war ii and still be like used for everybody today you know so uh um um and i believe you know this is really the time uh uh we can get something to replace like swift to provide this kind of the 24 like seven uh money transaction experience ",
        "19": "to the people around the globe so um so some people like they they tell me like when they move like usdt on trunk uh um uh compared to like the the real life they're gonna move money right from china to u.s from swift that the difference is huge you know so what once they use like cryptocurrency they can't even get get back to the real life it's like the difference of like being in an old train and putting coal in the engine and now like flying flying on a flying on a private jet it really is that big of a difference and it's it's really it's it's really pretty crazy and i think another you know important use case or another downside of swift is not only how slow it is but you can't send a small amount of money for the wire transaction the fees the timing it's if you want to send five dollars from china to the united states you can't do that with a bank exactly so which make even like charity ",
        "20": "uh charitable donation is impossible right so everybody wants to like donate five like one dollar uh to like a charity uh foundation like in like africa but the problem is if the transaction fee is like ten dollars is only like uh feasible if you want to donate like about like 1 000 which already eliminate like 99 percent of the people right so not like everybody have like a spare like 1 000 to donate right people only have like one uh one dollar five dollars uh i read like um a thesis about like this kind of the cherokee donation actually like 99 99 percent of the people is small like donor and and also um actually for siri um people encourage a small amount donor because a small amount donor they can ",
        "21": "consistently make those donations right so like one dollar per per week right so everybody can donate for like a year so not only i think this is more like um benefits like the charity course but also uh i believe this really enables this kind of the brotherhood between different kind of countries because if you right now if you see like most of the uh charitable uh uh activities is only happen domestic uh there is no like international right even uh even like very large like foundations um when they try to respond like internationally it's very hard so that's why i believe like blockchain also has uh tremendous like user cases in uh charity as well i told you that's actually i've never heard that in ",
        "22": "all the conversations that i've had about it and it's so true i could you know if if there's a hurricane or a or an earthquake outside of the united states every time if you're in the united states you want to donate you basically have to do it to the red cross and you know that that money is being wasted or and you know that and and like you said people are giving five dollars you know text your five dollar donation you know that money is being wasted and not getting there immediately or to the place it's needed it's really a brilliant use case that i never uh gave much thought to so back to uh you brought up an interesting point about the occ um they've said now that banks can custody bitcoin uh crypto assets and and as you said they've now said that they can use stable coins basically to move money so just playing devil's advocate right we know that stable coins are better we know that uh that the blockchain is the answer but should we fear that the banks are taking it over and it's becoming sort of a gover government tool as opposed to what it ",
        "23": "was before which was a free way for us to move money outside of the banking system exactly um so for for myself uh i want to like collaborate with everybody uh uh um even for like those banks i want to collaborate with them because i believe like different kind of the person have like different kind of the needs so uh for example um i can give like uh give you a very good example for um for actually like like uh even like the institution banks can benefit what we call like rebels right this kind of the crypto uh world a lot of um by like great scale so basically when first like great scale design is only like offered to um to like basically regulated money to invest into the crypto in the first place so that's why ",
        "24": "when first grade scale invented there is now not a lot of people use great scale to uh invest in the first place because you know for the rebels they they want to like basically hide their money right so they won't go through like gbtc to to buy btc and that they don't believe in gbdc in the first place because they believe this is like paper bitcoin right i want to hold my bitcoin in my wallet right but there is a numerous amount of the font like like like a pension fund like uh uh they they can only invest like uh um um basically the gbtc or etf right yeah so that's why when those institutions find out wow gbtc is a really good vehicle to invest like bitcoin the bitcoin price pumped dramatically because of institution money so recently like a lot ",
        "25": "of like hedgehog hedge fund and also a lot of the regulated money uh uh asked me like where to buy btc uh i all refer them to buy from from from gbtc even they have to pay like 20 40 like the premium but still this is the only way right so so so so so that's why i believe um um a lot of the regulated money and events can really benefits the like the blockchain industry on too um for stable one i believe this is the same so uh eventually like when uh um um people can move like us dollar freely right on tron on ethereum other blockchain platform it's gonna dramatically uh increase the people's interest on blockchain and of course on cryptocurrency assets so so that's why uh i always believe ",
        "26": "like more people come to our world uh the better so even some people right they have different kind of the risk preference right some people they can only invest like in a regulated way so for example like so today for usdt you don't need to get your address like regis register right in like any kind of the platform you can transfer them like anonymously right um i believe in the future right bank may even have some like for example they collaborate with tosd usdc you you might need to even have like every address you transact from their platform kyc you know which is obviously is uh it's not like a good thing for the crypto world but i believe for example like wells fargo if they want to get on tron platform they need to get all their uh um customer trauma addresses kyc on wells fargo ",
        "27": "platform right for example right but i think this is a good thing right so at least all the wells fargo customers can move money on the blockchain in the future right yeah yeah so then i guess the next inevitable question is central bank digital currencies uh i mean you're you're in hong kong obviously um but you know china is experimenting with the digital one i think that that is the obvious future so should we have concern for our stable coins when governments issue their own and try to you know obviously compete with the dollar with their own digital currencies yes um i think dcep right now is kinda like uh more like uh test it uh inside of china uh right now i don't think like dcep uh wants to move like internationally uh uh because you know china have this kind of the currency control right so you can't like move ",
        "28": "money um from china to outside of china basically so i think dcep will be first tested um domestically so uh and i hope like one day uh um dcep can also move like uh internationally so uh that's that's my hope and uh some of the uh um trunk members so basically they designed like tron um protocol before uh uh they now like work for this ep so that's why i i know like saw some of the inside stories in dcp so uh uh so i i may sometimes i i even joke like uh you can just ask like dcep to use like tron solutions you know yeah if you're building it anyways exactly you don't need to review it right so that's something ",
        "29": "you guys design in the first place so so that's why i believe uh eventually uh i think dcep will be same as time right usdt uh turc like usdc right so it's just like they they're gonna compete with one another just like today you know like us dollar compete with chinese rent compete with japanese yen compete with like korean one right so all different kind of the uh currency gonna compete with one another and uh the people who love to use them gonna choose like one over another four different kind of reasons right so hopefully it won't be still a threat to the ones that we're used to using we'll have the freedom and we'll have more people who are comfortable with transacting digitally and hopefully it'll be bullish for bullish for everyone so i want to go back to obviously something we touched on earlier which is a huge hot topic ",
        "30": "conversation defy right uh and and as you said um i think it's clear that ethereum is having trouble scaling um you know i've heard people like in ethereum to sort of like a world computer from the 1980s um that you know it's extremely slow obviously it can't handle the transaction therefore gas fees are extremely high so now we've seen the interest in d5 explode what does defy look like now in 2021 and moving forward as it matures and as companies like yours come up with solutions to the clear problems that we're seeing now yes definitely i believe leave ethereum prove the potential of d5 in 2020 right so um even i mean tron get into d5 like very early in uh so base uh basically uh trying to ethereum both started d5 in 2020 uh also sorry in 2018 ",
        "31": "so after two years development people start to believe in defy so in 2018 nobody believed in defy in the first place right very hard to convince people to get into defy industry but i think 2020 uh everybody starts you to believe defy is is basically a very good use case for uh a lot of things uh um for example like uh all kind of the different uh uh small tokens is trading on union swap and just swap these days rather than even some like various more uh uh uh tokens which we call like coin focus exchanges right uh and also um a lot of people starting to swap their uh stable coin on curve instead of trading on like cumberland like um finance like a lot of the big ",
        "32": "exchanges and also uh um i believe ethereum also come to a very big problem which is scalability problem in 2020 so before that people didn't like realize this is like like a very um uh a big problem we need to deal with it now right so but after like 2020 i i believe everybody in the industry think the transaction fee is insane even these days i don't know if you notice like kraken even charge people for deposit money uh into the cracking exchange uh i believe in the future even more um because you know blockchain gonna grow anyway so um so that's why i think people gonna i think in the future like uh coinbase finance may even in the future gonna charge money for you deposit money into ",
        "33": "um ethereum uh uh in the ethereum network like erc20 like usdt usdc all the stable coin and different kind of tokens you need to pay like a deposit fee right which is kind like crazy but uh but exchange have cost on that because every people you deposit they need to sweep the coin into the exchange addresses costs cost them lots of money right so right now these days sometimes transaction is a hundred dollars so that's why yeah i i believe like this kind of layer two solution or like layer one solution like trunk are really going to play a very important role in 2021 for example i i can give you some example like usct on trunk um of course it's the first thing and then i think second uh you can see like uh uh jazz swap ",
        "34": "and also uh um uh and just stable like this is all like the um uh a compound maker dow and the union swap on trunk are really um we have seen a huge like use case on those um um platform as well people really start to realize uh importance um of the tron uh ecosystem and we're gonna unleash the um d5 so for example i can give you some examples yeah today like for you if you want to trade on a union swap you can't trade even like for example if you want to do like one thousand dollars trade it's not worth it even right you need a vlog right yeah yeah i did i i literally went on there quickly because i just wanted to do tether to usdc or something like i said earlier i was just trying to quickly do ",

        "45": "move their balance sheet on bitcoin to reserve it's more like it's not for short-term period of trading right it's for reserve you know it's like it is like gold you know it's not like uh for for for short-term trading so that's why make me feel like this is like fundamental you know and also for like ethereum and also for tron i believe there's uh a huge amount of the growth in the fundamental in the first place so um for example in 2017 uh we didn't see like much like application developed on ethereum and and on trunk right in the in the first place ethereum is only for ico right so which make is like uh uh only for the volatility something like that but in 2021 we seen like ethereum like as i said ",
        "46": "right tbl is like uh 20 billion dollars something is even more than what is syrian are worse uh in the future i believe right yeah so uh um and for trunks the same story uh we have over uh uh 12 billion dollars right uh uh um 12 billion dollars seat on the platform uh and our market cap is only around three billion dollars so it's even four times more than the the money we hold you know so that's why i believe for a lot of the product in our industry this time i think the growth is based on fundamentals instead of bubble the people who who's still talking about bibles because they really don't understand what's going on in the industry i believe in the first place and also i'm super bullish about this year and also for the future ",
        "47": "the reason is because uh uh i believe uh um um there's always gonna be a lot of the innovations i can give you some examples when 2015 when alibaba go ipo on on new york stock exchange everybody believes even the e-commerce war is ended in china so alibaba gonna be dominated uh in china but uh uh but recently you you know there is a company called the pdd chinese name is pindor it is uh start you grow like dramatically they have lots of fans in the united states for those traders you know because pindordo is grown like uh a hundred times a year you know uh it's become like one of the biggest opponents to alibaba on for only for two years of growth so that's why i believe for um crypto industry ",
        "48": "is same as the e-commerce we're gonna always have all the opportunities so the the always the secret recipe for the competition is always uh serve your customer with the best experience uh with the low cost for them you know that that's the only way uh there is no like something like you can dominate the markets forever right i think this is for ethereum as well right uh if the ethereum uh can't like solve this kind of security problem like tron gonna take over right if we can't solve the signal ability problem if one day we have the same problem a new blockchain gonna take over trunks so i believe this kind of the competition will always uh exist uh i i think like uh uh nobody is immune from from this kind of the competition so that's why i believe as as one of the ",

        "63": "uh i believe all the uh good crypto currency uh ecosystem gonna survive eventually uh with extremely large market cap uh for example um like because i'm an early tesla investor in 2012 uh so at that time tesla price is also extremely low right but the i mean tesla have the same volatility compared to bitcoin right more yeah exactly it's also so um so but if you always hold tesla don't like trade with leverage uh and the margin you may get like liquidated but if you always hold the tesla stock you we um if you see in this in two year five year return it's give you like a very good return uh eventually you know yeah so it's about believing and will you know you can basically ignore all of that but that ",
