        "1": "get your free slushie that's one word of advice for today 7-eleven go get your free slushie we are on coin market cap rank 141 which is you know it's moving up and crypto bubble has us at negative eight percent today rank is going back up to 155 here the price is 38 and 51 cents i have been watching this all day and there's some dramatic drop it seems like the hype for this whole nft stuff has definitely been gone it's it's out the door it's been like maybe going on two weeks right now that little hype has definitely gathered some new interest but you know maintaining it is a whole different story netspace currently is at 22.5 eib's and i want to show you guys something really interesting so a week ago we were upping these numbers 148 000 and around this time 1.4 came out and i'll give them that if it went down or people just shutting off their farms because they opened up or created new wallets to try to get these nfts and then boom and just drop back because ",
        "2": "people didn't win and all 10 000 nfts were given out but this obviously came back and it was fluctuating a little bit maybe people were trading or you know they they finally came back online so look at this as of today we're back in here we're low guys 144 539 nodes and that's what's currently happening with the note count right now you can see all this my days to win is still 19 it went actually went back down i see 22.5 on the gui right now so here on dexi i wanted to point out something that was really shocking to me and i learned about it you know a couple days ago and i didn't do a video but look look at this ranked one right so this is the gene whatever you want to call it uh number 9098 offering for 108 i mean 808 xch that is not a small price to pay but let me show you guys something on here is it this this was posted july 10th all right so that was yesterday a little over a week ago chia project launches nft ",
        "3": "standard kickstarting entire ecosystem of creators marketplace two providers and of course fans tonight an nft on chia sold for over usd 12 000 equivalent to 300 xch the price went down a little bit so it's a little less than that now for the first time it's most rich here friend which is the gene i don't know what the name of these things are but i guess they just call them by the numbers it's 11 400 now compared to what it was a few days ago which was 12 000 so as the price comes down obviously this value of this nft is going to be worth a little less but now they're trying to flip it for 808 xch which is crazy in my opinion so i did mention about justin's son and i wanted to show you guys this justin sun says he's ready to spend 5 billion acquisition as crypto firms struggle and of course we all know about the current situation so why i wanted to mention here and this obviously it's just my speculation i'm just throwing news out ",
        "4": "there and it could be a possibility i'm just saying because right now you guys know of the celsius issue they're falling for bankruptcy you got three arrows and you got all these other crypto firms struggling right now especially the smaller ones and justin's son is coming out and saying that you know he'll spend 5 billion on acquisitions that's crypto firms struggle to i guess uplift them buy them over take them over whatever it is one thing i wanted to point out is bram is not too fond of justin so why am i quarreling these two together i'm just saying and i just wanted to point something out like what happens if chia is struggling and they're looking for people to fund it and justin's son just happens to be there again and i say again because i'm going to show you why and here you can see bram is really not fond of justin justin's son is scummier than you expect even when you take into account that he's scummier than you expect that was a pretty funny tweet you know right here it actually describes the whole thing like why did bram if he created a bittorrent sell-off to justin sun well he bram here is saying that he ",
        "5": "was just a small minority shareholder by the time the sales happened this was the sale that he's talking about bittorrent is selling for 140 million to justin sun and his blockchain startup tron we hear a lot about bram and his history of victorian how he created that and his association from the beginning now he distanced himself from that but they always bring back his history about him creating bittorrent and how that all began but he no longer is a part of that just so you guys are aware and justin sun has been i don't i mean you can say shady you can say that he's like the most evil person in the world with all this money unfortunately they have all this wealth but they somehow acquired it you know however you want to put it anyway so i'm just imagining if chia obviously gets below to a certain price point and you know just so happens that there's these evil guys with a lot of money willing to take it over and it just becomes that right sort of like how elon ",
        "6": "is like about to purchase twitter they put them through this whole thing and now they're trying to have like legal actions against him suing him because he failed to commit to it i don't know it's just a whole bunch of things and i'm just kind of speculating on it i mean it's interesting to read and then put one in one together of course there's no official news on that but it's the crypto space right it's chia justin's son had history with bram in regards to bittorrent i'm pretty sure that justin is aware of chia and maybe eyeing it somehow all right if he has hope that chia can be the next bitcoin quote-unquote all right guys i want to thank you guys for always being here please remember to hit that like comment and subscribe and i'll see you guys again soon bye "
