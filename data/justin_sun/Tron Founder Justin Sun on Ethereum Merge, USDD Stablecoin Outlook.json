        "0": "proof work is kind of like essential to ethereum even most of the people complain about like high gas fee very slow transaction but i still believe proof of work actually basically provide a very good foundation for ethereum infrastructure which as we all know um today is over around 60 billion um dollars worth of crypto assets on ethereum all guarded by uh approval of work so that's why i believe uh we still uh need a chance to keep proof of work for uh ethereum in the future so that's why i support uh proof of work for ecrm so justin you know we look at the price of eth over the past uh you know several months obviously it's down significantly nonetheless it seems to have rebounded with this successful merges or successful signs that the mergers were going to the merge was ",
        "1": "going to happen doesn't this kind of say at least that the market sort of favors here proof of stake um that it doesn't necessarily want proof of work for ethereum um you know again you're bringing up that whole thing about the the the excessive amounts of costs to to do transactions there yes uh first of all i'm a poor uh proof of stake uh protocol funder so i founded trunk in 2017 and trung is a proof of stake network so we have like down provo stake like five years ahead of ecrn but i still think a smart contract with a proof of work is actually essential to the whole crypto industry because after ethereum moved to proof of stake i think the whole proof-of-stake um ecosystem will be furious like tron bic ethereum ",
        "2": "avalanche like solana is all a proof of stake based uh blockchain protocol but for um proof of work uh only bitcoin basically i mean monero like z cash uh but none of them is like smart contract base so that's why i believe a smart contract-based uh proof of work uh which is um ethereum like uh ethw post merge are probably going to be the best choice for developers if they still want to develop something new on um easier certainly a money maker oh go ahead lawrence yeah why is it better for developers first of all i think at least for um i think 50 percent of the crypto communities still believe ",
        "3": "proof of work is safer and more decentralized than provo stake uh especially i think among uh those people favor like bitcoin and really favor like mining and also um the algorithm developed by satoshi uh i think they have this kind of the tradition uh they trust proof of work um network uh they favor approval work network more than pos network uh i think that's the first part of the um logic here and the second part i think is because there is a very large minor based community you know i think today um all the equipment invests on mining ethereum is over 10 billion us dollars and also they have developed a very sophisticated uh mining machine for uh all the approval work ",
        "4": "network so that's why i believe a new approval work network will also rely on those uh very mature infrastructure building by miner for the past 10 years i want to touch on that last point that you made there you know miners this is a huge industry for them and how they make their living miners produced over 620 million dollars worth of ether in july alone according to some coin s data that we have and so a lot of prominent chinese miners are proposing this hard fork because you know they still want to continue to support this new proof-of-work version of the chain that could theoretically keep their financial activity intact and vitalik buterin the founder of ethereum over uh the past week at eth soul was saying that ethw proponents are just trying to make a quick buck is that a valid comment ",
        "5": "yes uh first of all for poloniex to support um east fork it's not for profit at all because currently um the eths and the ethw uh trade on poloniex is all zero trading fee and also um ethw is now prime so if italic and i like everyone in the world will get equivalent amounts of the airdrop basically hard fork you know uh in the network so there's no like any developers or leaders making more like ethw than other people so that's why i think at least for uh poloniex to support its work i think it's just for building a pow solution for ethereum network i think that's for us and also for miner uh obviously i think there is a big uh difference ",
        "6": "on italic and basically serum foundation and minor uh miner believe they contribute a huge um contribution to ethereum system but obviously syrian developers don't see this as a contribution right but i think eventually we can have like a two network uh proof of work ether network and the proof of stake network compete together so uh we we will know right uh which one market favor the most pro of stake or approval work so uh justin what's this about usdd uh being the first uh stable coin that will be on the proof of work uh ethereum system what exactly is that about yeah sure i think the usdd is the first stable coin to announce to support proof of work ecr network ",
        "7": "post merge so i think right now you know most of the protocol and d5 protocol in the world uh they don't support uh ethereum proof of work post merge so that's why i think uscd uh trump-based stablecoin and also um aprt which is nfd platform uh we all want to be the first uh solution when everybody use ecrm approval work uh post-merge period of time so i i gotta ask you for this because i mean obviously and you've probably been asked this a bunch of times but look we had ust that was a big fiasco we've had a bunch of issues with algorithmic stable coins they the general model seems to be a complete mess because it relies and for the most part this idea that there will be demand for balancers etc uh to keep to keep it going that ",
        "8": "essentially usdd or ust or any kind of stablecoin algorithmic stablecoin is basically a ponzi usdd lost its peg last month it went down to like you know 94 cents or so why should anybody use a algorithmic stablecoin after you know this kind of a massive fiasco that that took 60 billion dollars of value out of the markets and almost overnight yes first of all i think yes um so first of all i believe ust and luna manage their treasury and the stable quant badly so basically it's just like um the central bank of zimbabwe you know um they manage their fear like in a terrible way which the um the value of the network and the token itself collapsed like dramatically uh i think in may um but i think decentralized stable ",
        "9": "point right just like usdd's name decentralized u.s dollar i think it's still essential to our industry because as we all know all the component of d5 today is so decentralized right we have decentralized um oracle decentralized smart contract and also ethereum like trunk like all the native tokens decentralized but only one part is um most of the time is centralized is stable coin so that's why i believe we need finish the last component of d5 protocol and basically change it to decentralize that's why i think um in the algorithm itself for um the stable coin it's just probably only 10 of the component to keep the decentralized stable coin stable we have lots of other mechanism we can ",
        "10": "use to keep the stable coin stable for example recently we launched psm which is also very common maker um basically allow users to use uh regulated centralized stablecoin like usdt usdc on two mint um decentralized stable coin and also the same time we will still have different crypto assets used as over collateralized assets for the stablecoin for example today usdd you have btc trx and also usdt and the usdc as a collateralized assets for the u.s stable point um usd yes i know but ust allegedly you know they they went on a buying spree for a bunch of bitcoin as a potential collateral but of course the price of bitcoin was falling um so you know if ",
        "11": "you have an unstable uh collateral backing a stable coin doesn't that sort of create this this conflict as to uh whether or not you can maintain its peg yes i think first of all it is very important to keep over collateralized uh all the time so i think right now uh usdd of course we are 300 over collateralized uh which was is very healthy but i think it's still very important i think at least in my understanding to keep the cloud lights ray over 110 overall i think that's the first thing so obviously ust is super undercollateralized right they only have probably like 20 percent um colonization rate for the stablecoin they are holding i think that's the first thing and the second thing of course i think it's just like uh central bank of china central bank of ",
        "12": "hong kong you need to hold uh different uh club collateralized assets by the same time you need to manage in a good way right so that's why i think central bank holding uh gold and other assets uh like like central bank mas in singapore and they also hold different investments but also you always need to invest like wisely right that's also the problem of like luna they invest bitcoin in a very high price which basically realizes a huge loss when like bitcoin gold stock so that's why i think if we really want to use other assets as a collateral as i said you also need to buy in a small um smart move right so basically buy it in a cheap price which can always make the uh overall central bank to make money yeah all right i'm still a little skeptical i mean you ",
        "13": "know i'm not sure i usdd has already pegged so you never know i don't know with the down markets and the uncertainty with these balancer tokens and they're keeping their value it is quite risky nevertheless i want to get your take on how long do you think this crypto winter will last and are we in a crypto winter yes sure first of all um i think we're definitely in a crypto winter so not only i think uscd4 to d-pack to 94 even usdc usdt as a um centralized stablecoin also went down um i think uh usdt's went down to um 92 percent on finance and the usdc also went down to 95 cents in finance as well at that time so that's why i think all the stable coin even goes down because the marquee i think feel ",
        "14": "super panic at that time i believe um right now i think at least in short period of time i will say in one to three months right now we are still in a small bull run because right now federal reserve uh um they they won't get a hike interest in at least two months and also um for the market itself i think since the leverage in a very long time so right now i think that's why we see um the price increase right since uh i think right now everything is just recovered from the the leverage um but i think still in the next like six to 12 months i think we still in the bull markets we need to prepare like more cash you know prepare for enough cash flow if you are building business and also if you are investors i still believe this is not time you should like ",
