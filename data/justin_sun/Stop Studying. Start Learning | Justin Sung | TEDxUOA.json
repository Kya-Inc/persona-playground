        "0": "[Music] thank you I want to be a doctor so when I was 17 I entered pre-med it's famously competitive so I studied a lot at this routine wake up at seven for lectures study until 12 a.m and then repeat every day one day I was sitting on the couch at Uni and this guy from my class walks in and he says so tired I studied until 2 A.M and I thought this guy studied more than me so I went all out I started studying 20 hours a day every day for nine months I used to rub breath mints on my eyelids to keep me awake which I do not recommend so what was my result ",
        "1": "well I got perfect grades and I got into medical school I also had a mental breakdown because it turns out that sleep is rather important but the funny thing is that when I entered medical school the content doubled so my strategy of studying 20 hours a day wasn't going to cut it and studying 40 hours a day seemed challenging and I wanted to enjoy my life too so I had a problem my methods got me excellent results at what cost I tackled this in the nerdiest way possible for the following several years I read thousands of papers on learning I adjusted my techniques daily and I taught what I'd learned to the students I was tutoring at the time too so I saw how it worked for me and for my students I was so obsessed that I ended up going back to UNI after finishing medical school to do my Master's in education and I realized that this cycle of ",
        "2": "working hard and getting inconsistent results and then feeling anxious and then compensating by working even harder this is common and avoidable a few years ago I actually left my job as a medical doctor to teach these skills full-time now I work with thousands of people from over 100 countries teaching them to learn more efficiently so here's what I know now that just change the game studying is not the same thing as learning studying is like reading a book or writing some notes I haven't learned it until that knowledge is in your head and you can use it and there's different levels too for example regurgitating some facts as a lower level than a nuanced discussion or solving complex problems researchers sometimes talk about this as higher order versus lower order learning and different types of studying can ",
        "3": "actually help to generate different orders of learning why does this matter years ago I didn't know about this stuff and I thought I was pretty good at studying after all I got into medical school all that time and effort that I sunk in it's just what you do right you work hard not quite imagine you're driving along and your car breaks down if you're like me you pull over pop the hood take a look and you think I don't know anything about cars if you don't know how the engine works you cannot fix it most people know that learning is a process but what goes on in that process if we don't do well do we know why and how to fix it or do we just guess and Hope causes a lot of anxiety did I study enough no I hope this doesn't come up in the test where did I go wrong why didn't I do well who's had those thoughts before we end up living in fear of learning ",
        "4": "so Step One Is to learn how the engine works become the mechanic of your own brain this thinking about thinking is called metacognition and research shows that those with higher metacognition tend to do better and even if you're not doing better straight away you at least know how you can get better the more you learn the more control you have the less stress you get this builds confidence on the other hand if you have low metacognition just do whatever someone tells you to do this is probably the same thing that your friends are doing the problem is that common methods create common results in my practice I often see students over using flashcards and space repetition it's a common strategy on social media in fact in my pre-med yeah I spent four hours a day every day to cover over 3 000 flashcards but how efficient is it ",
        "5": "when we're trying to juggle multiple subjects at the same time and how effective is it when we need to reach a level to solve complex problems not a lot of research has looked at that and some of the latest research suggests that there are some significant limitations and the majority of people using these approaches are not getting top marks but if that's all you know then taking that away is confronting that's how I felt some people even get defensive like how dare you challenge my main technique on the other side I work with professionals that went through uni this way and they're struggling to learn efficiently while working full-time they're re-certifying they're doing courses they're going back to UNI and they're dreading it so we can avoid problems like this by learning about learning one of the things that's been consistently shown to help improve learning is something called higher order thinking skills now this is hot literally hops ",
        "6": "and higher order thinking is the type of thinking that's needed to help generate this higher order learning those different levels of learning I've been talking about a characteristic feature of higher order learning is that information is integrated not isolated you're always connecting new information to a wider purpose or the bigger picture you're looking for relationships and comparing information against other pieces of information low order learning is isolated it's about memorizing facts and definitions and processes if you do a lot of this learning feels very tedious and irrelevant higher order learning connects information so that your brain sees it as relevant and therefore worth retaining if you learned the same thing with low order learning it's not very connected so our brain doesn't think it's very relevant so we forget it more easily on top of that learning has this ",
        "7": "Snowball Effect the more you know about something the easier it is to learn more about it higher order learning creates networks of knowledge which is a stronger foundation for future learning as you learn more things make more sense and you become more efficient unlike with lower order learning where as you learn more your brain doesn't know what to do with all the isolated New pieces of information and you just get more overwhelmed exams especially at Uni and Beyond test at higher orders more and more so how do we do more higher order learning well unfortunately the research is quite complicated and so there is no agreed on step-by-step guide for higher order learning thank you goodbye uh just kidding fortunately this is one of the main things that I spent years experimenting ",
        "8": "with and teaching the skill is one of the core parts of the work that I do now so here is my step-by-step guide on higher order learning step one was to learn how the engine works improve our metacognition we can start this by tuning into the feeling of lower order versus higher order learning I call this building a radar you know that feeling you get when you're reading something and you think I am not going to remember this you know you're going to have to go over it again and again and again you can feel the information slipping out of your brain who's felt that before your brain is telling you this is irrelevant it's isolated so instead of just saying oh well smashing into our notes to deal with later and staying in that lower order flick up into the higher order and make it relevant so try this start a tally when you study and count how often you get this feeling some of you will realize this is the only feeling you have when you study ",
        "9": "the goal is to reduce this number by about 10 every time you study how step two group information together grouping information forces us to compare and look for relationships to see if it makes sense to group them together but it's not enough just to find relationships and make some groups there are so many ways you could group information together we need to think more deeply and prioritize the relationships so that we form the groups that make the most sense to us so ask yourself how important is this relationship compared to another maybe similar relationship what purpose does it serve often the groups that we will end up forming are different to how it's presented to us in lectures or textbooks and this is normal because the way that we make sense of it is not always the same as the author or the lecturer ",
        "10": "it takes real mental effort to not only find the relationships and the groups but then to decide which relationships and groups are the most important for us but that mental effort is the learning taking place and that back and forth thinking is what higher order learning feels like step one was to build that radar step two was to flick into those higher rotors using groups and relationships step three is to leverage our note taking often the attitude we have towards writing notes is just on the page out of mind we don't really think about it we just dump it in our notes so we feel better who does that I used to spend hours every day studying by writing notes and learn nothing good note-taking should help our brain think not help it avoid thinking ",
        "11": "so don't write notes left to right sequentially down the page I call this linear note taking the problem is that knowledge is not linear so it's very difficult to express groups and relationships with the linear nodes so experiment with some non-linear methods of note taking but even software and apps that can form maps and groups for us can make it too passive we don't want relationships and lines and arrows to appear at the Press of a button we need to think about what groups we want to form whether we want an arrow here even how thick we want to draw the arrow if it's more or less important because that's what higher order learning involves it's rather difficult to do this if someone is speaking to you like in a lecture so I actually recommend practicing with books where you've got time to stop and think I built a complete system using these methods it's an end-to-end method of learning that I train to students as ",
        "12": "young as 12 years old all the way through to people post retirement in their 70s and over the last two years I've collected data on around 5 000 of these students across 120 countries and we've found that those that use these methods are able to reach a level of learning and retention that would normally take them four weeks in just one or two weeks and the important thing is that this is a skill a lot of people say I'm not smart enough or I'm just too old for this after working with so many people I can tell you that this is something that you can train and like any skill that will come more naturally to some but training does make it easier around now usually people will say well Justin it seems like this all takes a lot of time and effort that I already can't afford I can see some of you thinking that right now and you're right which is why most people don't do it in fact there's something called the misinterpreted effort hypothesis it says ",
        "13": "that when we think something takes too much effort we also see it as being ineffective so we stop doing it but research especially around learning shows us that some of the most effective strategies require more effort so avoiding it would be like going to the gym to work out but because the weights take effort to lift we think oh it's not working and we go home but what if it's too hard what if we don't use higher order thinking what then well sure you could cover your content faster but only if we think about studying and not learning in reality what I found is that we waste more time just relearning the things that our brain saw as irrelevant and then forgot it's hard to see how big of a deal this is if we think about studying as just one session on a single afternoon but across weeks of studying that is a lot of wasted time ",
        "14": "it's also very difficult to even reach higher orders of learning if we're mostly thinking in the lower orders so if we need to reach a high level and we don't have time to constantly just relearn things then higher order learning is actually more time efficient so I'll leave you with this don't be like me and just study more we all only have 24 hours in the day so would you rather use it to study want to learn thank you [Applause] [Music] "
