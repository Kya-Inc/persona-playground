        "1": "in like the summer palace so i think we have this original idea uh from uh basically the old uh sodium cats um as a collection yeah i said it's a pretty traditional chinese like uh stuff if everyone wins it's like picking i guess someone will get the idea of it as well but um i also heard that you spent quite a lot of money like 50 million on a bfc like a tron avatar i mean it's a lot of money but like why why um how do you value it like uh why did you buy it yes um so first of all i think enough tea collections become like super popular on these days for most of the hedge fund manager i think they are willing to pay like uh 40 million uh 15 ",
        "2": "million dollars for a picasso or andy warhol uh jackson pollock paintings but i think for our generation like crypto funders uh we uh would rather to spend money on nft avatar uh and also of course uh i'm also a big collector of people park uh those nlt artists work so i think that's just uh represent a different trend of art collection uh in the future and and also of course i think i have key class questions not only have potential on like pvp project we have today like a like punk but also i think uh in terms of like game five combination with uh nft i i think also have lots of potential ",
        "3": "that's why uh we have collaborated with lots of developer team launch ft horse uh which is a derby uh game and also ft hero which is a pvp uh game on trunk are those uh avatar is also in nft uh so i think you also participated like this times like mt berlin's like exhibition so besides like the um zodiacs like you're showing on the background is there any other like uh works you're like are showing so maybe introduce yes yeah yes uh for sure i have lots of uh ift collection uh including uh um people so i have like several uh people's artwork i including uh uh ",
        "4": "including wealth the i think it's the third most expensive uh people's artwork uh is uh basically uh depending on the background of uh green energy and uh really i think try to uh bring everybody's awareness of uh green energy uh and if we didn't succeed on uh the green energy and we will eventually live on the ocean so that's why uh the painting name is called the oceanfront and also i have like several artworks from park which uh um basically the sim is cube so um so basically is i think from one cube to like a thousand cube um you have different ",
        "5": "uh um different set of tube so i think that's like one of the uh collection i've had from park and also uh um i i have some traditional painting as well i have one from picasso and the one from uh committee uh is uh uh basically is a nose so um uh so that's like the traditional uh collection and also i have um several punks and ape uh um basically is a joker theme so uh it it is also my currently my twitter profile yeah so i think one um so when you guys have time you can go downstairs to the cage and there will be like also like really um great connections of like you know the ft works shown by like ",
        "6": "adjusting like this time um my next question is about trunk uh because we we know that tron has involved here to a tron dao and i'm just curious like you know like how do you like value this kind of like model and why you have become like a advocate like for this kind of like dow like um system so curious to know like your opinions yes yeah dao is stand for decentralized autonomous organization so i think this is a a very brand new concept so we can manage like organization in a democratic way so uh basically in trondaw all the trx holders they have a capability to vote and select community notes in the tron ecosystem and all the community nodes together they ",
        "7": "basically will manage like trial network uh which i believe is very um uh uh is very important uh since all the uh votes and the governance process is all happened on the blockchain and executed on the blockchain so you don't need to trust any third party or centralized party the only thing you need to trust is blockchain itself and math itself so that's why um i think this is very important today i think truong uh is we have around we already process over 4 trillion dollars on the blockchain and actually every day i think the daily uh transaction volume is from 10 billion to 5 uh sorry 10 billion to 50 billion dollars every day so i think it is a ",
        "8": "very uh prosperous network about with a democratic governance system so uh and also our user has surpassed 95 million so i think this year we probably we can reach 200 million target so if you want to um know more about tron please visit my twitter or trondon network to learn about uh more of the trial ecosystem yeah thanks um so my next question because like we are in ft berlin so like um ft has also become such a huge attraction like a big topic i think for like such a long time but last year really come to like a peak to some degree so i'm just curious like to hear your opinions on where do you think ft gonna be like in let's say um maybe 10 years from now on how it's ",
        "9": "going to be involved yes for sure i think rft right now has the most of the potential uh is with game five so basically uh you can see uh rft is like a part of the uh equipment or character or avatar in the in any like computer like video games uh we play games all the time but in the past games is all all based on centralized server which means all the data and currency or anything in the game can be altered or can be changed by the system like database operator but based on blockchain today all basically all the character and all the metrics in the game can be fully based on a decentralized ",
        "10": "database which means blockchain like everything will be real on the blockchain and also you can even trade your avatar basically nft with other people so that's why i believe um as long as we are keeping deliver a better game uh it will definitely attract lots of people start you play game and nft on blockchain rather than google play like apple store we are using today so that's like the part i think for the next 10 days nft has the most of the potential if um if you want to predict uh what happened gonna happen in for example 2030 i will believe uh the next generation when they play computer games ",
        "11": "um their character will be real so so you will play the real character and you can even trade um the character with others and they will take all these rules for granted if you tell them there is ever be some game like like the metrics can be changed like any time they won't be basically by default uh things all other things should be based on blockchain okay thanks okay next is a fun fact like i heard like a very um interested in like abating a lot of things like a few years ago you also paid for the charity lunch with buffett and then now like it seems like a pretty into like the spaceship where you baited c is also for like draft basels like the blue origin like a spaceship so if you really get it i really go into the space ",
        "12": "and uh if you do what face you're going to bring and who you're going to bring with you space yes um so yes i will go into space uh in the at the end of this year or early next year uh we haven't decided today but uh should be in q4 this year or q1 next year i i plan to because i have purchased the whole spaceship for six seats so beside myself i can bring five persons with me so currently i'm thinking about bringing one of a member from schwandel community uh and also other forces is for uh people uh in different uh area for example artists uh uh from like nft ",
        "13": "uh and also uh traders uh from crypto world and the uh key opinion leaders from uh uh crypto world and also i also want to uh since i'm right now the ambassador of green data to wto i probably want to bring some of my diplomatic colleague as well with me uh to to the space it's interesting uh okay i think we still have like a um five minutes something like that and then let's just do some like rapid like questions and um just interesting for fun uh so first one just answer very quickly so first one oh no okay hopefully but we'll come back uh yeah okay so describe your daily routine in sweet words um so uh i think i'm ",

        "16": "to deliver a better blockchain product for uh for the crypto community uh i think we're still in uh a rapid development stage um and uh i think get to get rich is not my target i want to get a better product for the community okay so what can be your next big decision that next big plan yes i think the next big plan is usdd decentralized u.s dollar i recently launched on tron ethereum and the bnb chat so we will also expand to other blockchain as well since i really believe our industry need a decentralized us dollar uh which is stablecoin okay one value repair ",
