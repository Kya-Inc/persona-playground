        "0": "justin sun has found the next thing that he's going to copy and it is el salvador and he's talking about crypto at the nation state level inspired by bitcoin as legal tender in el salvador i'm adjusting i'm a justin sun fan he is a contentious fellow he's always sort of you know stirring up controversy around himself and he's trying to sort of get himself into the conversation he's a thick skin he's a smart guy and our colleague roshan talked to him about his grand plans he's leaving tron uh the tron foundation is being dissolved he's going to leave the governance of the tron blockchain to uh to droneholders and other uh other stakeholders and he's going to become an ambassador from the country of grenada to the world trade organization which is some sort of weird signal about where we are in crypto right now and i don't know what it is i think we go a lot of ways in this conversation justin sun remains an interesting character in the crypto space uh i'm gonna throw it straight to will actually because i don't know what are you what are your thoughts when you see this what are you thinking what do you think about this just let's put a big smile on ",
        "1": "my face this morning when i saw that headline that's that's what i'll say right off the bat uh i will also say that if he's dissolving the tron foundation he says he's leaving the uh ecosystem doesn't really make sense because he's still a mega whale in terms of tron and it's a proof of stake system and we've seen in the past that he's been able to go in and change things unchanged on chain just by like the way his tokens kind of vote uh if you remember like the hive debacle from like two years ago brady dale some awesome articles on coindesk you can go back and read those justin soon is like he gets in there he gets into the politics of uh the toronto blockchain quite a bit and i don't see him kind of moving on from that maybe for like six months kind of political stunt and do that uh but that's kind of an aside from from the main story it's interesting to see someone of his figure jumping into like the the political side of things and it makes sense with when you're looking at some of the other players who've been getting into like uh the larger political ecosystem this might be kind of too far off to the ",
        "2": "side but sbf and ftx have just moved to uh the bahamas right and and they moved there just because it's a like it's easier to do things there there's like more legal sanctions as these like small caribbean nations you can kind of operate close to the u.s but outside the border so you can kind of operate your own business however you want this seems to be like a similar play in the stands that he's going to a small caribbean country and going to be working with them on crypto adoption and i think that is going to be like a continued storyline we see with a few other players going forward did i see it with justin soon no i didn't so that's why his headline was fantastic uh naomi i'll throw it up to you yeah i um i have a lot of takes on this i'm going to take a step back from the justin hatings i actually like justin i think he's a very interesting entrepreneur um contentious obviously but very interesting and i just want to point out i mean that we could we could dig into that but i'm i'm so sick of that smear ",
        "3": "just being put like i mean it's it's ridiculous everything in crypto is literally open source code like you can copy and paste whatever you want but let's actually look at what he said because he's 100 correct here and i think that like he's on the money right now he says we cannot fully rely on the us market there are nearly 8 billion people in the world and the us only has 300 million people the us market should not decide on crypto with more with more than 7 billion people left in the rest of the world he's absolutely right we've just gotten through all these congressional hearings where u.s politicians are acting like they completely control crypto all over the world and let's face it they do because they have controlling interest in all of these you know multinational organizations you know that actually get to decide things decide things like the travel rule and you know these are just guidelines but you the u.s has the ability to sanction any country that doesn't approve of whatever their policies are you have you know the whole bit next scenario where they were literally blocking the ip address of us customers you had the people who controlled bit ",
        "4": "makes not even living in the us the company wasn't registered in the u.s and yet they were able to arrest people involved with this because it didn't apply with u.s law i am so sick of the us controlling crypto around the world and i think that it's a smart play to start working on these smaller countries get some like rallying support from places that maybe have interests outside of the the us like i think that it's very interesting what el salvador is doing right now they're in a very unique position because they are dollarized since 2001 they have used the us dollar in their economy rather than the colon and uh because of that they haven't had a central bank controlling their money supply they haven't uh you know had to give up any power by embracing bitcoin it's a lot more difficult for a government to embrace bitcoin if it means that there might be a chance this thing could undermine the purchasing power of their sovereign currency so i think that looking at other countries that are also dollarized that don't have their own central bank is a very interesting play i hope that's the direction he's going in not just saying oh let's uh latin america in general let's focus on the places that are ",
        "5": "dollarized uh but i absolutely think that if we can get a bunch of countries on board and just get this you know support brewing that's a very interesting play to me because the us right now is just dictating terms for the whole world and it's absolutely ridiculous and needs to stop but i'll throw to you jen justin sun becoming a diplomat wasn't on my 2021 bingo card but it also put us to smile my face this morning to the copy and paste comment though will i think if you if you look at most successful businesses i don't think you can find one that hasn't copied something from another one okay so that's because there's a lot of parenting in the crypto space a lot of people who like to think that they've looked into details or something and all they've done is read a headline and then they go and perpetuate some narrative about ",
        "6": "someone and smear that character i i'm not here to demonize successful absolutely there's a little truth but i just wish people understood the nuance of that truth and weren't just like parroting headlines which they always do and it's just you know endemic in the crypto twitter population it's uh this crazy population sorry yeah yeah jen go ahead we'll just talk no i actually i i was gonna i was gonna take a long-winded path to get to this question but i'm gonna get straight to it will maybe just talk us through like a quick notes on the controversy surrounding justin's son because we haven't talked about that and maybe everyone's in context where should we begin i think zach can can provide some insights as well since his time as editor here at coindesk i think that the thing that comes to mind is yes a lot of the tron software has been pulled from different projects and that's fine to a degree but the thing that pisses people off in the crypto ",
        "7": "ecosystem is when that software which was intended for like a decentralized purpose where anyone can use it anyone can look at the code anyone can run it and there's no figurehead it was changed so that he would be the only one who could control it and he was the one who is a beneficiary from all of it so again looking back at that hive story from 2020 2019 there was a project built on the tron blockchain and they wanted they didn't want to be involved with tron ecosystem or they didn't want to be involved with justin stone and he came in and basically rolled everything back and changed the protocol and there was a huge like pretty interesting blockchain war going back and forth just just because he was trying to control it and continue to have that project on his chain when entirely this is his parody i gotta jump in well i gotta jump in because we can't spread fud on this show it's about getting to the fact on this show and giving people information so they can pass through all the weeds that's not entirely true how it happened that's definitely a narrative that people push but if you actually talk to like the founder of hype for example a great interview where we dive into the details ",
        "8": "it wasn't initiated by justin sun what happened was when the handover from ned scott went over to justin everyone got concerned the ecosystem freaked out and they made a preemptive move to block justin's son from using any of his state's portion so the idea was that when steemit was around there was a big portion of steemit tokens and it was just kind of this like unwritten rule that you know ned scott was never going to use them for staking never going to use this controlling share to actually make decisions on the network now anyway there was this handover to justin and everyone freaked out and said is he or isn't he he actually never made any move to control the network right off the bat but i also understand the hive community's concerned right so they preemptively blocked him this led to a backlash where he went behind closed doors we don't know what was said behind the closed doors but he talked to you know leaders of the exchanges said like we've just pushed this new code can you please make these changes he basically like unlocked his stake um and uh and made these changes and then the community freaked out again so it was ",
        "9": "like this back and forth but i have to reiterate that it wasn't justin's son who who initiated this it was the hive community and again i understand where they're coming from because they're worried about centralization but he didn't actually make any play off the bat to control anything and i think he gets smeared a lot in that whole uh debacle there so just wanted to make that that clear but i think we're changing topics now and uh going to a break no oh zach reaction sorry zach you react look at this script exact reaction wow that's a new one um that's some spicy stuff guys wow i i get uncomfortable when mommy and daddy are fighting and it makes me nervous but um it was good to watch and um there's a lot of fact there so hey i hope someone got us a screen grab of naomi waiting to to jump in on will's point because that was the purpose like it's just teeming with like please i gotta i gotta talk let me say something ",
        "10": "i'm gonna sing don't make me sing it's going to be it's going to be interesting to see if you know if justin's on in the in the in the diplomatic arena like jen said if he remains contentious and uh potentially controversial within the diplomatic arena or if he is indeed a uh a force for good in spreading some of these technologies to some of these countries in latin america that's what i'm going to be watching "
