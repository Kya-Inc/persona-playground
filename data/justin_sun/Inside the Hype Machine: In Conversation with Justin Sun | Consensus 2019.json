        "1": "developer in the space uh mr peter todd uh he's summing up you know that to what he thought about sentiment about tron yeah uh he said uh some of us take tron so unseriously that we don't even know why we take tron unseriously so i guess it's a first question why do you think tron has struggled to get acceptance within the mainstream cryptocurrency community um so basically i think uh have several reasons uh first of all um we started from like asian markets so basically um from china so i mean it's uh quite like unlucky at that time like china like we finished all our fundraising in september 3rd and then right like after that it's like september 4th the chinese government issued a crypto ban so we have to uh shift our um community and all the uh and all the operation ",
        "2": "uh back to singapore and the united states do you think it's a geographic it's a geographic difference um yeah i think at the first um is that the second thing is i think is the development period is too short for us so basically what does that mean um tron is born in 2017 so most of the competitors we have compete with has been this industry since like 2013 2015 so so basically uh we have achieved like so much like in such a short of the time so you think they're jealous of you no no no i think it's just they need time to understand it's more like a a project i mean even serum just started in 2015 there's uh lots of the people don't understand the the community don't understand so one of the criticisms that kind of kept coming up for me was about your go to market strategy of course you know you released a white ",
        "3": "paper was about 14 pages you raised money on ethereum uh to launch an ethereum competitor and there were some criticisms of that white paper particularly from uh file coins creator juan binet who accused you guys of plagiarism not attributing using other people's code was that a mistake and would you change anything about that launch um so so basically i want to go back to the whitepaper first so i think at that time first of all the white paper is have so many languages so basically um so we can only you're saying it was a translation yeah yeah yeah definitely uh and also at that time um there is a very important um since at the time we don't even have lots of the english speakers at that time you know even as a founder myself i started to relearn english when i come to the u.s markets so but that has been i mean solved perfectly right now we have like ",
        "4": "350 employees and half of them and these are of the trump foundation yeah yeah so i want to ask a little bit about yourself and how you were involved in tron's creation so you're the founder did you code tron yourself i know you're not a computer scientist or a cryptographer did you how did you participate in the initial coding um so basically for tron i decided the most of the road map and the structure um but we have like uh would you say road map do you mean milestones or specific consensus protocols which what did you specifically contribute yeah sure uh first of all the road map is what i'm decided and the consensus mechanism is definitely what i uh decided uh based on the uh industry so i think also people um um don't know like tron is more like we are aggressive on the um on the strategy and on the business level but we are quite conservative on the ",
        "5": "technology level right so you're saying you're conservative on the technology level yeah so i know one of the criticisms of tron was that you guys didn't do anything new was was that part of the strategy to not to not innovate or to not do it technological it's not like not in a way but we want the technology to get mature enough before we move in uh it's like kind of like the like like the even like the apple moves in the in the mobile phone industry so they um wait until like other companies successful develop something before they adopt the technology uh because you know apple know their uh advantage is on their uh channels and also they got huge amount of users so um it's also uh i call it more like a lane mover advantage so um so basically our advantage is more like we built huge traffic and a huge user base and yeah so let's get to that point so you seem to believe that ",
        "6": "cryptocurrencies can massively scale now and it sounds like that's correct that would seem to go against a lot of the current wisdom which suggests that blockchains aren't ready to scale that maybe trade-offs need to be made to keep certain properties of those blockchains but you still believe that the tools in place right now to have a blockchain that actually provides value to users that right now with what we have yeah exactly um i think there's the two points the first point is uh that's also i think is some of our advantages why do you believe that because it does seem like you guys are the one of the only ones who believe that you talk to the bitcoin community the ethereum community they often talk about what they need to achieve on a technical level in order to scale but you think you can scale now yeah because uh uh we use like depots so um so our delegated proof of stake yeah exactly so our transaction right now is around like uh three meetings a day uh i think at the end of this year gonna ",
        "7": "to scale to um 10 million to 15 million but i guess the question here is at what cost right so you make trade-offs because you want some benefit right the bitcoin developers uh early on seemed to make a trade-off right they sacrificed scaling a lot in order to provide their definition of sovereignty to their users right they wanted people to be able to run nodes and audit the blockchain yeah is there something that you would do to tron some concession that you would make to not scale or are you just very intent on scaling um first of all for the first stage we are 100 on the scaling that's something we think is our advantage and also i think depots also have like a autonomous mechanism like how for example if some of the super representative uh which is the nodes producing the blocks in our network is not uh qualified for the job they will get reelected so the uh cycle for the re-election is like six ",
        "8": "hours so if they don't perform well they will get like re-elected for six hours um and at the same time we are also considering to bring the rewards to those people who do the validate who be the validator and who beats the footnotes in the network so which also um increase the decentralization so let's get to your uh the next part which is i want to talk about your elevator pitch which for those of you who are here it's actually directly printed on the elevators uh it says uh we are creating a boundary-free decentralized internet uh to return privacy and ownership to the people so let's let's dive into that um what specific parts of the internet do you think needs to be decentralized um first of all i think it's more like the infrastructure so that's why what specific parts of that infrastructure need to be decentralized yeah sure um basically it's also something what we do doing right now so i think first part is the the payment ",
        "9": "infrastructure and also the way how people store value so because the money is the the the first thing you want to decentralize and hold by the um money is not on the internet right now so what if you're creating a decentralized internet are you trying to decentralize the internet and if so which which parts um i think that's the first of all this is the problem of the internet it's also why the um bitcoins first invented in the first place right um but bitcoin wasn't created to create a decentralized internet bitcoin was created to create a well at that time peer-to-peer cash but now a store of value yeah i think it's more like uh we make the extension on top of that so basically uh you know the um 2009 bitcoin was invented and the 2015 ethereum introduced this programming money into the ",
        "10": "um into the industry and then we uh we right now we move to like a third stage um so it's more like um the next phase is uh also a net next infrastructure is like decentralized storage so it's also we're gonna introducing um in this q2 so maybe i can ask this question differently what is your definition of decentralized because it seems like uh you know obviously delegated proof of stake you have a concentration of people validating yeah so which part of the network is decentralized it sounds like when i read your advertisement that you want to launch a new internet with 21 people doing all the validating for that internet um first of all i think the way we define the decentralization um first is without like any permission to get into the validator in the first place so right now you don't need a permission to be validated no you can um as long as i'm one of the 20 yeah you can set up the notes and get people re-elected it's more like the democratic system right now we have right we only have ",
        "11": "like 100 centers but as long as they got the full representative we only got like one president and the 100 like centers as long as those people gets full votes i think it's fine i guess what do you think about the rights of users of the network so again when you're talking about decentralizing the internet uh it seems like you would want to have and i think there was a debate on the stage yesterday about what kind of rights people should have you think that the decentralized internet that tron would create would give people more rights yeah first of all they can hold all their value and when right now i think um right now we have like 400 the apps right now on the trunk blockchain at the end of year we would have like a 2000 i think most of the those the apps the the best part is users can always treat their data their values or their uh anything on their uh accounts with some others let's talk about that with the the ",
        "12": "apps so i'm curious about this is there an instance where you would stop an application from running on top of the tron blockchain say it was an app that did child trafficking or there was a social network that promoted hate speech would you censor those apps or remove those apps from the store no um i think for network perspective in terms of the network we can't do that so in tron there's no way to prohibit people from doing that kind of illicit activity um i think he's kind of like a bitcoin so um so on network perspective we can't do that but uh because we also collaborate with like a full exercise uh half easter scan we have like transcend so we have those uh browsers uh have those explorer have those wallets so they can like uh um they can delete those uh on those apps so you're saying that the ecosystem itself could uh prohibit people from accessing those apps at least i think we can um decrease the possibility or ",
        "13": "or fix that what happened ever whatever regulator came to you and said you need to shut these down obviously you're very visible what would your be your response to them i think i will try my best and collaborate with those people for building the ecosystem but also i will also let the regulator knows there is a certain part of the things we can do right it's a it's more like a decentralized blockchain technology so we can only do certain of things so you think the tron network is strong enough on a technology level to withstand that kind of attack in terms of safeguarding people's value yeah yeah definitely we have been on june 25th is our one year anniversary and i'm proud of in this year um the whole year we never happened like a single incident about network itself got hacked or something right so let's talk about use cases i visited the tron booth yesterday it seems like there's a ",
        "14": "big focus from your team on gaming and attracting gaming developers is this is this tron's target market yeah first of all like games is definitely what we do we launch a 100 million controller k fund just for accelerating all the game developers um migrate their games on top of the blockchain and it seems like most of the apps that you're attracting right now are gambling apps it seems like eight of the top ten as of yesterday were decentralized gambling apps um yeah i think right now at least a large part of the game is gambling apps well i guess i want to ask about that so you know there's this whole school of crypto economics right this idea that these data systems need to be able to maintain and secure and uh hold value over long periods of time so i was talking to one of your employees and i asked him uh he said he was talking about this game called a camera or some sort of casino game you hold the token called ante and you play the game with the token yeah and i asked him why you would hold that token he said well because there'll be ",
        "15": "future use cases for that yeah and so i asked him okay well you hold tron he said yes and i asked him well why do you do that he said i think there'll be future use cases for it so is that the is that really the thing that's propelling the future value here is just the expectation of future use cases so how does that become i think it's more like a mixture um so basically even like anti if you hold the token you can get a reward actually i think it's like every six hours or something that's what the tron token or the other the ante you are talking about it's one of the like the apps running on the phone i guess i'm just asking if i launch an adapt how do i know that it's going to be able to run on tron in the future so uh i guess what i would say is uh are you familiar with the phrase like circular economy um i think it's kind of a mixture of that so definitely like every everything you have like a future values right the network is development by the community every second but i think you have lots ",
        "16": "of the certain use cases right now for example you need to phrase the trx to vote so second you can freeze the trx for the energy for the bandwidth in the network and also for the game developers you also need a certain amount of the tr access reserved so you can run the apps stuff like that but that seems like it's all dependent on use cases like i guess when i look at bitcoin right i see that the miners burn electricity they need to sell bitcoin yeah in order to pay costs right and then other people need to spend bitcoin uh we're assuming because they want a money system that can't be censored right so this could create sort of a circle so how does the tron circle circular economy work who needs to hold tron and and who needs to sell tron how does that yeah sure definitely first of all um as an app developer um you need to hold a certain amount of tron or um you need some um certain of the people they need to vote for you or phrase the trunk for you ",
        "17": "because you need to get the bandwidth and energy in the network so tron is also more like a world computer so if you want to uh deploy the certain of the resources into your apps you need to freeze strong open burn trx to get um get those energies and also uh on the user's level so um sometimes you need to consume a certain of the it's just like the gas like the energy to play the apps uh and also uh on on the other hand um the community in the tron network they need to phrase krx to vote to complete the governance right so like right now like uh you need to use those votes to uh elect your super representatives okay actually i wanna switch gears a little bit uh to talk about bittorrent uh in my conversations with people universally it's pretty it's thought that this is a pretty good idea yeah most people it seems like have thought ",
        "18": "about it i talked to an early ethereum developer he said that he had thought about it but i guess i'm a bit confused about the strategy so it's a bit torrent you know we kind of think about it as one thing yeah but it's really the sort of peer-to-peer technology it's the company and it's the ecosystem of users so i guess how does uh you know how do you see that fitting together how does the company that you bought benefit from your acquisition of yeah sure that definitely um i understand your questions first of all i want to explain the difference between bittorrent protocol and bittorrent as a company right so um bitcoin protocol is basically just like bitcoin protocol ecm protocol trump protocol is more like a protocol level so even for the bitcoin inventory and protocol is not running on top of tron it's its own product yeah yeah definitely definitely uh i mean even for the bittorrent inc the company itself they can't control the bitcoin protocol right but i guess i'm saying you can't make the users use the token ",
        "19": "right um so basically i will expand the logic behind this but because the bittorrent inc is like very early developers in the bittorrent networks right so right now still like the 80 of the users uh their clients is developed by the bittorrent inc so we like you you may have know like um bittorrent and the utorrent so basically yeah um so um so first of the uh product we're gonna introduce into the industry it's like bittorrent b so so basically logic is very simple so in the future after q2 if you have bittorrent and utorrent clients you can just sitting the seeding the files for the cryptocurrency so that's the uh currency we introduced like i guess the bits i read the white paper it seems to assume that uh over time people will stop using ",
        "20": "bittorrent and money is the solution to that but i find that weird because people have been using bittorrent for years and they still do it but they do it voluntarily so how does the money help um first of all without the cryptocurrency i will say that um the network definitely worked very well i think the cryptocurrency will make the network better actually so um because before that bitcoin has bittorrent has been long suffering from like one problem it's a lot of the people stopped seeding the files after they downloaded it right so um so basically we're trying to increase like incentive for people uh continuously to uh sitting also to leave their computer open and the seeding files or um actively contribute to network but i guess people have stopped using bittorrent for other reasons too right there's netflix streaming is much easier so is the idea here to grow the pool of ",
        "21": "users using bittorrent or is the idea to get bittorrent's existing users using cryptocurrency i think it's like a both way okay first of all i think definitely we want to get more people especially like the people don't know the crypto exposure exposure to the cryptocurrency so i mean this will also bring like a huge volume for the whole industry right i think even like uh other communities can also get benefits from that because we are not just adding like trunk in the future bittorrent will support bitcoin ethereum like that will support bitcoin and ethereum another yeah definitely and how what do you mean by that that's also our roadmap so basically um first of all um even though btt was like a trc10 token is uh in the tron network but in the future we will create the the cryptocurrency wallet so it will support all kinds of the cryptocurrency in the in the bitcoin clients ",
        "22": "so let's talk about you uh maybe the kind of capital yeah sure you know as i said you're you're having a little bit of trouble kind of resonating with some of the cryptocurrency insiders is there any sort of anything that you think you need to prove does tron have something to prove over the next year or two years yeah sure definitely uh first of all we will launch our layer two solution uh called sound network um so it's also called the sun network yes on network after you uh so basically it's just like a community meme so so me my last name is not really like a song so it's more like in china it's pronounced like a sun it's like a sunji is a like a old uh asian like chinese chinese philosopher but uh because when i come to like a united states people always call like sun some sound testing sound um it seems like i'm like a clean energy ceo so so that's why i mean it's like more ",
        "23": "like a community meme so we decided to collect some network yeah interesting all right well i guess the final question so if if the haters end up being accurate and and tron fails will you continue to work in the cryptocurrency uh space i know that you you know you put a lot of uh of importance on success right you seem to be enamored with that is there a point where if you don't get success in the cryptocurrency industry you would go elsewhere yeah first of all i think we will succeed uh in the industry uh and also i think crypto is my like a lifetime career it's completely changed my life before that i want to be like a lawyer even prepare for the lsat um but after i get into bitcoin and the crypto industry eventually find my own uh cryptocurrency um i mean this is already become like like my lifetime career lawyer's not a fallback either justin uh not a thank you either yeah thank you for the questions and thank you ",
