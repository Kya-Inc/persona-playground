        "0": "joining us now is Justin's son Tron founder who will be Global advisor and ambassador of Grenada to the WTO Justin good to have you on the show so earlier you gave an interview just hours ago to Bloomberg And the reporter you spoke with Tom McKenzie tweeted Justin's son tells me he's prepared to provide FTX with billions in Aid need to do full diligence good moment to show unity in crypto industry is this true and can you clarify are you prepared to provide billions of dollars to FTX um so first of all I think we are having to prepare to provide billions of dollars to FTX uh I think um previously what I mean is uh more like uh basically I think the um right now FTX probably need uh billions of dollars to um to take it back to normal uh and ",
        "1": "right now obviously I think we are trying our best to evaluate the situation and also to conduct you food due diligence to making the next move if you were to help FTX what would you be able to do make customers whole or consider buying FTX um so first of all I think um right now this is not like our priority right so when we first get into the situation I think the first priority for us is product the interest of uh TRX and 12 ecosystem token holders interest so um so that's why we basically reach eventually reached agreement of FTX to offer a one-to-one ritual Redemption for all the TRX BDT GST song and HT holders on FTX so I think this is a small step ",
        "2": "but still we show some unity in the crypto industry and I think we will continue to discuss um to see what's the next step yeah we are seeing TRX the native token of the Tron Network surging uh as uh you know on crypto exchange FTX um it went from 12 cents to 29 cents yesterday after you agreed to move Tron based assets from FTX to external wallets so how are you doing this and is this essentially a deal alone to FTX um so um first of all I think we have done this before so I think uh two years ago uh ok X exchange also experience a sure period of time of like liquidity uh problem for a token holder to withdraw the money I think we are the first one uh offer help to them and to eventually resolve the situation so I ",
        "3": "think for this time for FTX is the same I think our on top of our mind is just to help uh trong and TRX token holders to make sure uh their assets will always guarantee uh one to one listen uh why would anybody want to buy FTX in your estimation uh this is a company that might be saddled with a lot of lawsuits a lot of legal liability a lot of potential criminal liability is there any reason whatsoever somebody would say yes I'll put in billions of dollars to take over and take on this problem would it would a Tron be able to handle all the legal hassles that are involved in what could be a very complicated messy and uh potentially disastrous case for for for whoever owns FTX yes uh I I I kind agree with you I think ",
        "4": "right now it's definitely I think very tricky uh situation so that's why uh when we uh first get um into um the partnership of like one-to-one re-show um plan uh we don't want to commit a lot right so that's why I think right now are we just gathering information evaluating it and also see we can do here so that's why uh we want we don't want to further commit to anything uh and and I understand the situation is very complicated uh I think we will stay like very cautious and and also see uh in this kind of the situation how we can Pro protect customer uh protect our users and also um to guarantee the brand uh for everybody in the crypto industry so Justin if you were to strip out the you know in any acquisition of course you you want to Value each individual ",
        "5": "part of the assets and some people that I've spoken to said you know what we really love the FTX platform as a trading platform even though maybe what the assets that were involved in the way they were handled were terrible if you were to strip out let's say the software part of it how much do you think that would be worth uh alone do you and maybe even some of the branding do you do you have an estimate on what that evaluation would be uh I think at least for right now if you want to develop like a full function crypto exchange you know uh with derivatives and sport trading uh I I think uh with a good brand name at least it's worth like 500 million dollars to one billion dollars I will say um uh not even mentioning a very big large like customer base um even of course right now uh the liquidity crisis is in the exchanges uh ",
        "6": "troubles up right but I think if we put along those scenes I think at least we are talking about like one billion dollar platform here foreign just to follow up on Lawrence's question so as we all know binance and CZ sort of indicated that they were willing to step in to kind of you know pour some money into this and then took a closer look at FDX and we're like no never mind we're out right um so I guess I'm just curious like why what first of all what do you think about binance's role in this whole thing because it's very controversial you know some people think that CZ did this purposely to kill his competitor um I'm just curious what what do you think about binance's role in this whole drama yes first a huge respect uh and uh admire for like CZ take courage um to try to rescue FTX uh I think in ",
        "7": "the first place uh and even it eventually it didn't work out but I still believe this uh proved like the leadership of CZ for the whole industry uh and I also I don't think CZ is like um purposely uh attacking like FTX uh I think for CZ what he's doing is just like remind like everybody about the risk of like uh uh um the certain situation uh but eventually of course is uh to eventually it turns out to be like a background for FTX but eventually I think the situation right now we are in the liquidity prices eventually uh is because of the means management of the customer fund and also the mismatch of the liquidity in FTX itself so I think they will they need to take the full ",
        "8": "responsibility for that um Justin also you very uh it's very well known that you have recently as you are wearing a t-shirt that says which is another exchange so is there you know if you you're getting involved with FTX and trying to revive it is there any conflict of interest here or how do you kind of do both of these things at the same time yes sure uh so first of all I'm the member of the hobby Advisory board so I advise on the development of hobby platform and help it on globalization for right now the collaboration between uh Truong and the FTX I'm just playing a role I'll try to help like TRX user and the trolling ecosystem token holders here so um right now at least for this moment we don't involve in like any situation to provide like any uh Financial or ",
        "9": "management like support for FTX foreign well yeah I I was going to ask uh you know there's been some talk of course of uh issues involving usdt and and uh and potentially some shorting involved in it uh what's the story with usdt and Tron I mean where do you see things going there yes so I I think yesterday uh we saw a lot of uh fud about like tether and also on binance platform um event right so we see uh tether uh the price went into like 1.03 uh USD against with uh busd uh and ",
        "10": "also for um for trondale Reserve uh we deploy I think around one billion um usdc uh to uh buying usdc or sorry to buy usdt so right now you can see um right now the price is back to one to one um so I think this is just like uh um a constant like every basically I think every season we saw like somebody tried to fast uh stable coin uh which I think we always try to safeguard the industry tree here and try to make sure the um the stable coin is packed and also um usdd on truang you know you probably see the news recently has become exchange of means and legal digital currency of Dominica and also the same time I think usdt on Tron today ",
        "11": "which I think is around 40 billion dollars is one of the most popular um payment system I think in in the world Justin just won't jump in there so uh the child network usdd's table coin you're talking about it was wobbling from its dollar Peg earlier this week you also speculated in a tweet that Alameda research which is the sister company of FTX might have started the deviation by selling its usdd Holdings do you think that is still true and I guess a follow-up to that is you've been talking to Sam Bateman freed I uh assume and if so how is he doing um I I think first of all I don't have like uh uh any evidence on on the particular transaction so I'm just like speculating because you know trying is a decentralized network I don't know like who hold any addresses but for um for ",
        "12": "the transaction I see um basically the owner of those usdt sell the usdd in a very cheap price is even without like even because we have different platforms so if you can Arbitrage on different platform actually you can get a better price but he just like dump it in the market uh costs I think short term like uh the price volatility to around like 1.02 dollars or something basically he lost like two percent by doing the transaction right now I think the uscd usdd pairs basically in ethereum and the trunk is back to normal just like usdt so that's for the USD questions uh and for svf I think I ",
        "13": "haven't talked him for a while the last time I talked with him is like three days ago so I offer um the TRX plan and he accepted uh and uh of course you see on the Twitter he retweets I think right now he's still like focused on to get FTX right back to normal and solve the liquidity prices a crisis which like as a CEO of ftix does his responsibility "
