        "0": "let's talk about Tron founder Justin Sun getting sued by the SEC this is some wild stuff this happened yesterday uh this was over TRX which is the native asset of the Tron black blockchain and BTT which is the token for the BitTorrent blockchain which he acquired some years ago uh there the LCC is out here saying that those are under unregistered Securities he's marketing them poorly and he had all these paid celebrity endorsers who were also not playing by the rules including Lindsay Lohan Soldier Boy Lil yachty and more six of the eight celebrities named here settled with the SEC for a total of was it four hundred thousand dollars correct me if I'm wrong but that is also in play so this is really this is really something the SEC is just going all out we got coinbase we got Justin sun in the same day who's next I don't know Adam oh he raised his hand ",
        "1": "yeah no uh not me but I I do want to kind of jump on this story right away because Justin sun has always been one of the strangest figures in the world of cryptocurrency to me he's one whose name typically pops up because we find out that he spent a ridiculous amount of money buying lunch with Warren Buffett or because he was the guy who came in second on the 69 million dollar you know Christie's Auction of um Christy's auction of the the beeple piece you know uh last year like every every time we hear about Justin's son it appears that it has to do with him essentially throwing around a bunch of money and another part about it that's been really strange is that this is not a chap who came into cryptocurrency super wealthy this is a guy who got wealthy around the time that Tron launched with again just like some suspicious stuff and Tron itself is a blockchain that is considered to be quite large but I've never met anybody that uses it and I've been in the space for more than 10 years ",
        "2": "so there are just all of these really weird red flags that make these allegations that the SEC has so far brought seem like they make actually a lot of sense effectively one of the one of the things that that jumped out of me is the allegation that there is an incredible amount of wash trading that happens in the tron token itself with watch trading effectively meaning that it's one party trading with itself in a way that makes it look like there's more activity that's happening than there actually is which can then attract people who are looking for highly liquid types of tokens so that allegation by itself I think is the one that like I don't care about anything else if that's true that explains so much that we've seen over the years so that's kind of my take on it uh will what do you think yeah she didn't give you some pushback because I think Tron does have an important place within crypto if you look at the numbers it definitely shows that over 50 of usdt is actually issued on top of Tron and if you look at its marketing or its fee structure as well it competes with Bitcoin and ethereum in terms of people using the chain yes there is a lot of watch trading certainly a lot of watch trading but ",
        "3": "there is a place for like these low security High throughput chains and a lot of people want to throw transactions around on and that's why Tron has actually been sticky as compared to a lot of these other blockchains that might say like we have high throughput we have this and that and they just kind of fall off the bandwagon right Tron for some reason just like Justin's son has been able to stick around and be relevant far past anyone's expectations now the question is will the SEC be able to put that to bed I'm thinking no because Justin sun is like the nuclear-proof Cockroach of the space who can somehow survive anything that happens though there is one curious thing that we have to bring up here and that he was give been diplomatic immunity recently by the country of Granada but it might have been revoked right before this occurred there's some good reporting for produce about this that definitely Bears some relevance in the conversation Zach Authority outside your hands yeah I'm I'm bullish on Justin's son withstanding this nuclear bomb as he has ",
        "4": "withstood so many before this is a man who has drawn to controversy and who thrives in it in fact we always see him sort of attaching himself to whatever the crisis of the day is we saw this during the FTX implosion we've seen this time and time again I would imagine that you know whatever ultimately comes to pass here Justin's son is going to go on continuing to be Justin's son so I think that is certainly worth mentioning will and I think your tether point is also very apt right tether is the largest Mark the largest stable coin by market cap and Tron is its leading blockchain most days relative to ethereum so the fact that these payments are occurring there with the stablecoin usdt suggests that it is finding use somewhere somehow I doubt that all of it is wash trading but Adam to your point that's a very uh fair thing to bring up I saw Jen's hand but I got to get Adam back on the record after that well I mean I would just say that is that again like those are the things that we think are true but again the allegations that have been made here do seem to throw that into question and ",
        "5": "I think again you know like have you ever used Tron to send usdt I mean like I again like I don't know anybody who has so it just seems to me you know like okay yeah so yeah that's that's what it is anyways Jen over to you please no I'm I'm completely with you Adam I think if these allegations are true and the market manipulation is happening to the extent that that the SEC is saying and it is hurting these everyday consumers that we talk about so much a regulator should be focusing on I think that there is some warrant here in what the SEC is saying and my last thought on this is how many times do these celebrities need to be charged by the SEC to learn something there are definitely more than two names on this list who have been under SEC under the sec's magnifying glass before and when when are they going to learn I don't know will what do you think Soulja Boy got got that's all I'm gonna say uh I think we should look at the jurisdiction ",
        "6": "here though as a last thought it's just kind of confusing how the SEC he has jurisdiction over something that's mostly not a U.S phenomenon right Tron is mostly used in East Asian communities and yet the SEC is you know slapping down in just the sun which means that they have information about where it's being used or they have an overly broad definition of what constitutes something being used in the U.S according to the documents that we saw with this says that at least one person was was using TRX within the U.S jurisdiction so that's that's a pretty confusing definition for you know being able to slap down on top of this blockchain but we'll leave the conversation there we'll go next to Adam and talk about block yeah so we are going to move on to block but just to say that is the standard if you have a single U.S user even if you try to kyc them out then the SEC decides that they have authority over the entire project so it's a fun thing "
