        "0": "Oh gentlemen I have here with me obviously don't need an introduction can we have a round of applause for them [Applause] so Justin son he has created multiple companies at a very young age he's going to be 28 years old this year and he's been nominated and has gotten the Forbes 30 under 30 prize four consecutive years in a row he's a protege of Jack mom and if we have Kobe Bryant who has obviously is a legend and he has enjoyed a very successful 20 year career with the NBA ",
        "1": "and five championships with the LA Lakers he's one of 2018 Oscars for best short film theory basketball very successful gentlemen here with me today so my first question for both of you is what drives your success what motivates you in the morning and just makes you want to get up and face the world every single day let's start with you for me it's always the love of what I do basketball for example if there's no place I'd rather be and if you watching the game playing the game and I'm training for the game there's nothing else I'd rather be doing and that's true down as well for what I'm doing in the studio that I'm building and you know the investment industry you wake up in the morning and you go and so for me it's always the ",
        "2": "love for what it is and I'm doing yeah I think I'm same mr. Kobe so when I first like to start my is also same city with Kobe come from I know that entrepreneurship we saw is my my life so I devoted myself like 14 cute business like 24 hours a day my son my nickname is what I can just they never sleep so into the business and here we are like after a year we have become one of the largest approachin platform so I think basically is my love my for my career and the business yes speaking of motivation and perseverance Kobe we all know that you have the nickname the Black Mamba right and you also come with that the Mamba mentality ",
        "3": "so Britta mama mentality I think like I'm a visual timeline it's like don't quit don't run and some people even say if Kobe Bryant gets into a fight with a bear you better pray for that there how has a Mamba mentality helped you through your transition reinventing yourselves reinventing yourself from being an NBA legend an NBA superstar into the investor and entrepreneur that you are today well it's just the same approach playing the game of basketball you're looking at all the little details you're studying everything you're constantly training and constantly learning and you're constantly solving puzzles some are big some small puzzles but you're constantly problem-solving and and I just took that and transitioned it to what I'm doing now same approach same attention to detail same kind of relentless pursuit for ",
        "4": "doing things to the best of your ability all the time no compromise like that and that's how I've been able to evolve even though I'm not playing a game of basketball anymore the game is still with me because I'm a caddy with me all the lessons that I've learned and you know 20 years of playing an MBA and you know 35 plus years of playing in total what do you think was the biggest challenge that you faced thirty year career at the NBA and transition your career to an investor in an operator well having a courage to go on and do something else this is very hard when you play a basketball you're really successful at it the hardest part is to say okay now I'm gonna show that and move on to something new and start from the beginning right you've been working so hard to get to the top of this mountain and now you're looking across at another moment you got to start at the bottom of it's very very difficult and you have to be ",
        "5": "brilliant I didn't know the whole work wrote dear basketball had the idea of producing it I didn't know there's one of those things where you know people may not like this thing at all but the end of the day does that matter what are you doing things for you got to do things to be true to yourself on things that you're truly love to do and then everything else before it so where do you find that bravery I know oftentimes the most difficult thing is to make that very first step so how did you find that favorite basketball was it was as simple as I had written it and announced my retirement and I was thinking about making it into a short animated film I wasn't sure and then in Gion I was one of my daughter ",
        "6": "she's the middle one you know they all go balls making in the film but she was sitting next to me while we were watching the hospitals the category for short animated film came up she owes a day we're gonna be up there next year I was like how long I thought I never said I was gonna write it she said well come on you always talk about mama taught me doing it do it I guess I'm doing it I guess I'm doing it you gotta lead by examples for me it came from you know leading by example with my children that gave me kind of a final push to do it absolutely I think that's very inspiring and I know that Justin do you have very similar values and we all know that you're such a hard worker that you never sleep and you're also backed by an amazing team who shares the same values as you do who's working so hard every single day and I know that you've started your company in ",
        "7": "a basement and that was one of the most difficult times of your life could you tell us more about your journey and how you may try and such a success yeah sure so basically when I first like start my business in 2012 so it's like in the Philadelphia at the time I was just like students so at that time I always want to run like a very successful company of one day my company will have like a positive impact on the society and also the social good I think it's just like when Chacma start his business in fact you like 1999 at that time they are also like in a very small room with like only making people there and jackpot for their objects is to become like a top than website in the world and that night is like impossible positive right but I think it's just like the mob mentality so even if the ",
        "8": "the idea what objects is sounds like crazy but you gotta figure out how to achieve that right it's just like when the trunk Ian first found it we we said we want you surpass this year to become one of the greatest blockchain platform is also a tremendous challenge for the whole team but we're gonna figure out how to be there step by step with like lots of the efforts right so that's why I think it's also enhance other people so we don't know actually will I set up of course I don't know who do you achieve those goals but will we be there we know in your journey in your journey Justin what was the biggest challenge ",
        "9": "that you faced and how did you overcome it yeah I think the one of the biggest challenges we face is in 2017 when his unit found aids we faced some bipartisan change in China so at that time we need you move to United States States you continue our business and at that time we don't even have like one parent in the United States we need to restart you to build up the team to get everybody positive because at that time it's like kind of like a bear market right now so everybody sound to boost the confidence they don't have the guts to take off so at the time we need you gather new team get everybody get on board and then moving forward I think that is like the topic time in trauma Street I am like you finally we made it and here ",
        "10": "we are absolutely so backstage I know that we're talking about how important a team is and team building so Kobe what do you think is the most important thing about building a team what kind of people do you think are crucial for success oh it's the hardest thing to do just what they're saying the hardest thing is a kid a collection of people to move in the same direction because everybody has different rules of responsibilities everybody has different personal all that you want to achieve and it's all been the best interests of further and accompany but along the lines of doing that can create personal dissension because your perspective of doing something and you believe this right from the company may indirectly offend somebody else right so I think the biggest thing with in a comfortable structure it is having respect for each other and understanding that things are not personal you're just trying to get ",
        "11": "the company to be successful in this direction but I think it's being mindful and having empathy and compassion for the people that you're working with more planes because that's the only way to truly want a championship or to build a successful company is to have a collection of people that that that find themselves and rhythm and in singing each other suggestin you and parked on your journey of being entrepreneur not long ago and is just a little over a year so I'm sure you learned so much from when you first began by yourself trying to build Twitter followers in the basement to now having a multi-billion company so what did you learn about the importance of teams yeah definitely I think the teamwork is heresy because like Hobie cats were like a kiwa or basketball match so basically hobbies are here I'm ",
        "12": "him a visa expired right I'm not Kobe so I only got like 24 hours a day so so basically for me I need to come out my team right so that's one of the lessons also I learned that's at the beginning of the entropy ownership at first I just wanted you everything on my own right and and then I'm not comfortable you give the the mission to others because I afraid them so that's I think you do this transition from like you give like everything to my team and trust them they're gonna do the best job in the industry and and then here we are we have like 200 people in China 150 people here and we can expand even more so basically also check model also told me the most difficult time for him is huge transition from only like 18 people ",
        "13": "there right now Alibaba is with like 30k people rights 30,000 people there so basically he's kind of the team how you feel that he emerged manager and get everybody on track it's the most challenging things but I think if you ever resolve this question if your company have been a fascinating industry that's a really good point because it is really hard to have that trust in others not certainly dealt with it in my career I'm saying okay well you know teammates here is he gonna make that shot to what the game was two minutes Levin or I can hit this shot here right a lot of times you boys so okay well the way you made teammates better it's just simply throwing them the ball given up opportunities that's only happened you have to figure out how to influence them in ways we'll we date on their own we'll ",
        "14": "get to practice an hour early on their own they will state an hour later it's our responsibility as leaders to pull that out of them where they want to be the best version of themselves because they want it not because we want them to have it and as leaders it's our responsibility to try to get our teammates in that place and then when they get in there because it's a lot easier for us to trust them okay no absolutely give that opportunity because you're working hard for it sometimes they'll make it sometimes they won't but you know that they have the determination and the desire to be the best version of themselves and that is the absolute key as you said it's all about investing in people absolutely so Justin right now we're really pushing the revolution from Internet zero to 4.0 and obviously everybody here is at boxing enthusiast or at least you want to learn more about blockchain so ",
        "15": "for those people but a lot of people still don't know what blockchain is how does it help why is it important you obviously have been in the industry for six plus years could you tell us in very layman terms what is blockchain why should help and how are you pushing the revolution from 3.0 to 4.0 so basically from my understanding I think the blockchain we are doing right now is more like a translator operating system so it's just simple as I was enjoy but with these trustees features so like you don't need to trust me you don't need to trust wrong you just trust a mess it's my contracts trust the technology it actually works in lots of the D apps so basically that's also one of our goal is make blockchain available for everybody so you don't need to know the technology ",
        "16": "you can directly get out and use it just like when I first introduced like iPhone for my grandma right so you can easy to get on the iPhone and then think the iPhone is benefit for her so that's why I would also want to block Chen the future can be a very easy about it technology that's also we launched the PT ki trying to air job the trip told you most of the common users we have like 100 many users around the world think an easier to get into the industry so that's also why seeing eyes I think the whole industry you solve this problem to make fortune crypto available for everybody in the world you have undergone a very big career shift you were an athlete legend ",
        "17": "and now you are a businessman and investor so what advice would you give to all of the entrepreneurs and people aspiring to be even more than they are now and what do you think is the most important thing for them to remember constantly motivate yourself to get up and do what you're doing you're building our own business do something you know I think that's the most important part you got to have a passion for this sort of what it is that you're doing you can't get up and say okay what's the biggest industry and what's the biggest opportunity available let me go do that that's not gonna work you got to be able to have the passion and the love for it because when you have that you'll problem-solve things you will be able to figure things out on the fly because this is just what you love to do that is that's the most important thing when you're building anything so if you don't have that I ",
        "18": "think you're going far and for me it was certainly true with a building studio being an ambassador how did you know that our first basketball was ready for you how did you know and that you want to get into investment and building businesses and supporting startups right it was twofold so one is about seeing people reach their full potential so as a basketball player I really hit my growth when the game became less about how am I going to carry this team to a victory it became more about how can I help Omar reach his full potential Derek Fisher Shanna Brown Josh Powell Pau Gasol and I got a lot of enjoyment out of seeing them get better and for investing that's where this how can you ",
        "19": "help entrepreneurs reach that goal respect dream how can you see the seller how can you see them serve the world the best way that they possibly can I enjoy that aspect of it and then from the business side of it I've seen too many athletes too many athletes made really bad financial decisions and it had this building horrible stories for post NBA career and so that was also a passion of mine of being able to show Kate listen we can't make smart decisions you can't figure out what your value is post MBA and that became another calling card for me and why I chose to get into investment and then just had the hope that my people meter was pretty good because that's what I look at when you're looking at investing you gotta invest in people first and foremost you ",
        "20": "have created a company that is has employees all over the world Beijing San Francisco Tokyo Seoul how are you able to bridge the cultural differences and what do you think was the biggest challenge in terms of integrating different cultures and I know they also acquire BitTorrent in July of last year how are you able to navigate also the cultures between different companies in the u.s. yeah so basically I think even like the employees come from like different comfort background even different languages and also different companies but we share like the same value so decentralized well so basically like we all have this believe in decentralization we hope all have this belief in the blockchain and cryptozoology I think that's the first thing we can have everybody on board ",
        "21": "it's the belief so so basically that's why I think Tron is not like other companies most of them is driven by the prophets driven by the business opportunities I think trying striven by by the idea trying by the belief and also we are doing these not only we can make money for these this is also very important but also because we think this is right we need a decentralized internet we need to give the privacy and rights back to the people back to the users so they can get benefits from the internet now the companies can get benefit from them so that's why I think that idea and the knowledge behind all these how our team to be together so I think this is also we share the same value with the BitTorrent as well so even before Toronto Port ",
        "22": "Authority in 2017 before has been a pioneer for decentralization for such a long time since 2003 and then they were promote this kind of idea to people around the world with almost 1 billion device the world so that's why I think it is electron Victorian is a marriage is perfect marriage it is evening so Kobe I know that you've also been investing in tech and what are your thoughts on wet dress and has said and why did you decide to get into this space well for me it's it's making smart investments I don't know if any company out there right now that's not a considered a technology company everybody seems to be intact in one way or another but like I said the first ",
        "23": "date you start with a tie start with his the people then secondly is this a business that you can get your head around there's a business that you understand the industry that you understand and this is something that we can potentially add value to in one way or the other whether it's device whether it's business counsel creative calss whatever it may be can you provide some type of services to further business along and help them grow be successful but ultimately you have to look at the people so whether it's a core consumer goods it doesn't matter it starts with the entrepreneur first do you believe the entrepreneur has the ability through tough times because you know that the best laid plans never really go out the way that they should that the way you plan them to do there's always articles as always changes and can the entrepreneur adjust to that and not only can keep himself or her something that well can they adjust a bit but in a rally a group of people to then move in that direction if the answer those questions are yes I ",
        "24": "know that you have spent some part of your childhood in Italy you've also lived in Philadelphia and what have you learned from going between different cultures like that and how has that informed you as a person and in your career great question I know the funny thing is like when I first moved to him obviously didn't speak one word of Italian and I go to the park because I want to shoot his kids out there just playing soccer on top of the basketball court like the world is completely upside-down severe a melanoma another beautiful full court basketball court they're playing soccer on top of it with two shirts as a goalpost like ",
        "25": "what what is happening right now but what also came to understand is that there are universal languages and for me in that case it was sport whether it be is soccer or basketball or whatever the case may be that's some language that's universal language and that tends to connect people and help you make friends and help me understand their culture better help them understand my culture better same as we just just said you have a commonality you tend to rally around that so even though I grew up in Italy in special town the Philadelphia have kind of bounced around I was able to find that one connection that was able to bridge the cultural gap and the differences between sports and progestin is a dream is the vision to decentralize the web with your blockchain technology so obviously blockchain is a huge friend in Silicon Valley what is the most the ",
        "26": "thing that you are most excited about in terms of technological trends in Silicon Valley or in the world well it's a big question well I think like Justin said it's having a mission that goes beyond the technology itself he has a firm belief and what he is doing is right future income and having that big mission to me it's extremely important it's not just about the bottom line although it's very important as an investor I'll be lying if I said that wasn't important but having a bigger goal in mind is the most important thing today we live in a society where you know all of our personal data our personal space seems to be monitored and it seems to be watched it seems to be the warm Laurie seemed to have control of all personal lives and one where we actually give it up and it for me it's going to be interested sit back and watch and see how technology navigates us through that ",
        "27": "for the next 40 50 60 years I think that's absolutely true that no matter what we're doing we need to think about the bigger picture and how this will benefit society or make somebody's life better on a smaller scale I think we'd have to maybe I think we all have a responsibility to serve one another I think that's where you know the the world becomes truly a better place I it was true for protest and when you started this company in and kind of given up the control and led the team trust the team in that process and the same for me given over the ball to my teammates and trusting with those shots it's like it's it's it's about serving others how can you help others be the best version of themselves and if we can find a way to do that it can all do that and it's they will be in a much better place yes can make the world a better place ",
        "28": "yeah definitely I think first of all can offer sounds like a u-haul choice compared to the traditional final financial system how do you control by the central control by the central agency pogchamp provide everybody like eco days you can play although you don't need to trust like the central government central agency anymore you can just trust our mass transit technology itself and also because it gives us secret key to everybody so you can control your own danger privacy like everything in control on your hands I think that's one of the biggest idea behind the blockchain so that's why I think not only the rock jam will benefit the society itself is also provide the society with that like a new order so everybody can follow this new order to become their own master so ",
        "29": "that's why I think blockchain is a revolution idea rather than attack knowledge sometimes people up here like AI and vlog channel and also with some other technology but as I can AR VR technology but I think that AI we are is one like technology progress but block channel I think is more like revolution revolution so that's why I always believe rock jam has lots of the potential once people except I hear once people get into the porch and they will think this is a brand new or not only just Oh time is almost up we have such a great crowd here so Kobe what do you have if you want people to ",
        "30": "walk away with one thing today what do you want them to walk away with every day that you get up are you doing what you truly you know yeah I asked my kids this I said listen if ya one thing that you do every single day for the next 20 years what would that one thing be what do you love right now that one you know a change because they're so young their main change but we wake up in the morning are we doing what we truly love to do we have one life life goes by ridiculously fast he's 28 I remember being 20 like I have videos that tell me yeah you were 28 once I don't remember that right so life goes by extremely extremely quickly it's important that every single day we're doing something that we truly love to do do not have time ",
        "31": "all right sometimes when we get into the thick of things we sometimes forget what we truly love and we always need to keep that in perspective so thank you everyone thank you Kobe Bryant and thank you Jeff in South Korea time [Applause] "
