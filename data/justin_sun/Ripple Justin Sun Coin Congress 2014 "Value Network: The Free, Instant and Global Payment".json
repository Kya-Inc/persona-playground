        "0": "I'm able actually introduced the well you network actually nowadays the the first value network I will introduce is the ripple protocol most of you may already get interesting it so I will give a brief introduction about the ripple and right now on the one application the ripple do is the payment system we do afraid instance and the global human system and just trying to make the payment more easier for the customer and merchants the payment before the Internet is is very frustrated we can see all these different channels to get payments is ",
        "1": "very difficult for people to finish all these payment and for example in in the u.s. we use the ACH to have this payment is the first one is the currency is just some currency and costs one to five days if you paid $25 you may can carry this in one day but if you just pay seven dollars it's maybe like five day or three days so it is close it's not open I will compared to the Bitcoin and the repo system and and they they have some fees are very expensive fees to to finish this payment as we know the Internet's are already Democrat is the news in the past we read ",
        "2": "the New York Times in us people daily in China and nowadays we didn't use all those newspaper anymore we use Twitter Facebook or two-way war in in China and which heading in China so we can see the faster free and open online publishers already take place of all these newspapers and we expect that it will happen also in the payment system right now the world needs the internet for value because right now when we think about Internet's we think it's a network of the information so on the information like email on can be sent sent free and the instance so why not the value can be ",
        "3": "sent sent out free and instance so the information exchange may may the world become a flat place but we can see expect adds to the value exchange right now the worries curved so we can also make it's become flat so the Bitcoin is the first step so the become has a very good breakthrough and so the time is become you get some minis to get one confirmation and get six confirmation you can confirm this transaction so is open-source and decentralized and and also a very lower fee but one on tier is like you problems for the Bitcoin the one problems is Bitcoin is more like a currency than protocol we know that's the Bitcoin also ",
        "4": "based on the blockchain you can take Bitcoin as a protocol but Bitcoin is also more than a currency also the Bitcoin the six transaction confirmation is also very good compared to the next protocol I will introduce the ripple the repo is designed for the for a payment protocol so we use the consensus mechanism so it will be three to five seconds no more than less than the six seconds to finish the transaction and we also allow all the currency any currency to flow in this network this is a difference we become the between the Bitcoin and the ripple most of the people one day and get nil about the ripple they buy XR piece we required ripples so some people may ",
        "5": "confuse the the XRP with the ripple protocol itself actually the XRP is just is secure in the repo protocol the xiv only have like you advantage for the network the first one is anti-spam so if the hackers want to attack this protocol we can use the XR p to protect this protocol and second is the bridging currencies so any currency can use the XRP to become a bridge currency if they want to do the conversion so so that's also the ripple R is not about xrp we we don't ask people to accept x RP to become repo user actually we are a to be companies so when the banks accepts the report to be infrastructure like swift do the ",
        "6": "customer even didn't need to know what repo is and how can I use repo and he can enjoy the convenience that convenience the ripple on brought to him so so the the value network is just like at the information network so is just move the value of free and the instant so so how this value were built and so I will give a brief introduction about the ripple apps the company I work for the ripple labs was funded by the Chris Larson and Jed in 2012 December so actually it's near 2013 so right now we've got like 60 employees we receive ",
        "7": "seed from total is six point five meaning and and we also call some very awesome funders so basic basically our object is to just to build a easy payment network for the banks for the financial institutions so I would like to introduce dears like to opportunities for difference peoples in this network because you know the repo protocol is more like a ecosystem is like Bitcoin so the difference persons can have like different opportunities in this network for the enterprise like banks merchants garments and nonprofits they can become gateway and market makers in this network and for the ",
        "8": "developers they can built up the FEV companies Ortega also provides the gateway integration work or they can build the Gateway themselves in the network so I will give a detail introduction about the enterprise opportunities right now we can see the mechanism of the ACH today so if you want to try and transfer some money us Q from the US bank to the euro bank it's very there is Q on difficulties the first is you can't just like transfer like small amount of money from the u.s. to the Europe cost the feast your high for the transaction and then is the is the time is very long ",
        "9": "so is well to five days and in this pivot here we give the process process that's the ACH first you may give the money to the central bank in the US gives you the correspondence bank in the US and then sent you the cross Bandhan Bank in the EU and then go to the central bank of the U and then coat you the EU Bank on so there is loss of the fee and you also must do the foreigner exchange job to make this happen so right now are you somebody can use Bitcoin q2 to finish this transaction but you still face a risk cost Chinese from the seven to forty five minutes is still a very long time for the foreign exchange market makers to finish this ",
        "10": "process so right now if you can use repos will be like no fees free and the instance six seconds transaction to finish all this process so so right now for example we want to cooperate with the financial institution like a banks to make them plug in to our network and then we can provide them a new and swifter system sometimes we call the repo system it's like a swift zero point on 2.0 so it's like a news with the system is faster and and lower costs compared to the swifter system so in this system the bank will get benefits cost we reduce your cost and reduce the time and the low the lower time and is ",
        "11": "equal to the mobile payment more payments and also the traders can have some arbitrage show up in this network so they can also get profits from the arbitrage and this is the opportunity of the enterprise and for the developer opportunities we already built a bond fund the name is called a cross coin fund - to help the developers to build up the applications and something in this ecosystem so for example the developer can build a PPS - through the API to different Bank and the financial institutions to help the customer and merchants to use this ripple Network ",
        "12": "and then if the developer they can build the a PP to directly connect to the bank the customer can deposit their money and we store their money from the bank also in the ripple Network the bank or another name is with sometimes called gateway so if in a region we don't have like the the banks to plug into our network we will try to have some hunters if they have done money surveys license to to become a gateway right now we we only have like one bank prop plug into the repo network is called video bank is in German and we trying to get more back into this network so in the in the in the China and Japan in this place we we used some third-party payment companies to become the Gateway and the in Japan ",
        "13": "um we just do the manually agent transactions so it will be more convenient once the banks or other financial institution plug into our network so so if the repo arm like to like the news demoralisation if the repo make the payment decentralized it will be in the future maybe the ACH and the Swift will replace by these new channels to make the payment easier yeah that will be all thank you and if you have any questions feel free to ask me you said you could use XRP to protect ",
        "14": "the network how oh yes right now if the because the transaction the ripple network is is free and the instance so if the hackers they have like meetings transaction per second it will creates the problem for the ripple Network so right now we destroy like a little bit XR piece for every transaction so if the hackers he have to loss amounts of the transaction per minutes it will consume a huge volume of the XR piece so it's prevents the hackers from attacking this protocol so one of the questions I wanted to ask is in we're doing a payment processing right now for Bitcoin how could we use ripple in in facilitating faster payments or maybe to facilitate payments in different places like for European ",
        "15": "Union merchants yes to the way if we want to use the repo protocol to facilitate this channel first we may have like license the gateway into in their region for example right now we already have our license day gateway the banks the Phaedo banks in the Europe once he plug into our network in this fourth quarter it will be convenience for the for the EU people to send money to the US or to China to the Japan so so so I may say the build up the Gateway is the first step and then if the merchants and other people wants to copy with us they can talk to the different regions Gateway for example in the EU you can talk with the phyto bank you are all you can show up for a second are you ",
        "16": "really connected with any Bitcoin exchanges so I mean can we get ya directly at a Bitcoin exchanges into the fidor bank right now we connect with the bitstamp right now so so lots of the people actually use the bitstamp you by the BTC in different region the the whole channel is like this if you are present in China you know right now China is banned Bitcoin exchange in China right now but if somebody want to buy the Bitcoin in China he can use the ripple Network convert his see my into the bitstamp USD and bite bite Bitcoin in the bid stamp so that's one modes we can cover with the Bitcoin exchange and transactions today where where are you seeing the most use of the the ripple Network today right now we have ",
        "17": "like you applications for first is the cross-border remittance so it will be very hot if you want to transfer the money from the China to the US it will be very high constants long time so if we have like different banks in different country both these countries can make their cost border remittance more easier and easier than in the past and then the second is we we right now we have a network trying to integrate all the boners all the points you get from the merchant to be flowing this network for example if you get the points all the bonus in the Starbuck right now but you can see all the Starbuck exponents on to another merchant so and also on you can use the the Starbucks points to get exchanged with the airline miles and you get this ",
        "18": "exchange we were just trying to facilitate like easier for people to see how their points are exchanged for another value access okay thank you yeah "
