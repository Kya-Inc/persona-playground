        "1": "uh we always love to be a part of it um so that's why we also sponsor consensus for many years I think four or five years already uh and we want to continue to contribute in the growth of crypto community what do you mean exactly when you say the regulatory environment here in the U.S is a little backwards can you expand on that sure definitely uh recently what I've seen uh SCC has sent the wild notice to uh coinbase and also they have um basically uh perform a legal action against uh Beatrix uh Kraken uh Gemini um uh basically I think most of the uh crypto Exchange in United States but eventually I think this will all be decided by judge and I definitely believe ",
        "2": "um the future is right uh we might have a little bit of up and downs in the process but eventually we will get there speaking of the SEC they actually came after you and your companies in an interview from February that I had watched you were flat out asked if there was wash trading of your tokens taking place and you said of course not and then a little less than two months later you were hit with charges from the SEC for just that among other things specifically the SEC charged you and your companies with fraudulently manipulating the secondary market for TRX trans native token through quote extensive wash trading what's your response to that um so first of all our legal team will handle on this procedure and I believe eventually uh um SCC is only the one who bring um the uh ",
        "3": "um complaints right eventually it will decide it by Court uh and uh um currently I think for our business itself it's not operate in United States in any way um so uh so that's why I won't worry too much about that so the agency agencies at least April 2018 through February 2019 you allegedly told your employees to engage in more than 600 000 wash trades of TRX between two crypto trading platform accounts you controlled with between four and a half and 7.4 million TRX wash traded daily the SEC said that the quote scheme required a significant supply of TRX which you allegedly provided and that you also allegedly sold TRX into the secondary Market generating proceeds of 31 million dollars from what the SEC said were illegal unregistered offers and sales of ",
        "4": "the token I know you said that you don't really operate in the US but the SEC the U.S agency is in fact charging you for these allegations so what is your response to all of that yes sure definitely uh I think first of all uh it's handling by our um uh legal team uh and also of course uh since we don't operate uh I mean in United States uh at all so um also basically the uh either like myself like Beethoven uh or Tron Foundation which we have dissolved like a long time ago um it's all based outside of United States so um eventually I think this is gonna decided by uh Court use it in fact issue a statement reacting to the charges on Twitter immediately after you were charged writing that the SEC civil complaint is just the latest example of actions the ",
        "5": "agency has taken against well-known players in the blockchain and crypto space and that you believe the complaint lacks Merit does that statement still hold true is there anything you would like to add to that uh yes uh I definitely I believe those complaints likes Mira and uh I I think we will let our legal team handle that and uh I I believe it and eventually we will sort it off I know you said you're gonna let your legal team handle this but what was your reaction when you and three of your companies were charged by the SEC with fraud and other Securities violations were you surprised or did you see this coming at all did they give you any notices any warnings uh we we didn't receive anything uh before uh this brings out so uh but I feel peace since uh we didn't do anything wrong right so uh and uh and also like I said with ",
        "6": "doesn't just operate in United States at all so so that's why I won't worry about it and also um I think the same time we believe you know crypto uh adoption uh um in this journey right so um always we we might have some backwards right goes ups and downs but eventually I think the future uh is right and we will eventually get there States Court it should be yours in connection to the SCC civil case in the filing from April 12th the U.S District Court for the southern district of New York ordered you to respond to the summons within 21 days did you respond to that summons uh I think this is uh uh very complicated law procedures uh which I think uh media misinterpreted it um but not I'm not like a legal expert ",
        "7": "um but my legal team explained to me so they will handle it and uh um and and I mean this is gonna be uh um um basically eventually handled by the legal department so I know you're saying that your legal department will handle this but according to the court judgment by default will be entered if you did not respond do you know if you're a legal team did in fact respond did they plan to respond to that summons or address the SEC charges at all um so uh I I don't have much information on this one particular what do you think about the continue here in the U.S U.S approach of Regulation by enforcement what do you think about that um so I believe uh SCC uh has lost lots ",
        "8": "of credibility um on those legal actions right uh when they first like take legal action against probably fuel exchange uh uh people will feel like like uh uh the complaints they bring uh probably uh has some Foundation but after they basically go after everyone um every players in the space uh I think eventually um SEC will face a pushback right event uh I think they already see um coinbase also file complaints against them uh I think they will eventually uh um have backlash on the action they they take now a few days after the SEC charged you and your companies it came out that you were no longer a diplomat for Grenada a role you held since December 2021 when you were appointed by the government there now the Grenada broadcasting ",
        "9": "network reported that you had been stripped of the status sometime after the elections back in June when the party which granted you the position was ousted by the national Democratic Congress when did you find out that you lost your diplomatic status exactly was it in March when you confirmed the news via Twitter or did you find out before um so I find out um um basically the uh um basically everything is already been said on Twitter so um I I think I know these uh uh basically the same day so um so I posted on Twitter so um and we have this uh a very smooth Handover so um all has been stated in my Twitter so you found out in March and then you tweeted that out in March correct exactly yes and also I want to say um it has nothing to do with the election right so ",
        "10": "um even some people may see like six months ago there is a leadership change uh in Grenada um but it has not nothing to do with that I believe overall our report is not accurate so what was your reaction when you were stripped I think it's not like strip of uh status so um it's just like change of position so um so after uh serving um the Grenada ambassador to WTO for um around 18 months so I I don't serve this partition anymore so when everything was unfolding with FTX you reportedly said that you were prepared to provide the crypto exchange with billions in Aid to show unity in the crypto industry that the funding was subject to due diligence in fact hours after binance pulled the plug on a potential deal to acquire FTX you ",
        "11": "tweeted that you were putting together a solution to initiate a pathway forward you ultimately did not help out the now bankrupt crypto exchange with billions of dollars why is that was it something you discovered during the due diligence process perhaps um so first of all I think we did uh have like a plan comes out with FTX at that time to offer a way to withdraw on TX vtt HT you know jst song like other uh tokens on FTX exchange um but the overall payout plan uh hasn't been uh conclude uh one of the reasons uh is because like hours after we released the plan uh actually you know uh the law firm like take control of FTX and decided to shut down FTX exchange completely um that's why I think our recipe rescue ",
        "12": "plan uh eventually didn't succeed did Sam benkmanfried ever come to you and straight up ask you for money as his crypto exchange was going under in November yes at that time we discussed with FTX team and uh Sam about like any plans at that time to to help the exchange user to get back their phones but I mean hours after we talked um he lose control of the exchange you know and everything went chaotic as we can see right yeah how much money did he ask you for uh at that time I think the initial um plan we are talking about is at least billions of dollars for a rescue plan was that your last correspondence with him this time you spoke with him when he ",
        "13": "asked you for that money uh yes after I think he lose the control of FTX platform we uh didn't talk anymore in January we've reported here on our show that you told Reuters you were ready to buy up digital currency groups assets and were willing to spend up to a billion dollars on those assets belonging to the company behind a bunch of crypto businesses like genesis a few days after you reportedly made those comments Genesis filed for bankruptcy now you didn't tell Reuters which assets you were interested in but in an interview from February I heard you say you were interested in potentially buying coindesk which is an independent operating subsidiary of dcg in that interview you said you had contacted their Investment Bank so where does that all stand now uh I think still in process I can't give ",
        "14": "much of the details but I I I think this is still in uh in process so are you still interested in buying coindesk yes I I can't comment um specific this one but I think still I mean dcg is still in the markets right so I think they are still talking with all their creditors about funding a financial solution eventually so I I will say this one is still in the process are you currently considering buying up the assets of any other distressed crypto company yes um definitely uh I think right now after three months um the overall environment has been way better than what we in three months uh ago but still I think we are waiting to help um so and and also uh once you continue to contribute on the crypto industry ",
        "15": "development I'm going to go back to bitcoin Miami because obviously it's happening this week what do you expect ing from Bitcoin Bitcoin especially amid the current downturn it's definitely going to be a different mood there this year after everything that has transpired in the crypto space since the last conference including all the scandals and bankruptcies yes um first of all I I have been in crypto industry for almost 10 years um since 2012 so um so actually you know even today right so if we see thousands of people come to you like Miami event is still better than like dozens of thousands of the people uh we first have in back to like 2012 right so I always see like after 10 years if you look back we have made like huge progress maybe like for each month right we see probably some um uh uh venues or fat spread in the ",
        "16": "crypto Community but overall if you take long term right like a year three years five years even 10 years progress um you you will be impressed by uh how fast uh crypto industry has the well since that so that's why I think Bitcoin Miami this year uh still gonna be a great event uh and I believe every participant will uh enjoy the events and uh uh next year will be even better so you have always been bullish on crypto I believe you first learned about Bitcoin in 2012 right yes and he started investing in it back then right exactly so at that time there's no even have exchange at all so at that time antique Ox is the first exchange right so you can trade the cryptocurrency and then later in China there is a few ",
        "17": "exchange been developed so um so after I mean after I look back these 10 years uh we have uh achieved so many things uh in uh less than 10 years so that's why I think the next um 10 20 years will be even more uh promising uh in the future since we all have because when we first start from scratch we don't have any resources right but today we have over 2 000 people working together to grow our business uh exponentially so that's why I believe for the next 10 years we will definitely achieve more what is your outlook for crypto are you expecting more layoffs and bankruptcies or do you think things will start to turn around soon yes sure uh I think six months ago right so basically uh October like November uh ",
        "18": "um is the burden of crypto so um so we have the experience uh so many uh bankruptcy and also fund at that time uh and I believe crypto has been gradually recovered from this button so that's why I recently uh you have seen uh Bitcoin ethereum Tron token has all brought like uh I think at least 50 to 100 percent compared to uh six months ago so that's why uh uh I I will conclude uh we already been um uh in the crypto uh in the process of crypto summer again so we we have been on through the winter and uh um so that's why I believe for the next one year and a half gonna be amazing so you think we now passed the crypto winter we're out of the crypto winter ",
        "19": "now is that what you're saying exactly well you're also an advisor to Jovi so I'm wondering what's in store for the future of that crypto Exchange and your smart contract platform to run of course what are you focusing on right now yes sure for a tron platform I think we are focusing on stablecoin development uh which uh which we have the best advantage in stablecoin uh we have usdt uh TUSD usdc usdj and usdd are all different choices of stablecoin we have grow our stable coin transaction to over 12 billion dollars per day now and the process over seven trillion dollars since we launched the platform uh and also for hobby exchange has gained a lot of attraction in Asia so we are targeting to be one of the biggest and popular most popular crypto trading ",
        "20": "platform in Asia so just a few days a few days trading me through your public address you wrote that you will personally Bear all potential losses from these trades and any profits made will be donated entirely to charity what made you want to start doing that yes because I believe trading meme quiet is fun right so it's not about uh making any money at all so I think the overall to understand the uh web culture and understand like how memes work in crypto and the general Community uh wise I think it's very interesting so I read lots of uh news about um pip and other um like a Shiba right doggy or meme coin trading I feel this is super interesting so that's why ",
        "21": "um I want you get into it and start to enjoy it world that you're currently currently in tro obviously you're a big name in the industry so wondering what you're focused on right now just in general in the crypto space yes uh I focus on like layer 2 solution uh SP torrent we have Steve wobbed a lot of like ZK snack technology and also I feel uh I focus on like defy development uh staking assets and nft on trong network as well uh and also of course uh who be exchange recently leads lots of meme coin and interesting assets in the crypto space um and we are growing to like one of the largest Exchange in Asia so that's like generally I focus my timer ",
        "22": "the CEO binance and recently the cftc here in the U.S sued finance and they are often making headlines these days what do you think is going to happen there and have you been in touch with CZ about all of this um so finance and CZ uh has been one of the most important company uh in our space uh I believe eventually they will uh find a way out with Regulators uh and I I believe without binance uh uh crypto industry can't grow much in the future so that's why uh I'm super supportive on finance coinbase like all the exchange and wants them to uh eventually to solve everything out with the regulator have you spoken with CZ recently um yes I think probably a week ago yeah ",
        "23": "it's here in the US when you need oh no uh so we basically talk about uh since in lives what are you hoping for in terms of Regulation here in the US I know you said you don't operate in the US at all still the SC is going after you they're charging you and your companies they're charging the celebrities that promoted your tokens so what would you say is the situation here in the U.S how are you going about it and what do you think about it just in the nutshell but yes sure definitely um first of all I think the six celebrities uh SEC file compliance has been settled with SEC uh um accounts there were eight celebrities charged and you were spot on six of them settled with the SEC in total paying four hundred thousand dollars yes uh ",
        "24": "um So eventually I can't speak for other people but eventually I think they will all uh uh settle uh eventually uh that's the first thing and then the second thing I believe definitely we want Regulators um to give more clear like guidelines and uh regulation uh um so it's easier for the people um practice their business um to complain that right so I think one of the Dilemma coinbase facing today is there is no rules at all for them to comply in the in the first place right so that's why they have urged like sec to provide a clear rules uh several times so that's why I think this basically um make it's very hard to operate crypto Exchange in United States because there is no clear rules for that and you don't know how to comply with that but you ",
        "25": "might bear the consequences to to operate like business right so which provide lots of uncertainty uh and the secure of those Investments so so so that's I think it's the number one priority in regulation uh in United States so where do you think is the operate a crypto exchange from a regulatory standpoint um right now I think probably Hong Kong so we spend lots of time with Hong Kong like Regulators uh Whoopi operates uh um crypto Exchange in Hong Kong and we are actively apply for Hong Kong lessons uh I think probably we will get in the next 18 months so uh I think definitely I think license The Exchange and the provide clear guidelines and the rules for the benefits like everyone in the ",
        "26": "industry using Hong Kong over Singapore yes yes what do you think is going to happen with coinbase how do you think that's gonna unfold right now coinbase actually sued the SEC after they got a Wells notice from the agency how do you think that's all going to pan out yes I believe coinbase will move more of their resources to Offshore um recently they are I saw like Brian Armstrong talked to you with uh UAE government in terms of collaboration and we definitely happy to collaborate with coinbase uh after they move offshore um since we have been like offshore operations for so many years but eventually I believe coinbase is a very important uh players in United States so that's why I I I hope they can continue to operate their U.S business and grow ",
        "27": "their business which I think is super important for the crypto community you have no plans to ever operate in the U.S no currently no and I'm sure part of the reason is the fact that you were charged by the SEC does that play no no I don't think so it's like overall regulatory consideration how do you think that holds it holds it against you will pay uh I think eventually we will find a way out "
