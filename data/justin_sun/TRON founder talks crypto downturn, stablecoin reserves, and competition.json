        "0": "well switching gears here and checking in on the world of crypto as more and more firms file for bankruptcy our next guest says he's ready to help those financially distressed crypto companies get back into the fray and joining us now we've got justin sun tron founder and ambassador of granada to the world trade organization as well as yahoo finances david hollerith joining in on the chat justin thanks so much for taking the time here with us today first and foremost when we think about helping out and what that looks like for some of the other distressed crypto platforms and operations what does that look like from your perspective first of all i think a recent crypto downturn uh really um destroyed lots of the balance sheet of crypto enterprise i think one of the biggest reason is because all the platform use a very big leverage in their daily ",
        "1": "operation so that's why when bitcoin ethereum goes down for example 20 like 30 for those companies has used a very large leverage it probably means even 50 even 70 percent down so lots of the assets got liquidated that's why we have seen um even like big companies with 10 billion dollars in their balance sheet even get liquidated in a very short period of time uh probably like around two to three weeks just like what happened in the financial crisis justin uh i had to i want to go back to may uh when tron issued its algorithmic stablecoin usdd now this is around the same time that uh tara's algorithmic stablecoin um famously collapsed and this is one of the major events that ",
        "2": "sort of sparked the downtrend and the deleveraging we've seen across the crypto market so i was curious could you sort of explain what's going on with usd it has about a a 700 million dollar market cap at this point and it looks like it had de-pegged and has got back to that crucial one dollar mark as of now but you know what what's sort of going to define whether this the value arc of this stable coin is going to be any different than tara yes sure uh usdd used uh different mode compared to usd and luna uh i will see usdd is a hybrid mode so first of all we have over-claddarized uh stable coil reserve so basically right now the reserve ratio is more than 300 percent uh i will say even more than a hundred and ten percent it will be qualsafe for uh usdb holders in the ",
        "3": "reserve uh currently we have trx btc usdt uh usdc so basically it's hybrid bitcoin uh other cryptocurrency like trx and also us dc and usdt as a stable point so trondol reserve will gradually change those clad ratio depend on the market situation of course i think back in may the marquee seems to be super panicked so that's why even for uscd we see it's over collateralized that's why we also have i think maximum has around five to seven percent deep uh in the market crisis but uh in a very short period of time uh the pack go back i think because of the marquee ",
        "4": "uh back to normal i think that's the first thing and the second thing um usdd has a very active uh custodian uh toronto reserve uh which we use different monetary policies on 2 man 10 the usd pack so basically when marquis is in the downturn we will buy usdd and buy crypto from the markets and when market back to normal we will issue more usdd and also sell some of the crypto reserve in our reserve to fiat to prepare for any market volatility and also i think the most important thing for toronto reserve is guaranteed the decentralization of usdd one of the most important difference between usdd to usdc usdt all the ",
        "5": "regulatory stablecoin is usdd don't rely on any banking rail so so basically we don't collect any users information so you get maximum user privacy at the same time you can enjoy a decentralized blockchain infrastructure that's why we have a completely uh decentralized but also uh safe mechanism to guarantee this um the stable of the stablecoin itself different from luna luna only have one mechanism to basically uh protect the stable of ust basically is luna as the token itself but it's very easy to fall into this death spiral if the market feel ",
        "6": "super panic in may of course i think the luna and the u.s price going down the same time so we will see ust will never go back to one dollar at the same time it's minting a limited amount of the luna token which crashed on luna to zero as we see what happened in the markets but usdd is very strong because we back by all the different collateral including all different kind of stable coin in the toronto reserve and that we grow in a very uh healthy and organic way i think which you can also see our balance sheet we have a very strong reserve and also the same time uh tron network has a very robust use case which we process uh over um 10 billion uh us dollar worth of stable coin every day uh and the ",
        "7": "usddo is only a very small percentage of that justin uh i'd love to get your take on this we had ftx founder sam bankman freed on on yesterday take a listen to what he told us about what he's been up to and love to get your reaction on the back side a lot of these deals a lot of these fails we reached out to everyone we put in the industry and said hey do you want to come in this with us do you want to do it yourself like we'd love someone else to take this on um and we don't want to be the only ones doing this you know we want this to be a broader you know industry effort um in the end you know the response we got from sort of other investors was basically wait a minute some of these companies look like they might have some financial troubles or so like yes that's correct that's why they need help right now like i don't know what you're expecting justin so how what do you feel you know what are your feelings or thoughts on you know one company starting to gain really a a massive stronghold in the crypto industry is that a good thing or bad thing um first of all um i fully respect ",
        "8": "uh and also uh fully respect the sam's uh offering help to uh all of our industry and uh entrepreneur uh to build a blockchain industry um but i also feel like we need healthy competition i think currently there's a lot of player in the crypto space um trying to become a very helpful helpful role for everybody in the space i think we should collaborate together to uh bring crypto back to uh normal in these uh difficult times tron founder and ambassador of granada to the wto justin sun good to see you and good to see you as well yahoo finances david hollarth "
