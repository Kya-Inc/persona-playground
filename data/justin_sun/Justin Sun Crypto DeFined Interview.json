        "0": "welcome everybody to a special edition of crypto defined for February 1st 2023 my name is Kathy Chu I'm your host for this interview Series where we look at the disrupt disruptors the innovators and the Skeptics of their one trillion dollar crypto industry crypto defined is produced by truth Dell a new non-partisan news organization within a Dell you can visit us at troopdel.xyz uh follow us on Twitter and join our Discord and telegram communities we're talking today to Justin's son a crypto Tycoon who is the founder of the Tron blockchain ecosystem and leader of the huabi cryptocurrency exchange Justin is also the permanent representative to the WTO for the island nation of Granada welcome back Justin it's been a few months since we've spoken thanks for being with us today yes thank you Casey you always have ",
        "1": "something going on yes Justin as we know China hasn't always been a friendly place for crypto companies um cryptocurrency uh trading and Mining has been illegal in China since 2021 but you said a few days ago on Twitter that you believe China will soon be loosening restrictions uh on the crypto industry what makes you think that yes I think we have uh several um signals right so we can tell the uh tell tell the difference I think first of all Hong Kong has been acquired conservative I think back to 2020 and 2021 and after uh post-pandemic period we have seen a dramatic regulation uh shift in Hong Kong um so basically I think Hong Kong right now positioned themselves as a hub for ",
        "2": "uh cryptocurrency right and also they uh they are trying to get every big crypto company to move their headquarter to Hong Kong and also recently we have seen um Hong Kong government has posted um regulation framework for stable coin and also of course uh hobby is also uh on the on name of the list of Hong Kong government consulted Us in terms of the stable coin regulation so which is uh all um I I think we receive lots of message from like Hong Kong government right they want to collaborate with um with the um basically the uh crypto company to increase um their um uh ",
        "3": "status uh when they compete to Singapore so today I think most of the crypto company today some of them is basically in Singapore right so we we have seen Hong Kong Singapore has been rival in terms of economic development for quite some time so so that's why uh that's the first thing I think uh um basically the policy change in Hong Kong because you know Hong Kong eventually is a part of China and all the policy change happening in Hong Kong they if you consult with central government first so I think that's the first thing uh I think which represents the major uh change of the policy happening in China that's the first thing second thing is about the uh I think I also wrote on Twitter it's about the taxation of cryptocurrency in China so um so I think back to to like 2020 right ",
        "4": "so people is debate about um like the legitimacy of cryptocurrency in China but right now I think recently uh Chinese government started to um to to develop like the tax standards for uh cryptocurrency trading um they want to get know about like how much you trade and how much tax you need to pay if you are in mainland China right so uh you if you are like a million China taxpayer so how much money you need to pay so I think that's also a very uh strong signal uh in terms of the uh uh legislation of cryptocurrency in China uh because you know for most of the country like I mean we can see the uh president uh presidents in UK you know in U.S you know India right so uh one government try to regulate the ",
        "5": "crypto and think the first scene they they will focus on of course is the tax taxation right so which I I think we we also see recently happening in China which I think is the second signal uh I think the third signal of course uh everyone's seen uh the dramatic change uh happened in the recent two months after a Chinese government lifted the Kobe restriction rules uh the whole country today I think is a big focus on uh get Economic Development back and the day before that I think the core priority for China is to contend uh Kobe pandemic but nowadays I think they have fully be back on the uh Economic Development mode I think yeah Justin has ",
        "6": "Tron or huabi confirmed that China is indeed taxing cryptocurrency transactions because I know analysts have said that on Twitter but does that actually confirmed that they're actually doing that do you know that firsthand or is that just yeah I I think I know this uh firsthand so uh I already know like some of the users has received you know uh uh the taxation this kind of notice from the Chinese government and uh yeah I see those documents so so I'm pretty sure uh that's uh something is going uh which I think is definitely a positive thing because you know after uh the government won't tax illegal transactions right so uh the tax itself I think in China uh is represent the uh the legislation and the legitimacy of crypto itself so which I think is definitely a very positive signal no you you've tweeted that you ",
        "7": "plan to move to Hong Kong which is a very big move for you Justin so what is your timeline for doing that if you are indeed serious about moving to Hong Kong and what does that mean for your position as the permanent representative to the WTO for Granada yes sure so as the permanent representative of Grenada I'm currently still based in Geneva right but I think for me um uh also uh of course I think since Hong Kong has been very friendly uh to cryptocurrency I won't I mean like permanently live there but I think we will definitely move our company uh and uh some of our function to Hong Kong and also personally speaking I haven't been back to Hong Kong since pandemic for almost two years now but I think I will definitely arrange my first trip I think uh to Hong Kong probably 3 q1 this year ",
        "8": "do you have a timeline for when you'd like to move there uh I I think hopefully Q2 Samsung Q2 yeah okay but you plan to still be the permanent representative to the WTO to for granette my base is still Geneva but uh I think I will uh visit Hong Kong uh more frequently definitely okay so talk to me about this it is I think this will be my base in Asia okay you're based in Asia okay great so talk to me about the significance of Saint Martin wanting to make TRX legal tender how did that come about Justin and how long did this process take and did it involve a lot of lobbying on tron's part I'm guessing it's not just a quick decision that the nation made so talk to me about how this came about and how long it took yes sure um definitely ",
        "9": "um so I think our collaboration with Dominica government uh in terms of making uh Truong crypto and the Tron infrastructure Trump blockchain as a nation infrastructure and a legal tender in the country uh really have good impact and the influence on all the Caribbean States so um so San Martin actually they know about Truong is because of Dominica so they learn about cryptocurrency and they see the changes happen in Dominica you know because in Caribbean all the states connect very closely you know all the states in those regions and I think one of the big is the advantage for San Martin I never been to San Martin but but since I basically be almost like 70 percent of all the islands in Caribbean so I know some marketing have several Advantage uh first of all ",
        "10": "um samaritin is one of the traffic Hub in uh in Caribbean actually so um so basically if you want to fly from any world any place in the world to Caribbean there's only two way so one way is go to European and then go to San Martin and then go to Reservoir Place uh and that's like a European round so for if you don't have like U.S visa you know that that's how you can get into Caribbean without touching the U.S oil and then of course um you can go to Miami or New York right to to there direct flight to to Caribbean so that's why I think that's like one of the biggest Advantage for summer things because something is the original hub for auto traffic basically I think that's the first Advantage second Advantage I think uh somebody have a very strong connection with ",
        "11": "um uh with you that's also very big because uh summer thing is divided in two parts um so one Parts belong to France uh uh EU and another part belongs to Netherlands um so so the this time the um the summer team uh make 20 go Tender Is the uh Netherlands so it's a Netherland Park so um so this is also a part of Netherlands I think this is also uh have a very special meaning so mean strong we are not only connect to Caribbean anymore right so we also have some footprint in European countries as well so so that's also I think that's the second uh meaning I think it's very important uh the third meaning of course I think uh Sam Martin is the second country right second region in the world to make chuang a legal tender so I think my I also created right so my kpi this year ",
        "12": "is uh total five countries right to make Trump legal tender so I think I I still have a street to go to to to meet my target but uh I I think this definitely also um represent a big milestone we uh we we have uh hit recently in a Caribbean region which other countries which three other countries do you expect um Tron to be legal tender in by the end of 2023 in 2023 because as a fact you have I mean this is in the works it's not like going to be a surprise all of a sudden to you yes uh so right now I think we've mainly focused on several regions um Latin America uh and the Caribbean uh region uh and also Africa so I think we right now we we targeted these three countries um uh three regions uh but of course some of them have strong relationship ",
        "13": "with European countries as well right just like summer team they probably be a part of the uh European countries as well so I think that's like our Target okay um let's talk about flabby for a second can you clarify Justin whether you're now leading Bobby I mean when Hawaii's blog post came out people were somewhat um I guess relieved or surprised that ah see Justin is leading Bobby and it seemed like it was shrouded in secrecy I'm not really sure why so could you clarify whether you are leading Bobby and what does that mean yes yes sure um so first of all uh Kobe didn't own by me so it's owned by uh about capital in Hong Kong so so basically they uh they are leading the acquisition from uh the previous owner rightly only to uh queue about Capital uh but uh definitely uh I'm right now the role of Advisory Board ",
        "14": "of advisory members in Hobby you know because in most of the board of advisor on the board is uh it's not very familiar with script tall so and also right I'm a very big name in on on crypto industry so so that's why you know recently I provide lots of like guidance and support for the current team to uh to explain to Caribbean because Kobe also adopt lots of the uh strategy uh expand on Caribbean and also of course I'm also very active in Asia crypto Community especially you know recently like Hong Kong departments so hobby is also a very big growing Asia so so I think we have lots of synergy there you know so I I think that's like uh pretty much like how we put it but you also own a lot of the quavi token right ",
        "15": "so but you are not yes I'm a token holder so so my uh I think if you uh talk about the this kind of the uh interest right or uh Stakes uh hobby I think is mainly focused on the platform token of hobby okay but it is fair to say because the huawei's post said you're leading them under Justin sense leadership so you are one of the main you're the main leader for Huawei that's fair to think of okay so can can you talk a little bit about how kwabi is doing quavi said he said it plans to lay off about 20 of its staff and maintain a very lean team going on um from one perspective you know there are layoffs going on the crypto industry all the time um other people have been concerned that this could speak to the help of wappy um as an exchange so how do you could you clarify what's going on at Hobby yes I think before that uh hobby focus ",
        "16": "on too much uh energy on global expansion right so hope you have a very big Global expansion team uh but I think after the crypto winter you know we've seen like coinbase closed their Japan office you know uh and also coinbase I mean close down lots of their efforts in Asia you know hobby so these days I think crypto exchange is very Regional right so uh so that's why I think hobby strategy actually is the opposite to coinbase right so hobby is very uh strong in Asia but uh has less I think reputation uh in uh America or in European right so so that's why I think uh after I get into the hobby uh Advisory Board I strongly advise them to focus on their Core Business which is definitely like Asia time zone ",
        "17": "instead of like uh continue to be uh doing everywhere right so we which I think is not a cost effective so I think uh I'm glad they follow my follow my advice to change their focus to Asia actually Hobby business in terms of business uh and the newly registered users uh it grow a lot in the past like uh uh three months even I mean during the crypto winter um and also I think uh are happy to see actually their uh laying of people and become more lean team which I think uh are financially you know I will be more healthy you know actually you know it's the opposite so uh as uh as a analyst right when they see the companies I think it's very important we see the sustainability right right so after we see the layoff you know cut off I think ",
        "18": "right now a company can be more healthy right be more responsible for their business as customer interest which I think in 2023 I I expect copy we're doing great this year since you know um we have seen the economic growth focused recently globally has been focused in Asia right so um China Hong Kong you know all opened up and has lots of business coming back so I think 2023 will be a good year for hobby the lobby will still be expanding into the Caribbean as you mentioned you've been helping them with that expansion okay it's definitely yeah still the key uh Caribbean Latin America is still something we want to do uh but we uh decrease our expansion in Europe you know uh and uh in the Middle East I will say so selective expansion selective and smart expansion okay ",
        "19": "um Justin there's been growing concern in the crypto industry with all these implosions of Celsius and FTX there's been growing concern that companies like FTS and Celsius have pumped up the price of their tokens use them as collateral to leverage up and effectively put investors at risk that they'd eventually be left with a worthless token are any of these concerns legitimate when it comes to Tron and hobby I mean sometimes you see Tron while being mentioned in the same um sentence as these companies that are doing this so how do you think of it are there any is Sean and Bobby doing any of this uh no we are not doing any of this at all so all of our customer assets is like one to one uh basically see it in the uh in the uh on the balance sheet right so so we didn't um doing any Landing boring with any ",
        "20": "kind of parties at all so so basically I think our business is only plain and simple right earn on transaction fee right so so that's like our business you know so so uh we didn't do anything I think actually you know um the book the scenes blockchain sorry Celsius and uh uh FTX is doing is very dangerous actually right so because you know the volatility of cryptocurrency is very high you know uh it's very hard for you to um to manage a huge amount of funds and then you know uh like FTX is uh running a big hedge fund you know to to to invest their customer money which is a as I see it's very dangerous and also uh um and eventually you know uh uh will turn ",
        "21": "into bad results right so so that's why I think I always advocate for us to do a healthy uh investment uh uh which is harmony right so we invest lots of company as well but we always deal with our Harmony uh and also uh for customer funds we we just put it out there you know uh um some of the people may say recently about uh hobby platform uh holding too much St token right but the real truth is we just call what what our customer holds right if our most of the uh hobby token holders put their funds in Hobby platform I mean that's like uh what we're gonna publish on our balance sheet right because we didn't hold any money with only whole customer money right that's our customer holds so and I believe this uh um is a very ",
        "22": "important foundation uh uh for uh for the whole industry right Kobe have been in the space for almost 10 years now so Kobe is born in um 2013 right so in this uh um in this uh past like 10 months you know uh on the highest right so range uh we'll be holding around 60 billion uh you you users assets I mean on the on the peak you know 60 billions uh US Dollars uh worth of assets but also of course because of the uh crypto uh uh winter right so uh these days most of the shared probably only have three four billion dollars left because of the price but I think uh it sudden affects our uh customer funds right no matter we ",
        "23": "hold 60 billion dollars or we hold like three four billion dollars it's just our customer money right so um yeah but but there's no watch trading of the tokens like FTX and Celsius have done right the concern about just basically pumping up the tokens so that it creates greater value um for the token for the exchanges there's none of that at Hobby or Tron correct no no of course okay well um one last question for you uh Justin last time we talked um uh we talked a little bit about we talked about the collapses of the crypto companies it it has so much has happened since then and I think with the dcfg situation in Genesis it falls for bankruptcy you've said before that you plan to spend up to 1 billion on dcg assets so I wanted to chat with you now that Genesis has filed for bankruptcy how do you look at this situation and ",
        "24": "what is your involvement in um looking at these distressed assets as well as others in the industry that may come in the next few months yes sure um I think you might I don't know if you're familiar with dcg's business so TCG is actually uh investment companies um so dcg itself I mean don't have any business right so they're basically holding uh the assets of different uh some companies for example like genesis you know uh and also great skill right coin desk you know luno right they are holding uh different parts of the crypto business I think right now um uh from what I've seen is like genesis go bankrupt and they might have uh debts and the financial ties with uh with with dcg right and and to solve ",
        "25": "those problems dcg might need to sell some of the assets uh as far as I know uh coin that's right now is on the table right but I will say are you planning to buy them Justin um I think I have plans but it depends on valuation and the situation right but I think right now dcg um they'll also be very careful and also uh uh uh in terms of like selecting buyers right which one they're gonna talk into uh we they have a Investment Bank represent them so in terms of all the assets but uh right now I will say everything is possible so uh probably I think all the scenes will we will see the results in the next uh probably uh 14-60 days okay but Justin did I hear you right that you're interested in buying coindesk uh yes that that's uh uh ",
        "26": "definitely yes why are you in talks right now uh right now we are we are we we contact their Investment Bank yes right now they use Buzzard as their their their their Investment Bank yeah okay well uh Justin Sun thank you so much for your time today that's it for this edition of crypto defined um we'll have a recap of our conversation with Justin's son on truth doubt.news in the next few days thank you Justin thank you yeah thank you "
