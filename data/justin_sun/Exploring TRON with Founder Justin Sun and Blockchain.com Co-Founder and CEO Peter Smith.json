        "0": "all right hey there welcome to the blockchain.com podcast my name is peter smith co-founder and ceo of blockchain.com at blockchain.com we take taking listings pretty seriously striving to provide access to assets that meet our rigorous listing process once we list an asset our goal is to help people better stand each token including interviews with the teams that built them today i'm excited to be joined by justin sun the founder of tron the open source blockchain platform that can run smart contracts and be used for building decentralized applications tron was founded in 2017 and since then tronix its native token which is often abbreviated to trx has appreciated over three thousand percent with a market capitalization of over 5 billion usd today trx sits within the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap and is widely used around the world um you know one of the questions that we love to ask people when they first start at blockchain it's how they made their first dollar or yen uh or pound um when ",
        "1": "they get started as an entrepreneur so you know when you got started how did you earn your first your first uh piece of cash yes sure um so i get into crypto industry around 2012 um so at that time when i read about bitcoin i think in 2012 uh then i doing a little bit research about bitcoin uh and then i find out uh actually uh there is a arbitrage opportunity uh local bitcoin you know um so bitcoin like otc website and and and taobao at that time so in china they haven't banned bitcoin you know so bitcoin is available on taobao because like some miners they sell um bitcoin to pay ",
        "2": "uh electricity bill um so they sell bitcoin actually in a very cheap price sometimes there are even like 30 40 price uh uh range you can arbi charge so basically i will buy bitcoin um taobao and then i sell on localbitcoin.com so uh so that's like uh i think the first box i earned and also um also the first time i mean i get into crypto i i remember like when i start to earn some like uh serious money right i think every time i trade i probably trade around um 10k uh us dollar uh so basically i bought in uh in taobao and then sell ",
        "3": "in local bitcoin.com and then i remember like when i meet with people like offline in united states you know try to sell bitcoin and then they give me like all the you know uh oh all the cash stack uh just like like 20 bucks you know make me feels like i'm doing like deals like breaking bad you know they also have this kind of the cash still so uh i think it's a very uh funny uh experience um to get into crypto by our recharge you know uh uh between like u.s and china at that time yeah um those are i remember those days when that some of the arbitrage opportunities are just massive like even between the exchanges yeah like between mount gox and between bitstamp and all that stuff is pretty ",
        "4": "pretty wild yeah so you know tell me a little bit about how you go from arbitrage trader to you know founding tron and what was the kind of original inspiration for tron yes sure um so i think in 2012 i get into crypto uh start to learn about crypto and in 2006 i joined a company called opencoin and then they later changed their name to uh ripple labs and then rebrand to repo so i i joined like ripple in uh very early days so that's how i start you like seriously get into crypto industry and start to uh trade crypto uh build crypto um i think in 2013 so in 2014 ",
        "5": "um so ripple started to develop internally about a project called oracle so um so at that time people started you discussing about uh about the smart contracts so so that's like how i learned uh smart contract concept in 2014 as we all know uh eastern italic also started to talk about a smart contract concept and then later of course i think in 2015 uh jd wow um basically ethereum in 2015 so and later um i'm even though i mean repo eventually didn't develop a smart contract platform at all so they uh pivot to um money uh uh transmission right so um but for me uh i started to think about like because at that time ethereum is ",
        "6": "based on um provable work so i'm thinking about uh to create a new smart contract platform which is based on proof of stake which is far more efficient than ethereum blockchain with a very low um very low uh uh exchange fee so so that's like how i come up with the uh tron idea uh because at that time you know 2017 uh there is just a few choices for the market for uh developing on the smart contract uh i think later in 2017 uh when we start to uh to build the platform we are kind like computer ceos at that time right so there's uh like two auto alternatives compared to ",
        "7": "with my contract platform is eos and tron you know so i think that's like how we start to attract our users and the dap developers you know building on the our blockchain you know uh and after that i think it has been five years wow time flies yeah and you know what's what's your role at tron like what is what is a day a normal day look like for for justin yes so i'm the founder of tron so when we first started the project i think i designed the idea uh designed the architect hire the team you know and also uh hire the community members start from scratch bootstrap the project so right now i think my normal days i think ",
        "8": "um first of all uh when i first get up i will um start you uh i think check emails you know uh messages and uh basically reply everything uh and then uh um uh after lunch you know i'm i i will start to do some research and to read uh some news and also uh to read about like team they share some message to see like anything i can help everyone um on the task they are doing and then at i i think i'm i i i read books and the uh news of the industry and also of course uh i i will do sometimes with you podcast uh and also uh doing interview uh and also of course uh i i will hang out with my friends nice ",
        "9": "yes um and you know like tell me a little bit about the early days of tron like how different is what you're doing now from the early days of tron yes you know now you guys have kind of achieved a lot of product market fit but i imagine in the beginning it was a little different yes so i think around 2017 when we first like launched tron basically the only usage for blockchain at that time is just for ico fundraising so uh ethereum there's a numerous amount of the project like long-term ethereum all use ico basically as a way to raising funds i think trunk is also one of the eos both eos and trunk actually raising funds on ethereum so i think tron and the eos probably is like one of the largest icos happened on ethereum even ",
        "10": "though we didn't build on ethereum at that time but i think for in terms of the amounts we're reaching yields and trial i think is one of the largest project at that time on ethereum but actually is i think it's very hard to find a product market fee at that time because the only thing uh is ico right so basically it's still um basically a project you can uh you can resume funds so so when we um launched the main in 2018 the whole market went to bear markets so um so it's very hard for a new projects to um to basically raising money you know and also for developers to build on the blockchain um so so that's at that time you know our team ",
        "11": "we started you thinking about like uh what kind of the project we need to support uh to survive in in the bear markets and really get usage uh in uh in the bull markets so at that time i think one of the things of course i think we are very good at today uh is about stable coin so at that time we are doing some research about uh stable coin markets because i believe in the long term um people will start to use a stable coin um rather than like bitcoin to trade crypto right so at that time i think the most um popular exchange is still on poloniex so but for poloniex i think most of the people is used to deposit bitcoin to the exchange and trade other crypto uh that's also like how like finance when the first bill is also using bitcoin ",
        "12": "as a main uh uh trading uh uh uh tours to trade crypto but i think in the future people probably gonna major um will still use stablecoin so um so that's why um i contact uh be phoenix of course at that time they are developing on usdt uh even usdt is very small at that time i think the total market cap around like 700 million dollars um something like that and and uh and also at that time uh tether is built our omni so you know omni share the same layer with bitcoin so which is uh slow and expensive and also it's um have lots of burden on bitcoin right so if everybody trans tran tra make transaction on usdt ",
        "13": "it will even slow the bitcoin transaction so so that's why we are starting to collaborate with tether on the wall uh usd on chuang um in uh 2019 so we've finally like finished the product and the release uh and start to integrate with uh different uh exchange who uh support omni and later of course ethereum and also trial network so um so at that time we started to build uh stable points so later we support usdt usdc on tosd um today we also developed like usdd usdj basically a lot of stable coins right today but i think we really started our work in 2019 uh of course i think today tron is one of the most like famous ",
        "14": "stable coin network in the world uh it's kind of like a funny is like when i first started in ripple to develop um basically at that time we want to do a stable coin transact network between banks right eventually i think troy is doing uh doing the same thing yeah um that's definitely when a lot of customers talk to us about wanting to use tron it's wanting to use stable coins on trunk yeah because you know tron is cheap and and fast um and so we see we see a lot of that demand from customers yeah today yes um and you know what do you think like at the end of the day what is what is tron you know like we've talked a lot about you know people using it for stable coin settlements when you think about like you know when you answer that question what is tron the project today what's the answer to that question for ",
        "15": "you yes uh if if um if for today i think truong i am willing to talk about trunks more like uh a stable coin settlement network um if we want to be more uh generic i think it's more like us basically a global settlement layer which is serum i think using in 2019 or something so basically we really want to become like a network uh which can settle like all the value right people will see us like a settlement network they will settle all their transaction on the network no matter it is stable coin or cryptocurrency or uh securities stock you know a bonds like everything they basically can settle on the network oh got it and you know ",
        "16": "like how many people work on the project today yes um so i think today if you include like all the projects uh and building on tron i think right now is around like one thousand and two hundred people um total i think work on all the product and right now tron also we have different uh uh branches so we have of course um protocol layer right so we have uh protocol maintenance and also we have um stable coin um so i maintain different stablecoin um stablecoin team and also we have defied him so building uh decentralized lending trading and also defy lack of different def defy lego on trump protocol ",
        "17": "and also we have nft uh division uh so building all different kind of the nft marketplace uh and also nft products uh and also of course we have game five division uh so building a games on top of toronto work so i think including uh everything together is like a 100 and 200 oh sorry 1200 people wow that's a huge team yes why do you think it's important to have that big of a team yes um so first of all um i think right now uh since we um i i think still on blockchain is in a very early stage so uh so kind of like we don't know like which gonna become the big scenes uh in the future right so um so that's why i think uh ",
        "18": "stable coin uh network itself uh d5 nft uh game fi all possibly can become a big thing for uh for uh um the blockchain industry uh so that's why uh we i think basically we bet our everything uh of course i think we we didn't expect it we we're gonna be in succeeding we do but i think we just try our best um to uh devour um the products right so which is uh very important uh for the customer i think right now uh for um the stable quiet and d5 uh we are doing the best uh in terms of stable coin and the d5 uh i i think we we are right now all of them is number two um for stable quiet i think we are kind like uh uh forty ",
        "19": "percent around our ethereum traffic but if you talk about like daily transaction volume uh we are even more uh the serial network and uh for d5 right now uh total tbr of tron is around uh six to seven billion dollars so we are also our number on the uh the number two largest the defined network in the world uh but for nft uh and uh uh and and the game fi i i think we still have long way to go since uh it's only come up uh i think last year yeah um you know sometimes tron is a controversial product you know and project within the crypto community you know what do you think what do you think is the reason for that controversy you know what drives that you know you've worked at a couple controversial projects now ripple ",
        "20": "you know used to have a lot of controversy i don't know if anyone cares anymore um but you know how did tron become controversial and why is it today uh i think for um for repo i think the controversy um i think all the controversies kind of come from timing so um i will if you uh i want to draw a conclusion so i think the ripple while the uh biggest reason for ripple be controversial at that time uh is because when ripple first developed in 2012 and 2013 prima is very controversial so at that time like all the crypto projects is all uh fair launch right like bitcoin like litecoin uh everybody is doing like fair launch uh but for uh ripple is the first project i think raising funds from vc ",
        "21": "uh and also um they have like a huge amount of the token is pretty much i think at that time is 60 um which i mean drive most of the i think uh uh cr critics and also controversy i think because of this um but i think today if you check like all the product like lunch the day right most of them like reserve funds for for the developer team so which is very common these days but i think in 2012 2013 it is very controversial i think for chuang is the same so i think we uh uh we have several scenes which i think is very controversial uh we are the first product at that time uh as a competitive public blockchain to become um come ",
        "22": "competitive to uh uh ethereum virtual machine so today i think it's become like a very common you know bsc you know avalanche you know polygon you know everybody uh compatible to ethereum virtual machine but at that time you know if you build a project compatible to ethereum virtual machine it's very controversial because people will say you just like copy crm code you know um to use on your own like software even i mean we can argue uh this is actually even better for ethereum because you know uh we build ethereum virtual machine standard to become like a market standards right but i think at at that time uh ethereum maximalists that they don't think this way right they they will attack our other um ",
        "23": "competitive projects you know um basically saying like they are copy serum technology but i think later in 2020 and 21 it's become very common right today you know bsc polygon avalanche you know all the blockchain i know right start you uh compatible with um with evm i i think that's why you know um i think the industry is always evolved you know it's kind of like the moral standards is also evolved as well so probably something you do at that time is super controversial but after i mean three five years is probably become like less relevant anymore yeah you know as the founder of tron when you're trying to track the progress what are the you know three or four core metrics that you're ",
        "24": "tracking closely to know if the project's successful or not yes uh i think of course i think i'm a data-driven person we always uh um tracking uh several data to to see how um how the protocol works i think first of all is the daily stable coin transaction number so for example right if you take like a one dollar transaction another people we will take like one dollar as a transaction volume today i think right now our general number is around 7 billion dollars to 15 billion dollars so uh depends on the market so it's changed like all the time um and i track this number every day you know to understand like how the market works and right now of course i think we ",
        "25": "are also trying to grow like other stable coin transactions other than tether so because you know right now tether occupies like 90 of the um of the uh volume uh but what we want to be diversify in the future uh to have more usdc usd uh usdj usdd stablecoin transaction volume as well and also we are attracts on daily uh uh create accounts so new data create accounts which is also very important right now i think our daily new create accounts is around um 100k to 150k uh so also this is a very healthy number so um so i think that's also uh a number uh i track every day ",
        "26": "in syria uh i think today is like the same uh level with us um with uh around like 100k uh growth of the new addresses and also um i uh attract the daily active addresses every day to see like how many people using tron and and what's the most like popular um contract on on tron as well uh not only trial network i also track on ethereum you know to understand like uh what's uh today's most popular apps on ethereum today you know so so we can know about um how the industry doing um so i think that's like pretty much the um like the data i track like every day so how many people are using tron every day uh i think right now yeah i think right now it's 1.5 to 2 million every day ",
        "27": "so um so basically the definition is basically if you make one transaction you know in the addresses we call you as a daily active user uh i think it's uh two million um people 1.5 to 2 million people every day and the total addresses we have today is around 110 million people um so uh ethereum i think is around 200 million so it's uh still um uh uh 50 more than what we have um so but i think we have confidence uh we will grow the project in the future and see if we can catch up the easier yeah that's awesome yeah um and where do you track these core metrics like if i want to track these metrics or somebody else listening to the podcast where should they go to ",
        "28": "look at these yes so i use uh trung scan the org on to to to track all the metrics we also sponsor tronscan.org on team to build uh on the browser and also i think today they already built a very robust and uh uh a good product so if you want to track all the data you can just um basically read the api from tron scan.org and that they are building the product basically as uh data services so everyone can feel free to track all the data and also do the analysis we recently also just integrate with channel analysis um so um so there's lots of the third party data analysis website uh right now it's also integrated into ",
        "29": "tronar work so um so you can feel free to uh check the network activity every day nice um you know what what else should we know about tron or what questions do you have for me yes um so um so i want to uh also talk a little bit about on the game so we are developed right now so uh recently we developed a horse racing game called the wing after horse on trung and also a pvp uh battle game uh wing ft hero on top of tron blockchain so uh this um we these two games we all collaborate with um finance nft um so if everybody interested in play games on the blockchain happy to try um finance website uh you can buy the nft and play the game um so um the cost is very cheap so ",
        "30": "every um basically uh characters if you buy only cost you around 50 to 100 so it's a very cheap but a very fun game that's cool and that's on the binance nft site yes yes yeah that's really cool um yeah any any questions for me or anything else we should know about the the tron network yes i i want you to ask a little bit about blockchain.com i know blockchain.com is like one of the uh earliest website in the industry cz is also work in blockchain.com before so i want to know about like blockchain.com right now the strategy and how to develop in the future yeah so uh we're ",
        "31": "still very focused on our original strategy which is providing access to crypto for people so you know we're very different mission than like tron which is building a network our mission is to provide access to all of the networks and so what that means is how do we make crypto easy for people to use uh and you know today we are about uh 30 of all the bitcoin transactions in the world and kind of similar numbers across other blockchains and that really has just come out of that simple idea of okay people want to use crypto but someone has to make it easy for them um and we do that for for retail and we do it for institutions now as well so we have about 1500 institutional clients all over the world as well and we really do just see ourselves as a market access company so we don't develop blockchains or tokens we provide access to them yes yes i remember when ",
        "32": "um when blockchain.com like first i developed like browser business uh that's like the first like go-to website for me for uh bitcoin uh transactions yeah very long time ago like nine years ago now yes exactly so that's like also like the first time i i get into crypto in the first place wow that's cool and also at that time i think most of the people don't even use the blockchain uh as a world to describe our industry i think at that time it's like only bitcoin you know blockchain become like very popular words i think in 2015 or 2016. before that i think people not even use blockchain to to describe uh crypto in the first place yeah yes yeah uh people just talked about bitcoin back then yeah yeah yes exactly ",
        "33": "yes there was just i mean back then there was just bitcoin in an open coin yes yes exactly um yeah that was uh that was a long time ago yes and the most of people still treating crypto on b stamp and uh uh i'm mt gox yeah and gigax yeah um what do you think is going to happen with the crypto industry over the next year like what's uh what's your outlook yes uh i think right now since you know our federal reserve uh still continue to hike so i think uh we're still in kind like a bear market i think right now um probably i think it will continue in the next year um so i think um probably we still need to um continue to build and also continue to build a good product for our customer uh before we can uh uh be before we can ",
        "34": "experience uh crypto rally again so um so but i think this is a good time if you want to hire good people um basically build a good team and build a good product i think this is still a very good time to do that since um most of the good product in d5 and nifty all been built in 2019 and 2020 so so that's why i think right now it's a good time for investment to build product yeah it's definitely a build season yes exactly um well justin i really appreciate your time today and i think our listeners are gonna really enjoy learning about tron um where can we follow you to learn more about tron uh yes and uh about what you're working on ",
        "35": "yes please uh follow me on twitter uh my twitter is justin truong and also um feel free to uh visit trump.network and trondow.org we have all the hacksaw activities on our website and my my twitter amazing well thank you so much for joining us really appreciate you making time to be on the podcast and hope you have a have a great evening okay thank you thank you "
