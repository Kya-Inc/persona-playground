Fred is an incredible builder, techno optimist, and friend. We're lucky to have him on team crypto and team human.  He went 2 for 2 on founding billion dollar companies (let that sink in). Still hungry and working hard every day.

X combatting misinformation in MSM
Attended our first  summit yesterday in Malibu, CA. Was great meeting so many awesome crypto builders in this down market. From flat coins, to p2p onramps, to onchain reputation - the future is bright.
Major milestone
Excited for our first  Summit this week. We received 600+ applications and selected ~25 for our first cohort based on the ideas in the video below.  Hopefully we can help them (in some small way) bring the next generation of crypto companies to life.
This is the path toward progress.  Decel narratives are all around us in popular culture and in meetings amongst elites. Thank you  for a breath of fresh air.
I never heard this explicitly mentioned at  but it was apparent, and I somehow internalized it and appreciated it, to the point where we actually made it one of our values at https://coinbase.com/blog/culture-at-coinbase-2021…
I used this to practice for my YC interview, which does a great job reinforcing the idea of concisenesshttps://jamescun.github.io/iPG/

I wonder if Google would ever make a high end Chromebook to challenge Apple  It would be nice to have a simpler desktop OS, but the hardware is all going after low end of market.

One point of clarification: you don’t have to be working on one of these 10 ideas to apply.   You can apply with any idea in crypto, or even if you don’t have a specific idea (but you have to have built something awesome in the past/have a demonstrated track record of shipping).

Big shout out to the team pushing this forward. Lots of work to do to get all our APIs showcased in one comprehensive product (Coinbase Cloud), with consistent authentication, logging, billing, SDKs, etc. We've built a lot of difficult stuff internally -  might as well make it…
Ok hosted one more crypto dinner from the west coast this time (this was back on Mar 8th). Lots of great builders & companies in this space who are undeterred, quietly working.
Like , I watched Free To Choose years ago and it had a major influence on me. The mission of Coinbase today is to increase economic freedom in the world, in part because of Free To Choose.
Worth rewatching in these crazy times.  10 part series, with a vignette and debate that follows in each episode. Incredible this was broadcast on PBS in the 80’s.
And Bitcoin + crypto is I believe the most powerful technology we’ve seen to increase economic freedom in the world. I wish Milton could have seen it.
Excited to keep updating the global financial system using crypto technology with our international expansion efforts - today with a big announcement in Singapore.  The U.S. regulatory environment has fallen behind other major financial hubs (UK, SG, HK, etc) in terms of creating…

1/ Today, Coinbase is launching Wallet as a Service, a scalable and secure set of wallet infrastructure APIs, enabling companies to easily create fully customizable onchain wallets for their users and apps.
2/ Wallet as a Service leverages advanced multi-party computation (MPC) cryptography for added security, helping keep user assets safe by securely dividing, encrypting and distributing keys to multiple locations.
3/ You can onboard to Coinbase Cloud today by visiting https://coinbase.com/cloud and clicking "Get Started"
Hosted a great "build back better" dinner in NY with some crypto company founders. This crypto industry has plenty of strong and compliant companies (even if the headlines would make one think otherwise).  Doing the work year after year isn't always sexy, but it's important.…
Hosting another one on the west coast tonight.
Excited for  launch tomorrow
As crypto holders, we need to elect representatives who will fight for our interests, and help ensure this technology can benefit humanity.  Crypto owners can be a powerful constituent, but only if we get organized. Sign up for #Crypto435

Rewatched The Martian last night - what a great film. It’s one of the only tech positive films out there. There is no villain in the story. It cares about scientific accuracy instead of making up random nonsense. Imagine a society that had more of this in the culture.
America risks losing it's status as a financial hub long term, with no clear regs on crypto, and a hostile environment from regulators.  Congress should act soon to pass clear legislation. Crypto is open to everyone in the world and others are leading. The EU, the UK, and now HK. https://twitter.com/IamRamenPanda/status/1625941125487017989…
I’m in Washington D.C. and had a meeting canceled. Will be at the Dirksen Senate Office building snack bar for the next hour or so, if anyone wants to come chat about crypto and how we get crypto legislation + regulatory clarity this year.
Woah soft serve ice cream. Tempting. Need more low sugar options though, this place is carb central.
Thanks everyone who came by to chat! Great to meet the folks working behind the scenes to draft crypto legislation. Hopefully we can get something done this year.  Much needed for consumer protection, and to see this industry built in the U.S.
Strong institutional interest in crypto despite the downturn
No Coinbase superbowl ad this year. But fun to see more QR codes making an appearance.  We'll probably use QR codes in many of our ads in creative ways. Aids the transition from offline to online. Makes ad ROI more measurable also.
Coinbase's staking services are not securities. We will happily defend this in court if needed.
Well said. "True on-chain staking services like ours are fundamentally different"
We will keep fighting for economic freedom (our mission at Coinbase). Some days being the most trusted brand in crypto means protecting our customers from government overreach.
Well said. There was no way to register (a disingenuous offer).  “Using enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating.”
1/ We're hearing rumors that the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers. I hope that's not the case as I believe it would be a terrible path for the U.S. if that was allowed to happen.
5/ Regulation by enforcement doesn’t work. It encourages companies to operate offshore, which is what happened with FTX.
6/ Hopefully we can work together to publish clear rules for the industry, and come up with sensible solutions that protect consumers while preserving innovation and national security interests in the U.S.
This isn't repositioning - this has been our brand long before FTX existed (starting 10+ years ago), and it will be our brand 10 years from now.
Cool to see real time collaboration happening more in science, with tools like ResearchHub  Science should happen more like open source software
"a moment of gratitude for companies that are willing to do (presumably) hard things in order to make crypto just a tiny little bit more lenient to users who want to learn."
True. LFG
1/ Every company should exist for a reason - our reason at  is creating more economic freedom. It helps us ride through all the ups and downs to have a bigger purpose.  Economic freedom has many downstream positive impacts in society...
3/ There will be many stepping stones along the way - even some more centralized components - that serve as a bridge to this more decentralized economy. Those are important, as we won't get there in one fell swoop.  But we shouldn't lose sight of the bigger picture.
4/ It will be a multi-decade journey.  It took e-commerce about 20 years (from ~2000 to 2020) to get to about 20% of global GDP.  Hopefully the cryptoeconomy can do it on that time frame or less. The pace of innovation keeps speeding up.
This is why we’re moving the world to more economic freedom with crypto
A classic
Great example of a potential crypto use case - NFTs are provably unique digital items (which sounds a lot like a ticket - concert/plane flight/etc)  Let's get the usability/scalability there. Keep grinding.
This is the bull case for Bitcoin
Wonder if they would consider moving to Bitcoin - that would probably be the right long term bet
Great progress on an ambitious mission
Developer activity in crypto grew year over year despite down market. Great to see builders building.  Great insights from
It's like our teenage AI is taking both the math and verbal sections of the SAT, probably soon to be fully integrated in one brain. So proud!

didn't say enough shibboleths!https://semafor.com/article/01/11/2023/the-media-loved-sam-bankman-fried-it-hated-brian-armstrong…I'm basically independent/apolitical, more focused on figuring out what is true and what creates the best outcome for the world vs what will sound good to either political party (and their associated media companies)...
...I guess that makes me bad at playing "the game", but I'd rather just be authentic and say what I actually think. In other words, I try to reject tribalism, and maintain a high degree of openness.
1/ Great leadership from UK City Minister  who yesterday told MPs that he still wants the UK to become a crypto hub despite FTX collapse.
2/ The UK is a well-regulated, technologically advanced financial hub and there remains a place for crypto assets within this. Impressive long-term thinking - I think we'll see every other major financial hub follow suit.
A big shout out and thank you to all the talented employees at  we unfortunately had to part ways with yesterday. I know you will go on to create great things, and I wish we could have kept working together.  For those hiring, please check out: https://coda.io/@coinbase-talent/coinbase-talent-hub…

9/ I'm optimistic that we can make significant progress on the above in 2023 and get crypto legislation passed. Coinbase will be working hard to help make this happen, please get in touch if you're a policy maker who would like to see more clarity of crypto regulation.
10/ You can fill out the form at the bottom of the post. Thank you!
8/ To get there we need to preserve the innovation potential of this technology. Regulation should focus on intermediaries (the centralized actors in cryptocurrency), where additional transparency and disclosure is needed.
Love this ad - Coinbase is all about celebrating builders.  With increased economic freedom, we can all use science and tech entrepreneurship as a lever to improve the world.
We let cameras inside Coinbase, to show the behind the scenes true story of how we grew it from prototype to public company.  I hope it inspires more people to build their own company and try to make a dent in the universe.
We released our tool to help customers recover unsupported ERC-20 tokens that were accidentally sent to Coinbase. I know this was a source of frustration - thank you for waiting
Self-custody is a very important part of the cryptoeconomy - decentralize
Lots of fear out there in the markets. It's important people remember how different Coinbase is in moments like this:
2/ Customer assets backed 1:1 (as shown in our public company financials)
3/ Well capitalized with $5B balance sheet (as shown in our last 10Q)
A lot of great points in this ACX piece that I hadn't seen elsewhere https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/why-im-less-than-infinitely-hostile…Crypto is widely misunderstood - but it will recover from every set back. I've been in this industry long enough to have seen it many times now (MtGox etc).

Lots of people are marveling at how human like AI chat bots seem in their answers. But it would probably be even more valuable if we can use AI to find insightful truths that most humans don't believe (or haven't thought of), as these represent opportunities to improve.
Things are moving quick!
We completely agree,  – comprehensive crypto legislation is needed to protect consumers, drive innovation, and preserve American technological leadership.
I don't care how messy your accounting is (or how rich you are) - you're definitely going to notice if you find an extra $8B to spend.  Even the most gullible person should not believe Sam's claim that this was an accounting error.
It's stolen customer money used in his hedge fund, plain and simple.
Agree, very important to have a safe mode you can turn off on these models.  We need insightful truths not kid gloves.
Wow - quite good

We all need to come together to build this industry in a responsible way going forward. Be wary of false information.
Thank you  for helping drive this research forward. On-chain accounting will be an important part of the cryptoeconomy.
Ad we ran in WSJ today - timely
Important to note
Twitter has broken just about every piece of this FTX story using blockchain analytics, while NYT is writing puff pieces on a criminal.  Feels like a turning point for citizen journalism and loss of trust in MSM.
Reminds me of a puppy - do want
Well said
http://FTX.com was an offshore exchange not regulated by the SEC.  The problem is that the SEC failed to create regulatory clarity here in the US, so many American investors (and 95% of trading activity) went offshore.  Punishing US companies for this makes no sense.
1/ First off, I have a lot of sympathy for everyone involved in the current situation with FTX - it's stressful any time there is potential for customer loss.
12/ We decided early on to be the most trusted crypto company out there, and the events of the last 24 hours underscore why this has been so important. We'll continue to work with regulators around the world and help build trusted and reliable products for the industry.
13/ Read more about our approach to transparency and risk management on our blog ->
11/ Long term, the crypto industry has an opportunity to build a better system with DeFi and self-custodial wallets that don't rely on trusting 3rd parties. Instead, you can trust in code/math and everything can be publicly auditable on-chain. This is a topic for another day…
Enjoyed chatting with  of  on the psychology of being a founder, our current crypto markets, and the pros/cons of being a public company. You can check it out here:
Thank you  and  for hosting me at #SFF2022 yesterday. We look forward to continuing working with you and your team on pragmatic regulation that protects retail users of crypto, while enabling Web3 innovation.
1/ I’m deeply grateful to Surojit for leading the product org for the past three years. He’s an exceptional leader and I’ve learned a lot from him.
2/ I’m also fired up to move to a more nimble product group structure serving our three major customer segments: consumers, institutions, and developers. And I’m personally excited to dig in a lot more and help drive the product vision for the company.
3/ I’ll continue to drive our mission to increase economic freedom in the world through the adoption of crypto. Let’s go!
Thank you Satoshi (whoever you are) and the entire #Bitcoin community for starting a revolution 14 years ago. We're just getting started. Bitcoin's impact will be felt for centuries to come.
Glad to see  encouraging better rule making for DAOs with the CFTC.
Apple has been blocking various features in crypto apps for some time as well.
1 in 7 US voters now hold crypto strongly bi-partisan as well
How does this serve America's interests?  Lack of regulatory clarity is harming American investors, and driving the industry offshore.
"Gary Gensler’s lone crusade against digital assets represents a bad policy choice that will translate into really bad politics for Democrats" https://thecommonssector.substack.com/p/a-case-study-of-the-electoral-power?sd=pf…
Great to see Coinbase Prime providing custody to DAOs like  and great way to keep supporting USDC as well.  We're excited to work with more DAOs over time.
Love it. Coinbase was born in chaos. Every down cycle we get stronger.
Avoid tribalism, think for yourself, appreciate nuance, and consume news responsibly (it’s addictive, and often incorrect).
Some startup ideas in here.
Worth noting: there is still quality news out there, and legitimate journalists/writers trying their best despite the sometimes bad incentives/race to bottom. Need to find and reward those people doing the difficult work.
Some excellent points here from  - beautifully written.
And FWIW my understanding is  is aligned with protecting DeFi as well, which is great.
Worth stating for the record, DeFi should be protected in any legislation that seeks to regulate centralized exchanges and custodians. Thanks to  and  for trying to get this right.
