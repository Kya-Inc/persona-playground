I enjoy seeing book lists from other people, so I thought I’d create one of my own.
These books changed the way I think by giving me a new mental model to understand the world.
I don’t agree (or disagree) with all the ideas in these books. But they did change the way I think.
Final note: If you struggle to read more, I’d suggest trying audiobooks. Something like 30% of the population are primarily auditory learners. By listening to books while driving or exercising, I can get through 25 books a year without trying very hard, whereas reading in print books feels like work. As one friend remarked, “this is the 21st century, books should read themselves to me!”
