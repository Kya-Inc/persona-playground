At the beginning of 2016 I set a goal to read at least one book a month. I was able to accomplish this (and more) largely by listening to audio books while exercising or driving.
Below I’ve listed the books I read, with those in bold being the ones I liked best.
I’m looking forward to reading more in 2017 (and continuing to learn in various ways).
What are your favorite ways to keep learning?
