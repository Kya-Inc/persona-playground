It was December of 2010 when I first read the Bitcoin whitepaper, while at home visiting my parents for the holidays.
As we wrap up the decade, here are my quick thoughts on how things have progressed.
Note: this post is inspired by Fred Wilson’s post for tech more broadly. Tomorrow I’ll post a follow up on what I see happening in crypto in the decade to come.
Overall, being in the crypto industry was a hell of a ride in the past decade. There were a number of ups and downs, and it was a very volatile industry to manage through. I’m really proud that Coinbase has stayed financially healthy during this period, growing to more than 800 employees, and has helped build the infrastructure to enable the industry to keep growing. We’ve continued to focus on trust and ease of use with all of our products, believing this will help bring in the next 100M and then 1B users to cryptocurrency. We could not have done it without the help of our incredible employees, board, and investors who poured their heart into making it happen.
Tomorrow, I’ll make a post looking ahead to what we can expect in crypto in the decade to come.
Edit: my post on what will happen to crypto in the 2020's is now live.
