Now that the initial fund is being raised, we’re starting a search for an Executive Director for GiveCrypto.org.
This is the person who would run the organization (similar to a CEO or GM in the for profit world). This role would report to and work directly with me, to help grow GiveCrypto.org. I will remain on the board of GiveCrypto.org.
The Executive Director will grow GiveCrypto.org from an early stage non-profit into the premier charity for the cryptocurrency community by raising money, building a team, and testing distribution methods to reach the first 10,000 individuals within 18 months.
If you know someone who should apply for this role, please share this post with them.
