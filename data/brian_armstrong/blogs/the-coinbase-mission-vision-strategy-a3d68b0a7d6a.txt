Three years ago, I published the Coinbase Secret Master Plan. Though much of it still holds true today, a lot has changed in the world of crypto and it’s time to share an update. This week, we hosted an open house where I shared an update on our mission, vision, and strategy at Coinbase. In the spirit of “default to open” I also wanted to share a video of that talk here.
At Coinbase, our mission is to build an open financial system. We’re doing this to increase the amount of economic freedom in the world, a measurable concept that can be greatly accelerated with the adoption of cryptocurrency.
In this video, I define economic freedom, talk about how cryptocurrency can increase it, and share how Coinbase can materially change this in the coming years.
I hope you’ll take a look and share feedback. If you’re interested in joining us, please check out our careers page for opportunities within Coinbase. We’d love for you to join us on this journey.
