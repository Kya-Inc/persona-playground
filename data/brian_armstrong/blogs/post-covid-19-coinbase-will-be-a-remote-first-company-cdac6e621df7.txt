I sent the note below to employees earlier today. I’m sharing it publicly here in case others find it helpful.
People are trading and using cryptocurrency more and more during this economic crisis we’re in, getting interested in sound money and what the cryptoeconomy can offer. Coinbase is continuing to hire and grow during this time period. If you’re interested in helping create this new culture with us, please check out our open roles (soon to be updated with more remote positions).
Hey all,
Tl;dr:
I believe that the future of work will look very different after the universal, forced work from home experiment of COVID-19. Over the last two months, I have come to believe that not only is remote work here to stay, but that it represents a huge opportunity and strategic advantage for us. Today, I’m excited to share that the future of Coinbase is remote-first.
This means that in the future, anyone who wants to, can continue to work from an office. That won’t change. What is changing is that (almost) any employee who prefers to work outside of an office, can. For many employees, it will probably be a mix of both. But for all of us, being remote-first requires a mindset and behavioral shift. It means that the employee experience should be the same, whether you’re in an office one day a week, five days a week, or never.
This change was initiated by social distancing requirements, but we’ve found silver linings: some employees are finding work from home to be a welcome change, and overall it’s been less complicated to transition than we would have expected.
I want to acknowledge that none of us signed up to work at a remote-first company. But whether this prospect is exciting or scary, please take your time in reading this note. I hope…
