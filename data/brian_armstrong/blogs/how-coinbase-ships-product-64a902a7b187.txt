Coinbase ships a lot of product for a small team. We have 24 engineers, 3 designers, and 3 product managers (in addition to a number of other very talented teams) who help build our buy/sell service (across web and mobile), exchange, developer platform, and merchant tools which serve 2.8M customers in 32 countries.
In this post I’d like to give a peek behind the curtain at how we ship product. We’ve evolved this process over the past 3 years, and I’m sure have a lot more room to improve it as we continue growing.
This is the process that our product managers (roughly) follow.
Hopefully this gives some insight into how we work. I’m sure we’ll continue to improve it as we go.

We’re working toward a future where the world has an open system for money and payments.
