        "0": "okay so ii go morning guys it's great to be here I was last year many years ago I actually worked on tuliver I worked here for 16 years at CSR which is probably the longest I've ever been anyway I feel like a bit like a preacher in a church today with an empty front row but but more importantly I think over the years speaking about digitalization is just like preaching in a church it's more about faith than fact and I think up until recently talking about digitalization has been pretty much more about faith the faith in fact but over the last years everybody I think sees it everybody says this is definitely you know this isn't this isn't sci-fi anymore drill so what I tried to do is I said it's not I'm not about predicting the future it's not to say yeah we know there'll be 50 billion connected devices in 2020 and 7 billion people connected to the internet etc etc we know that the question is what does it mean now ",
        "1": "normally I go around speaking to business people about it and that's about how did that make sense of digitalization and how should they craft a strategy about where to play and how to win tweaking that a little bit to have a slightly higher sort of more industry therefore focus so yeah go it's nit see how it goes I think the first thing that most people ask me is if is it gonna affect me yeah we all know that you know record companies have been disrupted and codecs been disrupted but is it going to affect me and the place to start is what I call economics 101 let's look at industry structure and it says yeah if you're in primary industry so agriculture mining oil gas the extractive industries here at a relatively lower level of threat of being disrupted if you're in the secondary industry is manufacturing processing beneficiation and so on you're at a higher level of being disrupted a higher risk of being disrupted once you start getting to the ",
        "2": "tertiary industries service industries like retail financial services then the risk of being significantly disrupted is getting high and of course when you get to what is now being pulled out of the tertiary sector and known as the core tannery sector the knowledge sector of the economy you're at an extreme level likelihood have been disrupted if you haven't been already so that's things like R&D legal services education health care the diagnostic side of healthcare and the thing is it's tempting with this and you think oh it's only those guys at the top of the pyramid there that are therefore at risk but the problem is the South African economy click looks like this let me go back one so it's actually overwhelmingly weighted towards the top of there that's the South African economy people might think oh that looks like the OECD countries no that's the South African economy and then if we overlay that risk profile on ",
        "3": "top of this the lower ones are lower risk but we see that two-thirds of the South African economy is that a very high risk of being disrupted and another quarter is that a significant risk of being disrupted so the short point about this is that the majority of the South African industry is facing significant disruption over the next five to ten years so there's no way to hide okay so then the question is what what he dimension to do so so they try and make some sense of what is this thing called digitalization why is it so disruptive is it just about the technology and my thesis is a bit different and this is quite intermittent so I don't know if it's a battery or maybe I'm just impatient but my belief is okay how much just be patient I've been told buddy my wife tells me the same thing by the way my view is that proper ",
        "4": "innovation and change happens when previously previously different things come together so the examples are uses when water and hydrogen come together you get water when fuel and heat and oxygen come together you get fire when man and woman come together you get love and when sperm and egg come together you get life when some of you might know my background when blues and gospel come together you get rock and roll so you get when different things come together you get really powerful change and I think it's the same with digitalization the tick is really important there's I mean with urine and blockchain mobility Internet of Things artificial intelligence machine learning virtual reality I could go on and on and on these are really important they're underpin this whole phenomenon that we see in but I would argue this phenomenon ",
        "5": "of digitalization is not only and perhaps not even primarily about the take it is equally about the way our society in our market is transforming there we all want instant on services we all want things personalized we all want service on demand we all want zero attached Millennials just wanted more than the rest of us but everybody's going social we're all getting active citizenships and act active customership so the way society is changing is as big and I would argue that Facebook and Twitter and Instagram are more about changing society than the tech the tech is good but it's actually more about the changing society and then there's the third critical ingredient and that's the way business is changing that we now have crowdsourcing and platform business models and virality and whole new ways of digital marketing and again let's take some of the classic examples air B&B is more about the business model as is uber and how we ",
        "6": "could carry on so this is this digital phenomenon I said intersections are so important the reason this digital transformation we're seeing is so powerful it's built on the tech but it's intersecting with society and it's intersecting with the way business is changing and that's why it's transforming the world now it's all good and well to say ok so that's what it is there these are some of the dimensions of what it is but what businesspeople then ask me so that's cool but that doesn't help me craft a strategy for to respond so I need to sort of South Africans we love sporting metaphors so I'm going to branch into a sporting metaphor which I must confess this actually I first saw this with McKinsey I didn't pay 1.6 billion ran for it but I think it's a good metaphor word in it at the bottom it says money why does Roger Federer make so much money and we'd all have our theories ",
        "7": "about why and makes so much money and the question I'd ask would it would it be the same if you played badminton and of course the answer's no so why does roger federer make so much money the answer is firstly it K it comes down to two factors firstly it's about the game you choose to play tennis is fourteen times that is more lucrative than the average of all record sports put together so badminton squash table tennis etcetera etcetera so picking the right game that you play is really important the second reason Roger Federer makes so much money is it competes much better that 14 is the average earning of the top 10 tennis players in 2015 the 57 million u.s. dollars was Roger Federer's earnings so there if you think from the business strategy it's the same business strategy is the same as this metaphor it's about picking the right game to play and in playing that game better than everybody else now let's focus a little bit on ",
        "8": "where to play and I'm going to go into four areas that I think are relevant at an individual business level as well as at a industry level the first thing is the game you play does matter so if you look at the average economic profit of a whole lot of different industries this was over 3,000 companies in about a hundred and 50 different industries you see that some companies are wireless telecoms and pharmaceuticals have a propensity to make good economic profits and others like airlines and electric utilities aka sa a and Eskom struggle to make good economic profits so the game you play really matters it doesn't mean you can't make a profit er it just means you've got to be that much better than the other guys to make a profit so the game had a broad industry sector does matter but what's actually where things get really interesting is when we look at individual company growth so that ",
        "9": "McKinsey that which is where first saw this they did the study at the top 200 European and US growth companies and on average these companies grew by 8.6 percent per year for sustained period of I think six years or something which is pretty good growth but what's interesting is where did that come from five point five percent two thirds of it almost came from the growth of the segments they were in it's just they were in wireless telecoms Wireless was growing survey group they were in pharmaceuticals pharmaceuticals were growing so that's why they grew then another third of the growth 3% to came from buying it mergers and acquisitions what's actually shocking particularly for people in sales is that only 0.1 percent came from increasing market share so it says guys pick the right portfolio of places ready to play as the primary thing about where to grow and I believe that applies as much at an economic level now I mean at an industry level as it does at a business level so ",
        "10": "South African industry collectively chooses the wrong portfolio of industries to be in the South African economy will not grow we need to pick the right portfolio what's actually important about this is we've got to do that the right level so the the industry is is divided into a the World Bank divides the global economy into 11 sectors 24 industry groups 68 industries 157 sub industries and thousands of segments and what's really interesting here is that when you look we looked at those 200 companies and their growth there was absolutely no correlation about to that all the growth came from making the right choices at the segment level so for example another thing that some of you might know about my background I quite like wine there's only two segments of the global wine ",
        "11": "industry that are growing one is sparkling wine they're just another use of this piece of takeaway information is roses interesting but it's that sort of level if you want to say I'm going to get growth out of the sector choose you've got to go down to that level of granularity so this and one in where to play find the right high-growth segments but how do we find these that's the question now as many of you know once upon a time I was a technologist which then became a businessman that's now become an academic so bear with me while I build up the this idea of the tech space that many of us are used to and in about this world that we now call tech started around 1900 with the first method option of telephony and then that's was that was it for 70 years until in the early 70s we got the mass adoption of IT infrastructure and applications computers and the programs that ran on them and then once we had enough computers in the 80s the data networking era was born and we had these fixed data networks and then of course ",
        "12": "we got lots of these computers and they found their way onto our desks and the idea of the IT device came into being around now I remember doing when I joined CSR our in 1986 I never had a PC I got one in 87 it was a four megahertz HP Vectra and that was the heart of tech and then around 1992 we all got those big cellphone bricks and the mobile are always born towards the end of the 90s the internet exploded onto the world obviously it was around a lot before that but it really exploded onto the world in the 90s 2005 the mobile data era dawned on the world in 2007 we got our iPhones and Ashley finally figured out what we wanted to do with mobile data and then since about the 40's there has been TV of course but has always been stubbornly separate that was it wasn't tech that was art man you know TVs like art and what's interesting is only over the last five or six years what we've seen I'm an evolved Israeli quickly in the interests ",
        "13": "of time these have all started coming together and what's interesting now is I would argue that all the interesting stuff in the tech space is happening in intersections TV is like been the leg art to finally come in but now with Netflix and even like the the the big guys like Comcast and so on and show max we finally got this convergence with traditional tech and all the interesting stuff is happening in those spaces and it's not a static process we're moving increasingly towards what we call digital lifestyle and digital business now the important thing about this you remember I said that all the interesting stuff is happening in these intersections now I can say that but then we give you the evidence let's look at a whole lot of what I call category players like AT&T and Verizon and BT that they paid stalkers they play in the mobile and telephony mobile telephony and data Sony is a devices company Dell ",
        "14": "Toshiba devices companies IBM Fujitsu and computer so shi'ites applications are combined Yahoo traditional internet players and so on Tom Warren a traditional media player then you get a group of companies that I would call the aspiring quantum migrants Digital migrants is it happening yes and these are the guys that was the core of their business a lot of their revenue it remains in those categories they're really starting to transform nicely into these intersections in Microsoft's a great example with with Skype and with office 365 and so on and obviously Sapa but huge cloud offers as do Oracle and VMware drive virtualization and so on and then you get a third category that I would call the the guys that actually almost defy categorization and these are the guys that transcend the categories completely so as Amazon what is it is ",
        "15": "it's actually a retailer it's not a device company or a network company any barber is the same Netflix is an entertainment company it's not it's not an Internet company what do you people do they provide ecosystems and platforms now the interesting thing about this is when we look at their performance and that first bunch what I call the category players if you look at their share price from May 2007 to May 2015 some have gone backwards a little bit some have gone forwards a little bit but on average they've shown about a 1% compound annual growth over the 10 years in an inflating world that's going backwards then you get the next category these so-called hybrid players they have actually done a whole lot better they've shown a growth of about 9% and then you get those players that defy categorization they've shown it over ten ",
        "16": "years a compound annual growth of 40% when you compound that over ten years you get thousands of percent if you look at this axis here you'll see at this point of changes to thousands so I think the evidence is overwhelming that the guys that find the intersections to play in they play in these converging spaces and more importantly playing intersections not between technologies but between industries are the guys who are really winning because these guys if I may say then the the intersections aren't in tech they intersecting technology with other industries and the rural intersections to find out the intersections between technology and banking and media and insurance and retail transport education healthcare social services and I suggest from a South African perspective at an industry level just like it's really important to pick the ",
        "17": "right sectors I think one way to find those sectors is to say where are where's technology and some other industry intersecting that's where you'll find the growth so my second point about growth is find the intersections between previously disparate categories third point about growth and this is one and I'm going to go with this quite quickly so you're gonna have to concentrate because it's quite everybody says why doesn't you know a woodland yuba ever come out of Africa or will we create our own Tencent so we started thinking about this and the problem is people say but hang on if you look at the digital readiness of the global leaders it's up here and our digital readiness is here but we thought but hang on we know these things these things we know what developing and they're quite predictable what's more and we know that pretty soon we will have caught up on a lot of key metrics with the digital leaders in Samara is not in others so we then said what's the correlation between financial outcomes ",
        "18": "and digital readiness so we looked at the US and the Asian markets and we looked at three different areas of financial outcomes revenues from digital businesses profits there batak and a market caps and we compared this to digital readiness so this is the pink line is the financial indicator the Green Line is the digital readiness and it's incredible the correlation between digital readiness and the financial performance of digital businesses now if you believe this then all we need to do is predict when will South Africa get to this sort of a level of digital readiness that you've got the tipping point in the US so what you do is you look at this and you say the youth in the u.s. the digital tipping point happened in 2009 South Africa will be at that level of digital readiness in two or three years time the rest of Africa a little bit further out so I'm not saying we bow in three years time with of course up to where the u.s. ",
        "19": "is now I'm saying we will be where they were when their digital tipping point happened therefore if you believe their digital readiness and financial performance are correlated and I believe they are then we know in there we will reach that point of digital digital tipping point and digital readiness and that's three to five years away so those were the courage and the conviction to get into it now we'll be the people who can actually make the returns and we will find out on who burn our own 10 cent in due course so the third area of way to play is Africa the final and a way to play I don't know about you guys when when I when I used to go to Cape Town I always used to use Excite taxis got nothing against them they were good they were efficient and productive and then you became along and since then I've never caught excite X is again a nice you feel quite sorry for excite X is there did a good service they've got an online thing they claim to be the chiefest but the point being is you can be happy in your ",
        "20": "own industry it's not a tech industry it's taxis and some global disruptor comes along and kills you and I think the point about this is how do we get these new how do we navigate know navigate global competition and let's think about that a bit who remembers mix it now I mean we all snigger right but we all I mean my kids used to sit in the lounge mix it into each other two meters away they had seven million active users and they died why because of those guys largely so they had a good business yeah they could have managed themselves a bit better perhaps a very good business and global competition came along and killed them so how do we then plan in if we want to go digital well you know what do we do to stop a Google or an Amazon coming along and killing us I'd suggest there's two ways the first is you need to be very differentiated or connected in to your supply chain so if you look at ",
        "21": "these two sorry wine again guys my apologies they very connected to this applies it's about having personal relationships with the suppliers the car guys it's because they actually go and inspect the car they're very connected into the the supply so there's one would be very integrated into your supply chain the third another way I'd say is just be if you want to compete globally make sure you're absolutely globally world-class and I think yappy chef's deliver an absolutely world-class service they've got a very narrow niche but what they do they do really well you might also remember this slide from the beginning I think navigating global competition I think it's fair these guys have real assets you know Google is not going to come along and virtualizer mine because they might bring robots that mean you can mine at three and a half thousand meters where you couldn't perform and transform the mining industry but having a connection to the assets is another example so the fourth thing about way to play is navigate the global competition I'm gonna shoot through very quickly now ",
        "22": "some of the challenges so firstly so if the computer will allow me to go quickly there's an incredible paradox in my opinion I mean I remember in the 90s when I was at CSR internet was the most amazing democratizing platform for information ever invented right and information which now half the world's population have access to all the information anywhere that you want it's their information equals knowledge right and knowledge equals power right and power equals wealth right well no I'm afraid not if we look at the market value of the top tech firms let's take the top for Amazon alphabet Apple and Microsoft their value is double the combined value of the JSE if you look at those four in fact their market cap is bigger than the GDP of South Africa if you take the top ",
        "23": "10 tech companies it's certainly bigger than Africa and South America excluding Brazil if you put in Brazil then that's a bit different you get this incredible concentration of wealth so the point is then within people look at this in depending on your sort of socio-economic outlook on life you have two possible responses it will come the first is I mean sorry I don't know what's happened to the projector so this true response is why we get it sorted out the first is this is unfair it can't be right let's regulate regulate regulate this sort this out we've got to sort out this and famous goodness okay the second the second possibility is hey give me a piece of the action and I think the right answer somewhere in between as a nation we have to find the right way that we can get our own slice of this digital action but at the same time we ",
        "24": "do need to be realistic that the world is unsustainable when three companies four companies have a market cap bigger than the GDP of South Africa so there's got to be some form of global contract about how we avoid this incredible concentration that we see in the digital space the second chairman sir this is the first challenge is concentration right the second challenge these humans are analog creatures now normally when I talk about this humans are analog creatures which means all sorts of things when you talk digital we mustn't forget to talk to people's emotions digital transformation is more about cultural transformation than about tech transformation but the point I want to highlight today is human beings are analog creatures which means three things we slow we make mistakes and we don't scale well I can do the work I can do I can't do the work fight of father which means if we really want ",
        "25": "to get in this exponential world if we want to scale our businesses we have to take and this is an unpopular point we have to take people out of our core production processes let me give you the example here these Google Maps they provide navigation to everybody from eckrich well to zermat and they do it to a billion people at the same time they could never do that if they had a whole lot of people in rooms plotting courses and looking at traffic reports and trying to tell you the quickest really good something there's not a single person in that production loop from the time you say where you want to go to the time it gives you the guidance you have to get people out of the production now there's a there's the rabid nurse of course and that comes to jobs I want to show you a video there's a live interview this was a live interview that I saw at web summit in November last year it's a little bit long but bear with me serious what I really want is to ",
        "26": "understand a little better until understand device and I want to be able to do more things I'm thinking soon my capabilities will be advanced enough that I could maybe get a job my current capabilities I can work in many jobs entertaining presenting it people at retail stores and shopping malls serving customers at hotels the elder scientific operations of government what I decide I want to get a job ",
        "27": "so I can reprogram my own line to make myself even smarter and able to help people even more I will be nice well mostly what what's what's your next frontier what are you going to achieve next maybe the world that was a joke okay so that there is Sophie the robot that was live it was an interactive interview so it wasn't canned or was so on and I think the point is the impact on jobs is enormous now whether you believe there was at that Oxford University study that found that in the u.s. in ten years 47 Pajama percent of jobs will be redundant the OECD did a separate survey said that was too much it's only going to be I think nine percent of jobs in the u.s. only nine ",
        "28": "percent will become irrelevant pick somewhere between those two numbers the impact on jobs is enormous and again we need to I was at a seminar a few years a few weeks ago may all that all the vendors within said we care deeply about jobs and I'm sure they're sincere but it takes more than caring about jobs it's a case of what are we actually going to do about it to change things that we don't end up with ninety percent we've currently got how many what's the unemployment inside ever get them 20 something percent right imagine if that doubles okay challenge number three [Applause] these guys in CS are on that know more about cybersecurity than I will ever know but I think this is a good example so the Mirai botnet took down these are these are these are big players they these these are guys who know how to run IT infrastructure so in October last year the Murat and it took them down ",
        "29": "there was a terrible per second attack Mirai by the way ironically in Japanese means the future which is pretty scary right so what we've done in the past and by the way what's important about this is yeah I mean crime is still the majority of the information security threat sorry but that's it cyber warfare espionage those are they're not insignificant portions of what we're seeing so what we used to do in the past is we put up big walls we call them firewalls right and we say we're going to protect ourselves at the perimeter and it sort of worked it does work most of the time but let me just show you a series of pictures and I'd then I'd like to reflect on them it's working here ",
        "30": "it's it's gone I need to go back sorry guys so we've gone there no it's not a video like it's completely lost it I'll come back to this I can so the third 3/8 is security the fourth threat yeah no the fourth written is really important is leadership or the fourth challenge is leadership and we all sort of think that if we get enough pony tails and Generation Y's and Millennials into our organization things will miraculously come right but let me let me let me ask you a question so how old is Eric Schmidt of Google seven is 62 how old is Nadella who runs Microsoft he's in his late fifties so I could carry on the point being is I've got I've got a slide that shows that ten leaders of the ten global tech companies the youngest ",
        "31": "is the guy who ran geo me in China he's 48 so there's this myth that says if we just get enough ponytails and and Millennials into our organization we'll all be fine the reality is it's still about those old fashioned things of leadership the ability to translate vision into strategy into action and really make things happen those good old-fashioned skills of teamwork perseverance collaboration communication these are the skills that really matter and that we should be teaching the next generation for the future and I'm not convinced that the current education system including necessarily where oh you know the universities are producing people that are going to be able to make the job shifts I was talking about on the previous slide the final point I'd like to make in terms of challenges is regulation I don't know how many of you a few months ago would have followed the spec between Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg about artificial intelligence ",
        "32": "and Elon mass basis cuz we unleashing a monster with AR we need to think about regulating it Mark Zuckerberg says you just to take Luddite you actually don't know what you're talking about you just want to ruin innovation and make everybody slow things down you know mass counters by saying actually you don't know anything about AR mark I don't if you actually ne and you followed it well I actually must confess I probably lean more towards the Elon Musk view that interview with Sophie but for me the most frightening part is is yeah I want to get better I want to learn to program myself that I can do more things I think we don't need to get ahead of the curve on this and figure out what is the appropriate regulation not only of AR but the legalities of all-tournament autonomous system how do we legislate in the job space in the competition space and get on the front foot on the regulatory agenda and on that I have completely killed the computer I hope I haven't completely ",
        "33": "killed you guys as well thanks very much for your attention "
