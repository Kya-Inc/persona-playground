        "0": "you know look I think as a as a CEO we want to basically just have a clear rule book right and if a clear rules are published we're happy to follow it and if those rules change you know we're happy to follow those Brian Armstrong is fast becoming perhaps the most prominent and important figure in crypto he could also be the industry's best hope for convincing politicians in the United States to draft regulations that enable it to flourish in the land of the free he's built one of crypto's most recognizable and successful Brands while simultaneously managing to stay well sometimes in the right people's good books so in today's video I'm going to explore who Brian Armstrong is where he came from where he's headed and why what he says and does over the next few months could shape the future of crypto now Brian will be familiar to almost everyone watching this as the co-founder and CEO of coinbase the biggest crypto Exchange in the US and the only one so far that's gone on to become a public company we'll talk more about coinbase ",
        "1": "going public a little later on because it is a big big deal Brian grew up in San Jose California and fell in love with computers while still a kid in an interview late last year he described his childhood thus quote I liked technology I just found it fascinating I was kind of a night owl too so I somehow ended up staying up until 2AM every morning just playing on my computer reading things when I eventually got the internet I was just endlessly fascinated consuming different things and I was a zombie in the mornings and tried to get through school and get passing grades basically now despite the anti-social hours and questionable approach to his schooling Brian went on to graduate from Rice University in Texas with a masters in computer science that was in 2006. after leaving University he spent some time in Argentina where he saw firsthand the effects of rampant inflation before going on to work for the likes of IBM ",
        "2": "Deloitte and Airbnb as a software engineer then in 2009 he read the Bitcoin white paper now back in those early days getting your hands on bitcoin wasn't easy unless you knew how to mine it or knew someone who did you didn't have that many other options this changed with the arrival of Mount gox which began Life as a trading platform for Magic the Gathering cards but was then repurposed to become a Bitcoin exchange this made Bitcoin relatively accessible to regular people for the first time and mount gox was soon accounting for the vast majority of Bitcoin trading volume that said the exchange was notoriously unreliable and unsafe and many people were wary of it and rightly so for as we now know the story of Mount gox does not have a happy ending indeed as its creditors are at the time of filming still waiting for ",
        "3": "them their money back well it doesn't yet have an ending at all anyway Brian was keenly aware that buying Bitcoin wasn't an easy or stress-free process and his bright idea was to rectify this so in 2012 he launched coinbase in partnership with an ex-goldman sex Trader named Fred ursum in actual fact Brian had first begun working on coinbase with another Bitcoin Enthusiast named Ben Reeves but the two fell out shortly after being accepted into the prestigious y combinator startup School the issue was over whether coinbase should be custodial or not Ben felt that users should retain the private keys to their crypto while Brian wanted the platform itself to fulfill this function Ben went on to found another company blockchain.com which today functions as a kind of crypto financial services company one of Ben's future hires would be a young Canadian by the name of Chang Peng Zhao I wonder whatever happened to him anyway shortly after parting ways ",
        "4": "with Ben Brian recruited Fred and coinbase went live in November 2012. incidentally fact fans the name coinbase is derived from a bit of Bitcoin terminology when a miner creates a block to add to the Bitcoin blockchain the first transaction in that blog which Awards the lucky Miner their block reward and fees is known as the coinbase transaction now the story of coinbase's ascent to the Pinnacle of the crypto industry is a fascinating one as you might expect for a company that's gone from a startup to being listed on the NASDAQ in under a decade and in an industry that is itself only 14 years old the journey has been a bumpy one it's told in detail in this book by journalist Jeff John Roberts and when you read of the long hours and the battles with authorities hackers Rivals customers colleagues crypto Bros the media and plenty more besides it becomes harder to begrudge by Ryan his ",
        "5": "multi-billion dollar Fortune seriously while the money is great running a crypto exchange is not a job for the faint-hearted and because most people's primary interactions with crypto are through exchanges like coinbase and others exchange CEOs have become some of the most powerful recognizable and scrutinized people in the industry as such they're finding themselves willingly or unwillingly to be key figures in the ongoing arguments over regulation and crypto's place in the world now one in particular seemed willing to step up to the plate and fight crypto's Corner in Washington DC until it came to light that he was well not quite what the industry needed and his Empire was built on Sand quite literally seeing as FTX was based in the Bahamas yes Sam bankmanfreed seemed to be the poster child for the crypto industry in the US and Beyond and his quite spectacular Fall From Grace seems to have pushed Brian further into the ",
        "6": "spotlight and it looks like he's starting to become more comfortable in this role despite being a self-professed introvert happiest in front of his computer and who apparently would sit for hours working with his headphones on rather than talking to his colleagues and employees Brian now seems increasingly more at ease with being a public figure he's certainly become more visible in recent months having in the past been reluctant to do many interviews he's now becoming a much more regular figure in the mainstream media meanwhile like any true crypto bro he's also an active voice on Twitter with over a million followers and Counting he's also the charitable type 2 having signed up to the giving pledge back in 2018 thereby promising to give most of his money away to good causes stop me if you've heard that one somewhere before anyhow in that same interview I quoted from earlier Brian had this to say about stepping ever more into the public eye quote I'm happy to play that role and ",
        "7": "I'm happy to go do all the things like appearing before Congress and interviews and TV when I need to but that's not going to be my primary focus my primary focus is going to be how do we build better products for our customers now that is all well and good but as crypto's image problem persists in the wake of SPF Brian is likely to find himself needing to spend more time on TV and on Capitol Hill the crypto industry in the US needs a high profile spokesperson who isn't staring down the barrel of a multi-decade jail term and Brian is looking more and more like the best candidate for that role he's built coinbase into not only the biggest U.S exchange but he's also taken it public a huge achievement for a company in an industry that's viewed with such outright hostility by so many powerful people coinbase has faced and continues to face many many challenges and the performance of its stock hasn't always been a joy to behold but Brian has ",
        "8": "successfully steered it through a turbulent decade yes coinbase has had to pay multiple fines deal with staff walkouts and endure the Fallout from Rogue employees some product launches haven't gone quite to plan the SEC is likely to come for its staking service before too long and it's been forced to lay off staff as the bear Market has bitten but other U.S exchanges are also feeling the heat Jesse Powell recently stepped down as CEO of Kraken itself recently body slammed by the SEC while over at Gemini the Winklevoss twins are embroiled in the Fallout from the Genesis dcg Fiasco meanwhile while figures like Kristen Smith at the blockchain association and senator lamis of Wyoming have worked tirelessly to plead crypto's case in Washington perhaps the best person to represent the industry is the shy kid from San Jose who has built a multi-billion dollar company from scratch in just 12 years ",
