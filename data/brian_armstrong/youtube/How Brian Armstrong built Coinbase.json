        "1": "access to people they remember always kind of get access to uh in other ways and just ask Brian anything so I'll go for 20 25 minutes and then you need to get asked brand questions but maybe you know right maybe Brian one good place to start off is and we've done a few of these before I don't think I asked you this um right before this you're talking about the hero's journey and every hero is in origin and as I was thinking about today what struck me was about maybe 10 11 years ago you were probably in a similar setting at y combinator so kind of take us back to the origin of coinbase and how it how did you feel when you were in the audience in kind of a similar way as everyone here yeah so I was definitely in your shoes back in 2010 I had read the Bitcoin white paper I had tried doing a startup in the in the tutoring and education space um it was kind of like a base hit didn't really go very well and I joined Airbnb as an early employee to try to learn more about how to do a startup and so I kept thinking I really want to do another startup I want to I want to do another startup and um I eventually read ",
        "2": "that Bitcoin white paper and I started to think more and more about it so nights and weekends I was kind of working on a prototype I I wasn't sure about myself I didn't really know if this was the thing I wanted to go do but I applied to Y combinator and that's the first time somebody actually told me maybe you're not crazy like this this whole Bitcoin thing is not complete nuts maybe we'll write you a little seed check and and get off the ground so I was this was probably 2012. I decided to quit my job join White combinator and I was exactly in maybe some some of the feelings are very similar to how you're feeling right now um I didn't I definitely didn't feel like anything was for sure I felt like this was a very high risk Endeavor um I didn't really know if any of it was going to work out I felt like maybe I have a shot at something working here but it's going to have to have to a lot of cards are gonna have to flip over the right way and a lot of hard work is going to have to happen I was struggling to find anybody who would join my team and work with me you know the early stages it's impossible to find people to join you on these crazy Journeys sometimes um there was I almost co-founded it with ",
        "3": "one person and that all exploded in dramatic fashion you might have had co-founder issues that's like kind of the norm um finally found the right co-founder we got off from Fred ursum we got Off to the Races you know someone sued us like three weeks three three months later he was just so startups are moving from one setback to the next with enthusiasm and if it's a complete show and it's chaos and nothing is working that's kind of the default state so you're doing it right if it feels like that um and basically you just don't give up like that's that's the main thing a lot of times I've seen people they TR they have an idea they have a team that comes together they launch their first thing it doesn't work you know and four months later they have some big co-founder fight and they blow up and they all they all go home and it's like well you didn't really try it you know because there's no there's no idea that works on the first try you have to put something out there and then grind it out like two or three years usually to sort of talk to your customers improve the product talk to your customers improve the product and ",
        "4": "sometimes um it never works and sometimes you break through after n number of years and the last thing I'll say and I'll turn back to you is if you look at almost every successful startup it feels like it was an overnight success but really that's just how history gets written in hindsight like in if you talk to most of those Founders in the early days there was a period where any reasonable person would have quit nothing was working they were in credit card debt you know um like they were being sued it was like and and all of them somehow persevered and pushed through and finally found something that started to get working and then the next thing and then the next thing so we can talk about all kinds of lessons but um that's my memory of that time you know I'm not in fact that because you know we are in a you know a bad Market crypto winter whatever you want to uh call it and I want to go back and I don't remember the you know how the market was but it's not crypto it's not a sure thing at that time we're probably far from a sure thing and you had been at Airbnb you could have kind of there's an alternative Multiverse Brian Armstrong who's like a VP of ",
        "5": "engineering at a fan company and doing pretty well so you could probably always quit and gone back to that so when you say don't give up in those first six months to a year what kept you going yeah well okay so I I don't think I was really the smartest person I met lots of people who were smarter than me I don't think I was even that good at raising money to be honest I met other people who were much better at that frederson's better at raising money than I was um but what I was was very determined um and so I guess I guess I just made a decision at a certain point and I said you know what I'm just gonna go all out on this thing for the next two three four years and if it doesn't work I will know that I left everything on the field and I will go back and figure it out but I'm not going to quit before then and I actually made a pact with um in y combinator there was a batch a talk kind of like this and I remember somebody I think with Sam Altman he came up and was telling us how to not die or whatever and um I made a pact with one of the other uh teams there and we said ",
        "6": "we're gonna I put a calendar invite in our calendars for two years in the future and I said if we're if we're both still working on our company two years from now we will drink a bottle of champagne together um in San Francisco Bay and if either one of us has quit they have the minute they quit in the next two years they have to buy a bottle of Dom Perignon for this other person so a lot of people quit two years into that I'd say probably like 50 60 of the companies in our batch they didn't exist anymore um and me and that other guy we actually we did drink the bottle of champagne we were both it was Founders fund which is another company that still exists and we bought the champagne well we were both still working on our company so I think we both bought whatever but it was it was just a cycle it was a psychological thing we were kind of like burn the ships we're going all in we're not going to quit and we're going to work 110 on this every day now the other part which is and I want to tie it back to the folks here is looking back and say the first two three years of coinbase if you could have a do-over and you'll be like hey these are things that I would go back and do ",
        "7": "exactly the same way again I would change nothing and maybe these are some things I would maybe want to take back and change yeah obviously things kind of obviously worked out really well like what do we think you'd keep and what we think you would change yeah I'll start with the ones I would keep um maybe a little easier so I think one thing is that we waited to hire we were actually pretty slow to higher so I mean first I couldn't find the right co-founder for a long time so um and then Fred Fred joined and we didn't we didn't go try to build a big team really quick I think we had raised maybe 600k in the seed round um but we kept interviewing people we were meeting people but we didn't hire anybody and we had a ridiculously high bar um we had this saying we said if you're not a hell yes you're a no and the absence of red flags in a candidate was not a reason to hire them you had to be you had to leave more excited than when you went in you had to believe that this person was way better than you at something maybe you didn't even want to work for them someday so people have these sets of questions they ask themselves so we kept a very high ",
        "8": "bar on hiring we waited a long time um what else another thing we did was we I avoided going to conferences I avoided going to talks um I avoided just networking with random people like I was we were kind of obsessive all we did was we worked on the product and talked to customers um and then we did it again we worked on the product and we talked to customers and there's a lot of things you can feel like you're working in a startup that are kind of like fake work um and they're really not helping you get closer to your objective and I I'll share one little quick anecdote maybe that helps people understand that and then I'll talk about the things that we didn't do as well um so I launched the first you know version of coinbase and there was no way to buy and sell crypto by the way in the first version of coinbase it was just a hosted Bitcoin wallet and I remember uh we put I put it on Reddit or something like that we got like a couple hundred people who came in and used it and then they would all leave and nobody was using it that's kind of the default ",
        "9": "state of every product that you ever launch is you know you get the tech crunch of initiation and then flat so following the advice of Y combinator I was like all right talk to your customers so I just emailed five of the people who signed up I was like hey I built this app can I get your feedback so I got on the phone with like three or four of them and I was like um I noticed you didn't come back why did why didn't you use the app and the guy was like well I mean I thought the app was pretty cool but I don't actually even really have any Bitcoin I just I just wanted to check it out and I remember had this like light bulb kind of went off in my head and was like well if there was like a simple way to buy it in the app would you have done that he's like yeah probably and so I hung up and the next few months I had to start to think about how do we build a simple buy button and there was a million things that had to go into that and Bank partners and legal like licensing and all this kind of stuff but that now that kick that's when we finally got product Market fit and that was just one example of like hundreds of times where I did that and I was trying to find something that worked something that worked something that worked so talk to your customers improve the product that's all we did and that was ",
        "10": "one of the things I would recommend um let's see what didn't work yeah look at the fun stuff yeah um let's see I think um there's periods where you know kind of the opposite of advice I just said we were we hired too fast I mean I'd say in 2021 2022 I you know we got like a little too exuberant and grew the head count too fast and so had to make some head con reductions I'd say anytime you're cut you know this is maybe a more of a scaled thing if you're if you're like two people and you find product Market fit you can you can grow 10 people or something like that in a year so that'd be like a 5x but if you're at scale and you try to 5x I mean you're gonna completely blow up to company like all communication culture decision making will break down so I'd probably I probably would have hired slower in that kind of gross environment in the future um I mean another thing that I would say is that I feel like if I if I had if I put myself back where in 2012 knowing what I know now I feel ",
        "11": "like I might have been able to grow coinbase twice as fast okay um well there's a couple things this is like classic advice that people gave me and I thought I understood it but I didn't actually go far enough well I mean one of the things people always said was um you know you actually have to delegate and stop like doing the work yourself at a certain point when we were like 20 people or 25 and I was basically writing code for like 60 of my time um and I was having trouble letting go of that to actually bring in other people to to go do more of the actual work and I remember one of our investors came to me one time and he's like what percent of your time are you are you spending writing code every day and I was like I don't know maybe 50 or 60 and he was like this company is never going to grow unless you unless you figure out how to delegate that stuff and um I had to kind of eventually let go of that I don't know that's that's one example that comes to mind it's interesting because I think sometimes you know so I've seen people go the other way which is they delegate too quickly and you have to remove and they're like lose touch with ",
        "12": "the actual realities or how things work in the company yeah um okay I want to it's possible to mess it up both ways oh yeah yeah I agree oh yeah well yeah one thing I love about Brian is and by the way folk 17 the brand has a lot of podcasts and content out there and you should watch him because you are and I'm not saying just to flatter you uh you're you're kind of already self aware person and you're very transparent about who you are uh in which I think a lot of other CEOs are not which I always admire and so when you look back in that era or maybe even the last 10 years what kind of when you look at a CEO what are skills behaviors that you were like hey you were just naturally born with and you were good at and other skills and behaviors which you maybe had to learn or hire around or painfully realize that you didn't have that because I think this is something which always been a little transparent about and always enjoyed hearing that yeah yeah sure I mean I so I think the things that I was naturally good at was I was just very even keeled so it's just kind of my personality like I mean I I feel like stressed at times for sure and I can talk about how to manage stress if people want to but ",
        "13": "um I think that the world might be blowing up and you know the site is down and like people are upset with us and we're getting sued and usually my mindset is just like okay great like how do we solve it you know and then by the way the flip side of that is when things are going really well sometimes people are like why why aren't you happier like why aren't you celebrating and I'm just like I don't know this is my happy face whatever um so I'm just like very even keeled um and then you know I was analytical I was an engineer so those were sort of the natural things but I was not good at being a CEO in other ways I mean I had never managed anybody um and so I had to learn that and I had a number of like executive coaches and people like that who sort of helped me learn a little bit of people management um I was not I don't think I was very confident as like a public speaker or even externally um like in fundraising situations and stuff like that I was always very I actually when I was in my 20s I went to like Toastmasters which was like a public speaking club I'm not even sure if I'd recommend it it was okay but like I was just trying anything at this at that point to try to learn how to stand ",
        "14": "in front of an audience and like speak and you might be wondering right now maybe he seems like he's speaking fine but you know I'm this is like the thousandth time I've done it over the last 10 years so it's like um you can get better anything with reps but I'm talking about early on um let's see I mean what else was I not good at um I mean nobody's good at everything so you have to find people to compliment you right like it's sort of I actually really believe in this idea of like double down on your strengths and don't try to get good at the you know you can turn like a a d-minus into like a c plus but you can't turn it into an A so um you know that's like coinbase wouldn't have existed if I didn't find other people around me to that complimented my skill sets exactly yeah it's true for human I think the firm at ACDC like Mark Ben Chris you know one of the things like we want to find sorry Avengers and then you want to have them amplify the superpowers because I've never seen every become successful by mitigating that you know fixing their weaknesses yeah right you always try and stand out in the thing that you are ",
        "15": "really unique at yeah okay I want to get to some of the you know some of the maybe darker moments of coinbase or you know some of the harsh militias you talk about even Keel through I guess sorry I had one final thought on that which is that I actually had like a lot of self-doubt about whether I could even be a CEO to be honest and maybe I don't know if it's helpful for people but um I mean I thought of myself as an engineer right and I was like really introverted um and I had this Vision in my head of like CEOs are these kind of like military generals that like bark orders that people and like charge that hill and this and that and there was like I always ran into these like really charismatic people and I was like mad like how do they do that and so I thought maybe I wouldn't be a good CEO but what I realized eventually was that there's lots of different kinds of CEOs like I've now I've met CEOs that are like amazing at sales and Market they're just Geniuses on that like in marketing and then there's people who are like operational experts and then there's people who are deeply Technical and then there's people who are really charismatic leaders and so you can really be any kind of CEO you want ",
        "16": "um and it was funny for a long time I even had trouble like saying I'm the CEO like I had I just felt like weird to me I was like yeah I'm an engineer who's like currently doing the CEO job or something I had all these like weird ways of saying it and it took me like four years or something to just be like oh yeah I'm like I'm the CEO of the company and it sounds strange but anyway you you can just uh basically make it all that stuff is really true well you know I think a lot of people you know a lot of us have some original imposter syndrome right and a lot of yeah it's gonna do was it a moment which got you to be like you know what I'm actually comfortable with this role I can actually say I'm CEO without having to think about it was that a magic moment in there somewhere or just take time I mean the thing that I realized about myself another thing is that I really like in addition to liking building things I liked learning things and the way you learn things is like you put yourself a little outside your comfort zone so I kind of treated every situation and by the way being a co-founding company or a Building Company it's constantly putting yourself outside your comfort zone where you know you're gonna like almost every week ",
        "17": "something happens where you know I've never done it before where if I tried if I tried doing my average day today five years ago it would be like completely overwhelming um but every time you do it you get stronger and so I just I started to appreciate the idea of feeling a little outside my comfort zone like that was a good day like oh man I got to talk to you know one of the most uncomfortable thing you remember from that era where you were pushed or save your comfort zone um well so I remember like this wouldn't be like that out of the ordinary today but like at that time something that was um remember like a like a stressful day or something would be like okay my head of engineering came in and quit and not only did he quit he's like this thing is up and it's never going to work and so um like this guy's quitting with me too I'm like okay great um and then um and then you got that note by the way yeah right now well yeah I mean everybody go on their own path but I mean and then you know the next thing would be like um ",
        "18": "oh the site is offline and like we just lost like forty thousand dollars uh for this customer and then um you know we just got sued by this person and um oh by the way like we have to evacuate the building and no no one got any lunch today and everyone's pissed about we don't like so just like a series of things like that um but now you know now I'm more thinking about like Congressional testimony and you know whatever um leveled up yeah so that's how I started to think of that as like actually kind of fun in a weird way which was like learning and pushing yourself outside the comfort zone um I want to talk about you being level-headed doing your successful time because one of the interesting stuff that I want to talk about is one of the crypto Winters where you had a significant person of your company quit yeah and you know talk to us about that because that is a situation which a lot of companies do not come back from cues don't come back from what happened what did you do during it yeah well I mean you're all aware that crypto's gone ",
        "19": "through many cycles and I think that what was that period it was like 2015 to 2017 or something like that um that was a pretty long winter there and I remember a lot of the other companies in the space um they had pivoted to sort of blockchain um and they were building like software for banks and stuff like that and you know the first like year people were kind of like all right we're gonna try something after a year 18 months people started to get really disillusioned I mean people started resigning they were like even finding ways to like sell their stock in the private markets and stuff like that and um I remember I think we had about like 25 attrition that year wow 20 maybe 25 crazy yeah like it's also because the rest of the techcom industry was kind of going about normally right and yeah we're off here you know potentially in a decision where your company could have died yeah and this is like one of the challenges of course as a Founder is like you often you know you're reading all this stuff too and you're like I don't know nothing's working like I'm feeling kind of down about it but then you want to kind of get in front of the company and try to put on a good face because you're ",
        "20": "kind of worried like those three people are going to quit and then like what are you going to do and um so it's this one thing I realized is like you can't just go up there and people because they can kind of see through it or at least for me they could um and I I realized like there's actually good power in as in a leader in being vulnerable right so I tried to just kind of lean into that and like go up in front of the team and be like things kind of suck you know like I'm I'm not feeling good about it like this thing I saw that really pissed me off to be honest and like I'm really worried about this and and now at least they're thinking okay well at least he's not like out to lunch he's like kind of you know and and and then and then it's like don't feel like you have to have all the answers too like the leader leadership is about bringing the teams together to help so it's like so here's what we're gonna do about it I wanna I wanna meet with these five people after this and we're gonna come up with a strategy on X and then and why and sort of bring them into the solution right and say like hey I want you to come present what you think we should do about this on Friday in other words I don't have a I don't ",
        "21": "have a clue what to do but like now now at least they feel involved in like coming creating the solution instead of just like everybody looking to you to be like what is Brian gonna do you know so these little things kind of helped us get through it um and frankly at that point I was like if we have to Pivot this company just build software for banks like I don't really want to do that so maybe we'll just I'd rather give the money back to the investors and just shut it down than to go do that so it we're staying with crypto and then it turned out to be a great decision obviously because when everybody else pivoted and then we came out of it stronger um so one thing that also about coinbase is you know you folks are kind of expanded into multiple different categories over the years uh you know multiple adjacencies Etc and I think a lot of times you know companies the question companies have is how do I expand and expand could in any number of things it could be expand to an adjacent product line it could be a new market you know maybe a different tier any number of things so you know as you can you folks have expanded in multiple different ways over the years obviously you know the coinbase when I was rated from the coinbase of 10 years ago how did you maybe walk us through ",
        "22": "one or two key expansion and how we went about that yeah well this is always a constant topic that comes up inside companies because it's another one of those things where you can mess it up on either side you know you can basically become so distracted that you try to do a million things and then you do none of them well and this is a common thing people say about Focus the value of focus and Steve Jobs had that great one about saying no you know a thousand times or whatever it was on the other side if the industry is really you know moving towards some new thing and you don't do it then you can be a one-hit wonder company and have basically a culture of incrementalism that we just optimize this one thing that we happen to found at work that we never get to the next thing and the next thing think about Netflix staying on DVD rentals or something instead of streaming or whatever a favorite example you want so I realized early on that it was funny sometimes in the exact same day I'd get one group of employees telling me like why are we doing so many goddamn things like we should focus on this and then the next meeting I'd be in there'd be like how how the hell do we not have ",
        "23": "like an nft project like this is obviously like this huge thing right so we came up with this framework we call it like 70 2010 and actually we borrowed this from Google we didn't even come up with it but it's like basically a resource allocation methodology 70 of the resources are on the core thing which makes most your Revenue 20 is on these adjacent bets 10 are on Venture bets which are you know really ambitious high risk if they work it's great they most of them don't um and that's allowed us to sort of have some some irons in the fire on big potential future things while also not losing focus on the core um coinbase today does have kind of a lot of products I mean it's like 10 or 12 depending on how you count it some of them are more like features and products but um I like it and for me it's exciting to like always be trying to build new things argue there's no one right way to do it I mean some CEOs would probably say we should be more focused I don't know I kind of like having the portfolio of bets and just as an example like USD coin the stablecoin um is something that you know we started ",
        "24": "with like a two-person team we just started working on that and it's turned out to be a major Revenue driver for us in this down market so you never really know what the things are that are going to do well and and which ones that don't um so I like kind of having a portfolio okay I want to get to you know a recent years and one of the last two years when I think about coinbase one of the critical moments was your post on being a mission driven company you know doing obviously all the events of I think 2020 uh early 2020 rather so talk to us about that because I in some ways uh I think how you handle that what you went through kind of shift to the Overton window and then obviously so many other sometimes something gets memed into existence and you see other companies adapt that and I see a lot of other companies now we're like we are mission oriented Mission focused so talk to us about what led up to that and you know what being Mission focused means yeah so some of you may end up going through this shift at your companies which is that um when we started off I mean we were 20 people 50 people you know all in in ",
        "25": "office a space like this and we all knew each other we know we knew what everyone was working on and we all felt very aligned and it's kind of like you know dunbar's numbers 150 people I don't know if you've ever seen seen that and we started to get to maybe like a little over 150 like 200 300 400 and I noticed for the first time by the way we started to be on different floors of the building or maybe even like in office in New York or like people started to feel a little divided and I started to notice um basically like factions almost started to develop within the company where people started to say you know I'm not I'm not on team coinbase I'm on like coinbase New York uh or I'm on like coinbase uh wallet or like and they're even starting to people started to make this Swag like the t-shirts and stuff that would say coinbase wallet and at one point this is probably a little extreme but I actually banned all swag that that didn't just say coinbase like you couldn't be like I'm on like the coinbase design team or something it's like you we're all in one team right yeah they're getting ready right there yeah exactly um so if you ever see a t-shirt that's coinbase something else learn it it's more rare but ",
        "26": "um so okay so anyway you know obviously the events of the around the world weren't happening at that point and like one thing we would always do an open q a in front of the company um kind of like we're going to do later here and when it got to be 500 people like 800 people something shifted in the company where it started to feel a little bit more like um we weren't all on the same team I was you know like some politician they were holding accountable or it became a little bit like social media or something like that where um people were chatting in slack and like just you know over text like all Nuance gets lost it's kind of like a social media flame war and basically the company kept getting into these fights and distractions and the questions that I was getting in the Q a were not about the product we're building or the mission or um you know the challenges we were having with competition and things like that it was like it was like Brian what do you think about um XYZ like social issue in the world and you know why did somebody say this you know do you agree with it or whatever and ",

        "58": "you know that's to me that's sort of a sign of like mutual respect almost of like wow I really trust that person I'm they're going to make me want to try harder because like they're they're like excelling and they're they're really impressive in various ways I remember um so Fred and I he he had reached out when he saw the Prototype and we started he just came in and tried working together for a little bit I remember um after a few months like some some interesting stuff happened where um like I remember one day he came to me he was like I've been I've been reading through all the stuff we've been doing about how to make this buy Bitcoin feature and um I'm pretty sure we're going to lose money on every trade and I'm like how can that be I don't that can't be right and he like walked me through it on the Whiteboard and I was like oh my God he's right and um so I would say people who are who challenge you on your ideas and occasionally they um they're right or they change your mind um that that's a good sign and um if you're if you haven't found a co-founder my best advice is like just keep making progress and eventually ",
        "59": "signs of success will cause the right person to show up like before I before coinbase got actually officially into YC and you know before I met Fred I I think for like a year or two I was like trying to find a co-founder and I just completely failed like and I was I tried co-founding with a couple people like this one guy for briefly and it didn't work out um and I was just like this sucks like I'm never gonna find a co-founder and um but getting into YC launching the Prototype and like randomly Fred messaged me one day so like yeah just don't stop making progress and eventually the right person will reach out to you thank you Ryan all right come on hey um David from disco here um I'm curious um what you're most excited for in decentralized Social and also how you see the opportunities for coinbase as a sort of mass consumer app in that space yeah well I mean that's a big topic so I think decentralized social is pretty cool from a few a few different angles ",
        "60": "one is that there's a lot of you know it allows people to avoid censorship right it allows people to build different uis that um like if you have if you want to have like a safe mode that tries to filter out a lot of like um you know difficult content or whatever you want to call it then you should be able to have that if you want to just look at the raw stream of stuff I think you should also be able to see that so it it allows people to sort of um for information to be free from like a freedom of speech point of view I think it's really powerful from a um you know not having all your stuff owned by big tech companies point of view it's really powerful um I think I don't know my guess is it'll it'll unlock new types of business models for creators as well so that's pretty cool but honestly this is like something that I'm spending like probably two percent of my time thinking about it if you're in that space here some of you all here are probably actually further along than I am on it thank you yeah I think the two the most important thing for the decent and social partner is like one obviously ",
        "61": "kind of you know censorship antisense system that's interesting but there was an error maybe 10 12 years ago when you could build apis you had apis on pretty much every social media company and you could build clients experiences and be really bent away from that right because of the ads based model and the kind of the centralized effects of these companies and for me if you look at something like a forecaster or lens or there's a bunch of others the idea that anybody can go build a client or go build an experience with no permission uh that is really really critical uh the fact that you can actually have the right to exit so you can sort of it's really you know what I think the internet should have been going all the way back like when we're teenagers like anybody who built on top of sntp or anybody could build a Twitter client for a period of years or a Facebook client so it's kind of that appeal of permissionless innovation which I think like super interesting yeah but it feels it feels totally right to me I actually can't predict exactly what's going to happen there but something about it seems awesome which is which is a good indicator of like a fruitful ground for ideas kind of the early energy of like 2004 or 2005 Ajax web 2 or the 90 yeah right it has kind of the same energy I don't know and of course ",
        "62": "it's super early and you know who knows what's going to happen but it does have that sort of that nerd energy which I love yeah okay I think there's a lot of questions in the audience before I let you go maybe what is maybe one parting thought you have for this these four a lot of them are super early in their Journey badly started the company some of them are further along what is like one final thing you'd like to tell them hmm um well I already told you my nugget about like don't die basically and just um you need to grind it out like two three four years to like see if something breaks through otherwise you haven't really tried it so that's the first one I guess the last one I'll leave you with is like this is a great phrase which I like which is action produces information so sometimes if you're you can't really see that many moves ahead on the chess board and you're like I don't know he's like these these centralized social or gaming gonna be big or whatever it's like if you don't know what to do just like do anything because um action will produce more information so just like build something it's almost certainly the wrong thing but by by the ",
        "63": "fact that you just built it you then will see oh I should have done this or somebody reaches out to you and like your app sucks but I wish you had done why or like you know just action-produces information keep moving you know startups are like sharks if they stop swimming they die so yeah don't die buildings ladies and gentlemen I'm sorry [Applause] [Music] "
