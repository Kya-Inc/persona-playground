        "0": "hi folks you know it's fascinating this conversation around digital is actually as dynamic as the subject matter itself in the five years I've been talking about digital it's gone from being so far out there to over the hill every consultancy now is a digital practice business media devotes pages and pages to it we're in our companies we've got digital projects here and there many of us have chief digital officer so everybody's talking about it most people are doing it and a few are actually doing it well so good morning again folks I'm I'm also actually a BA I'm not the BA that Caroline spoke to earlier spoke about earlier that can't get it up I'm Brian Armstrong as Ryan said I'm a businessman with about 30 years experience running big companies but I'm also a professor of digital business at ",
        "1": "the vets Business School and once upon a time I was a scientist so I actually understood about 10% of what Audrianna said and so now people call me a business scientist and what I try to do is unpack and make sense of this thing called digitalization and we now look at it often we find that our digital strategies look a bit like this we're in this pantry full of all these cool ingredients and goodies but what we lack is the recipes and the techniques to translate these ingredients into a great meal and we like a strategy which translates a quarter a single dish into a great overall experience of eating in a fine restaurant and if we stay in this place of just having this jumble of ideas we actually not going to go very far if I look at these are took a group of global leading companies that have done really well at what they've always done but they've gone no way they have ",
        "2": "shown a growth of about one percent over the last 10 years this is actual share price data if we look at a different group of companies that has worked hard on transforming their businesses to become digital businesses they've should they done much better they've shown a compound growth to about 10 percent but if we look at the true digital players those guys are actually what I call the digital natives of the convergent digital players they've delivered incredible results 40 percent compound performance over ten years thousands of percent growth over the period the question is what can we learn from them what are they doing right now over the last ten years or so I've had the privilege as a technology provided to them of speaking to captains of industry and leaders of business in South Africa and Beyond about what are they doing in their businesses on their digital journey what's working what's not working and as the chief operating officer of Telkom I've done it to myself but at the same time the science system is a bit worried because there's a lot of hottie in this field of digitalization is that it's all based on anecdote and unsubstantiated stories so ",
        "3": "at the same time I try to probe what is the substance of digital and put it together in a robust more scientifically rigorous model and as this blend of practical real-world make it happen experienced but built on a solid foundation and understanding of what digital really is that I try to bring to my conversation around digital and I start off by saying that digital isn't primarily about the tick the tick is important but digital is actually the intersection of technology with transforming society and new ways of doing business and this intersection is what makes it so powerful understanding what it is though it's only a first step we need to figure out what to do about it and for that we need a strategy and strategy at its most simple is where choices we make about where to play and in how to win and in my talk I unpack four areas about thinking about where to play and 10 a cape point checklist of 10 points about how to win so folks my conversation on digitalization isn't to ",
        "4": "talk about the future about change is coming and how big it's going to be I think that is a given what I talk about is what to do about it starting now and I'd love to be a part of the conversation at one of your future events very good so Brian I think the first thing as you're talking and I and I think it's important to make it clear is is when we talk about digitization or digitalization we get the sense that okay you must be talking about technology businesses you know the the ISPs internet and cell phones and that sort of thing but that will do what industry does the sub I do who you talkin sir I've done an analysis of the South African economy about 61% of the South African economy is at high risk of substantial digital disruption of the next few years another thirty percent is that risk at medium risk of substantial disruption so it applies to everybody point one point two it doesn't what I ",
        "5": "try to make sure I unpack is that it doesn't only apply to the people in IT or the executives in an organization everybody from your the head of your accounts receivable department to the sales manager of the case town branch needs to understand what it means for their area and what they can do to move forward in this field of digital one thing quite one thing is you said resonated you know we get it things are changing you know you go to a conference and and we hear that OH uber is the biggest taxi company and here be invisible ah yes we've heard that we get it things are changing what does this mean for me so how are you dressing that side of the conversation you've said you take it as a given so where are you going so the whole point is SS our try to create a structured model that is not just jumble of thoughts and ideas it's the case if people need to do something with it if they want takeaways well how do they apply it in their business on Monday you need a sort of a structured model and a way of thinking about it in an organized way that probes questions for people so what is what does this ",
        "6": "mean for my business what is this mean for my department and because it's only when you get down to that level in a structured way that actually gives them tips it's not a recipe for success let's be clear there's no recipe for success but it is a few tips and ways of thinking about it in a structured way asking the right questions for your business or your part of your business all right so we've been focusing quite heavily today and pushing quite heavily today this idea that a conference cannot be a data dump it cannot be a place to just come and hear speaker after speaker people delegates leaving a conference I've gotta go okay I can gain something right now I mean the biggest problem many have are things they spend an entire day like today at a conference and the fact is they can have gets back to the office on Monday with 180 emails demanding their attention so how do you translate all this information you heard into changing your situation right now so when you are presenting what are people taking away so we're not presenting what they're taking away is personally I mean the one thing I want them to take away is it's not primarily about the tech because if you think it's about the tech then it's somebody else's ",
        "7": "problem it's actually about our market it's about ways of doing business built on the tech so that's the first thing I want them to take away the second thing I want them to take away is this sort of list about so how do I win what are some of the things to consider in how to win and it's something that everybody has to take I think it is fair to say in a conference and you know so how do would mine fit in I think it's fair to say mine is more speaking to the head than the heart there's many of the other speakers you've heard today that speak to the heart which is very important in any in any conference mine is a little bit more about speaking to their head and giving people practical guidelines about what to do when they get back to the office all right well fantastic Brian and it is incredibly important I mean there's no doubt that we are at an amazing time in human history you know there's the potential is fantastic but the the potential pitfalls are also there we've got to understand where we're going so I think the role you play is incredibly important so and given your pedigree in your history in business it adds an incredible element of credibility to what you bring to this ",
