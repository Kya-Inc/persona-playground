        "0": "that are way above any any model scale that we have today but but above some certain capability threshold I think you should need to like go through a certification process for that I think there should be external Audits and safety tests we do this for like lots of other Industries where we care about safety Elon Musk has said you started open AI you both started open AI because he was scared of Google is Google still a threat Google is like unbelievably competent and it seems like they are focused with an intensity Google has not seen in a while on AI so they're still scary they're they are a company that I don't think anyone should ever write off now obviously we've seen all the barbs that you and Elon have been trading in public and in interviews right I don't really well you're responding you respond you get asked about it by people like me to be mostly people like you to be honest most other people ask about the technology but that is true why why do ",
        "1": "you think he's so frustrated or disappointed with the direction that openai has gone um I mean you should ask him he can give you a better answer then I can speculate so but I like I really am happy to talk about this this is the most important topic we can spend the rest of the time on it um I think he really cares about AI safety a lot and I think that's where it's coming from a good place and he just like you know we have differences in opinion on some parts but I think we both care about that and he wants to make sure we have like the we the world have the maximal chance at a good outcome so you're not worried he's gonna call you out how to call you to come to some cage match and they in the Vegas octagon I don't I don't know but I kind of I would go watch if he and Zach actually did that like all right well it's supposedly happening between him and Zach crazy I think those there will ",
        "2": "be quite an audience look you know there is much has been made of the Microsoft relationship and it's not just him but he has said he's worried that Microsoft has more control than the leadership at openai realizes and that they could cut you off at any time I mean I think what he means is that they could like break the contract and you know take away our access to the data center and a lot of money that you have access to right we have money it's the data center that like they operate for us I don't think that's a likely scenario for a bunch of reasons how would you characterize the relationship with micro soft we think it's great I mean like any deep complex relationship it's not without its challenges but it's really great it is by far the best major partnership I've ever been a part of um it's kind of like on both sides it was kind of a crazy thing to jump into and it's uh surprising that it works this well but if you just like look at the results for both companies ",
        "3": "we're very happy in 2018 that's the last time I believe we talked in person um you told me you thought AI would help us be our best but also stop our worst impulses what makes you confident about that because so many times time and time again it feels like technology has only Amplified our worst yeah and to be clear like it will do bad things too like I don't have this like only good view of it I'm I think realistic like other Technologies I think we we it's human nature to talk about the bad more than the good and I think we can look at other technologies that have done a lot of Good and Plenty of harm and talk 99 about the harm and one percent about the good and I do that too like I think that's understandable I think so in 2018 that was like way before the GPT series was kind of a thing you know so at that point we didn't we had some inkling it was going to go like this we ",
        "4": "certainly didn't know exactly but I think now what we're heading to is this like personal tool that can help you in whatever way you'd like and one of the fun parts of the trip was how diverse and Broad the stories are of how people are using it to be better at whatever they want to be better at and to help them with things they want to improve so you know like I think if you go talk to chat GPT users you'll find a lot of support for that comment from 2018 and you can also find people who are you know misusing it or unhappy with it the reality check though is that you're building this on the back of human debt is biased that is racist that is sexist that is emotional that is wrong like a lot of it is wrong how do you Safeguard against that there was a recent study that gpt4 the model that is released is like less biased on implicit bias tests than humans even who are humans who think they've really trained themselves to be good at this so I if you if you look at ",
        "5": "the model that comes out of the pre-training process that model will be quite biased and it'll reflect you know the internet but um reinforcement learning from Human feedback the tech one of the techniques we use to align the models Works quite well and you know if you look at the progress from model to model even like some of our biggest critics are like wow they've gotten quite a lot of the bias out of the model and so I think models like this can be a force for reducing bias in the world not for enhancing it now there's questions about what if a user like wants to use the model in a very biased way like how much control do you give a user who decides like what the limits of the value system are and you know that'll be a tough question for society to wrestle with it there's not like an obvious one sentence neatly buttoned up answer but the technology I think has gone much further than people thought it was going to in terms of being able to ",
        "6": "align these models to behave in certain ways um you and I have been talking going all the way back to your looped days yeah at YC and it's been fun to watch that Journey I think people really want to understand your incentives and don't necessarily under people are perplexed I've asked a lot of people what I should ask you okay they're perplexed that you have no equity can you explain that a little like is there any Financial structure whereby you do benefit if open AI is a big thing yeah I get why people are perplexed about this and I have like wondered if I should just like take one share of equities I never have to answer this question again um a few things one we have we're governed by a non-profit which I'm a board member and our board has needs to have a majority of disinterested directors um like who don't have equity in the company ",
        "7": "um so I originally didn't do it for that reason and then I was like you know I just I don't think about it but are there any Financial incentives like at a certain Benchmark no I mean I have a tiny bit of exposure view the YC investment but like it's immaterial so to be clear like if open AI you know is massively profitable you one of the takeaways I've learned from questions like this is that this like concept of having enough money yeah yeah is not something that is like easy to get across to other people it's hard for people to understand yeah but I like I have enough money I'm gonna make way way more from other Investments that I've made in the past like in some like if if I had just like taken the equity and signed the giving pledge people would be like that's great that makes sense and it would have had the same that I'm like pre-giving away the money here because it goes to the open AI nonprofit and I like trust the nonprofits do a good thing with it but ",
        "8": "like I have enough money what I want more of is like an interesting life impact like access to be in the room for a conversation so I still get like a lot of selfish benefit from this um like what else am I gonna do with my time uh this is like really great I cannot imagine a more interesting like life than this one and a more interesting thing to work on so I get like a ton of benefit but yes somehow this idea of like having enough money just doesn't compute for people so if it's not about money is it about power is it about control I want to like make my contribution back to you know human technological progress I get to benefit from all of this stuff that people did before like I get to use this iPhone that I still Marvel at every day all of the work that had to go into that in the human Tech Tree and those people I don't know who they are I'm very grateful to them um they knew they were like never going to get recognition from me personally but they also like wanted to do something to contribute and so do I and I like can't imagine better like ",
        "9": "compensation than that feeling um it would be like maybe weird if I had not already like made a bunch of money and again like plan to make way more from like other Investments but I just don't think about it yeah um I think this will be like I think this will be the most important step yet that Humanity has to get through with technology um and I really care about that what is one question that you really wish I want to learn about Elon and equity and you know like the personal drama of the day but seriously um I understand you are getting a lot of those questions no I'm happy to talk about it one question like I'm always excited to just talk about what can happen in the coming few years in a few decades with the technology so what are we all going to do when we ",
        "10": "have nothing to do uh I mean talk about Elon and Zucker no I don't I don't think we ever run out of things to do I think it's like deeply in our nature to want to create to want to be useful to want to like feel the Fulfillment of doing something that matters and if you talk to people from thousands of years ago hundreds of years ago even the work that we do now would have seemed you know unimaginable at best and probably like trivial this is like not directly necessary for our survival in the sense of like creating food or whatever and this shift happens with every technological Revolution every time we worry about what people are going to do on the other side and every time we find things and I suspect not only will this time not be an exception to that the things we find will be better and more ",
        "11": "interesting and more impactful than ever before like there are a lot of people that talk about AI as like the last techno technological Revolution I suspect it you know from the other side it'll look like the first like the other stuff will be so small in comparison I think the whole thing of like technological Evolutions is sort of dumb because my understanding has always been it's just one long continuous one but it is this continuing exponential and so what what will be enabled and the stuff we can't even imagine on the other side we will have way too much to do if you want if you want to just sit around do nothing that'll be fine too all right all right bon bons and beaches in my future if that's what you I don't think that's what you'll turn out to wonder but if you do great you talked about ai's designing other AIS on the tour can you play that out for us and occasions of that yeah I mean this is like the classic Sci-fi idea that you know at some point these systems can help progress themselves can discover better ",
        "12": "architectures can help write their own code uh you know I think we're a ways away from that but it is worth paying attention to yeah China and Russia you didn't go there on your trip I did speak I gave the keynote at the Chinese conference you did speak virtually yeah where do you think they are on AI and should we be worried I don't really know I'd love to have better information on that I don't I don't have a great sense does it concern you that we don't know yeah I mean again like any imperfect information always is a little concerning so I'd love to have a better sense but you know I'm I'm like optimistic that we can find some sort of collaborative thing and I think this I think this thing that often gets said in the U.S which is like it's impossible to cooperate with China it's just totally off the table is asserted as fact and like people are trying to will it into existence but it's like not clear to me it's true in fact I suspect it's not um well ",
        "13": "very hard right right right look I'm so grateful that you've been around the world talking about this I'm so grateful that you're with us today I think even you would acknowledge you have an incredible amount of power why should we trust you um you shouldn't like you know I don't as you you know me for a long time um public talk like I'd rather be in the office working I I but I think at this moment in time like people deserve basically as much time asking questions as they want and I'm trying to show up and do it but more to that uh like no one person should be trusted here I don't have super boating shares um like I don't want them the board can fire me I think that's important I think the board over time needs to get like democratized to all of humanity there's many ways that could be implemented um but the reason for our structure and the reason it's so weird and the one of ",
        "14": "the consequences of that weirdness was me ending up with no equity is we think this technology the benefits the access to it the governance of it belongs to humanity as a whole you should like not if this really works it's like quite a powerful technology and you should not trust one company and certainly not one person with it so why should we trust open AI are you saying we shouldn't no I think I think you should trust open AI but only if open AI is doing these sorts of things like if we're if we're you know years down the road and have not sort of figured out how to start democratizing control then I think you shouldn't but if this is like you know if we figure out some sort of new structure where openai is like governed by Humanity and that can happen in many ways including like the alignment data set we'd pick rather than us picking it we find a way to like and get it from Humanity as a whole um that could mean like actual board control there's many ways that could be implemented and we're talking to a lot of people about what that could look like but if we don't do that I don't I don't think like just trust us is good ",
        "15": "enough explaining why we should maybe consider trusting you um you have a plane to catch we're so great thank you very much for having me thank you so much for sure all right [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay now we are gonna follow that with the co-founders of inflection AI Reid Hoffman and Mustafa Suleiman as well as my colleague Brad Stone [Music] okay all right well Mustafa so let's read Hoffman thank you guys for joining us ",
        "16": "um Mustafa you are a co-founder of deepmind now division of Google you're the author of a forthcoming book The Coming wave read legendary venture capitalist uh your investor at early investor in open AI also an author of a book called impromptu the books are available for everyone thank you so thank you both which you wrote with AI right yes impromptu first book on AI co-written with an AI yes chat gpt4 will be doing a signing all you have to do is go to the web and and you're the co-founders of a company called inflection AI uh guys it's it's raining chat Bots these days uh from open AI well-funded startups all the big tech companies so tell us Mustafa maybe you start what is the the play here with inflection AI so I think this is unquestionably going to be the most radical transformation of our lifetimes I mean there are going to be AIS for all sorts of things for businesses for brands for digital influences our belief ",
        "17": "is that everyone is also going to have a personal AI one that is aligned to your interests on your team in your corner gets to know you and really forms a trusted relationship with you over time it'll be like a confidant uh conciliary there for you when you need to make tough decisions but also a chief of staff you know scheduling organizing prioritizing booking your AI is really going to be your digital representative you know negotiating on your behalf interacting with other sales AIS that are trying to you know I encourage you to buy something and helping you to you know get a great deal and like for example it's the whole set of things so like example one of the things I just found out yesterday is one of our team members at Greylock actually in fact is using pi for parenting advice oh cool right which is really awesome and that's the kind of thing you're like great or Reid why is this an opportunity for a startup isn't a Microsoft or a Google bar just a little closer to the customer ",
        "18": "and in a better position to offer that personal digital assistant well part of what's I mean you know obviously I I am on the board of Microsoft um and you know I was on the board of open Ai and part of the thing is what I love about startups is you have a unique Vision where you're unfettered by the other aspects of your business and you're building it so part of the idea that Mustafa the entire inflection team uh you know kind of came up with and you know I uh you know have a little bit of fingerprints here too is that IQ is not the only thing that matters here EQ matters as well and so how do you have this personal intelligence pie be helpful to you obviously very high-end you know IQ but also EQ and that was one of the reasons I used the parenting example because obviously there's a question of how you do it but it's also how you connect with people what what you do in order to amplify that and I think that's one of the things that um you know the inflection folks are doing better than everyone else so can we talk about the EQ thing because I was ",
        "19": "asking I asked hi what we should ask you it's questions were fine and then I was like are you gonna tell them that we had this conversation and it it responded haha I'm just a computer program I can't tell anyone anything but I assure you our conversations are confidential I do think it's pretty cool that we're having this meta conversation about your interview with my creators exclamation point and it was actually the personality that shocked me can you explain how you designed that I mean we've deliberately designed it to be patient curious kind one of the things that first struck us like a year and a half ago when we started working on this is like what makes for great conversation when do you feel that sense of flow and that sense of energy and connection with another another person and I think most of the time it's when you feel heard and understood you've received a little bit of affirmation but ",
        "20": "you know it's not completely sycophantic right it doesn't just agree with you at every moment it can be a little bit challenging it has boundaries so you can push it on certain topics and it'll take a position and that's really healthy but also it's just curious you know I mean I think many people are excited by the idea especially the users that we have of someone asking them lots of questions about the topic that they're interested in you know we don't always have someone in our Lives who is as knowledgeable and as passionate about our our favorite topics as we might like and so that's where Pi comes in because it's super knowledgeable and engaging so how does that make sense if you're also an investor in open AI well so it I think there's going to be a number of Agents I don't think there's going to be one agent to rule them all you know a a ring and Mordor uh but is Chachi BT going to rule most of us I mean no I don't think so I think that I mean it's partially it's it's it's like ",
        "21": "um same reason we talk to different people for different aspects of our lives right so you know this person we talked to about our our passion about snowboarding this person we talked to about what's going on in the country this person we talked to like we have a Pantheon same thing we'll have a Pantheon of of different kinds of of AI one will go um you know you ask chat gbt you know how do you uh you know Comfort a friend who's lost a treasured pet and it says here are five possible ways you might do that you asked pie and say oh that's that sounds like it's really hard for you and your friend you know your friend well what would count as being present there for your friend and it still has it has the IQ it has the five reasons but it goes through that style of going through it and I think these are different interaction experiences and the question is which one do you want this minute which one do you want more in your life you know that kind of thing and and part of the the the the design of pie is how do we help you be the best you right like it's it's it it and that doesn't mean by being sycophantic for ",
        "22": "example that's the question of you know like ask you questions about what do you think about this and and how do you go through it and help you navigate your life by being helpful in that way so Sam Altman was just on stage uh talking as he sometimes does about the theoretical dangers of AGI and and chat gpt9 and I'm just curious if you guys think generally that's a discussion worth having and where you each are on this spectrum of existential dangers from AI well let's start with the fact that one of the things that I think is a is is dangerous about the existential discussion is it it blinds us from some of the the nearer things which is uh ai's amplification intelligence as per the impromptu book and so it amplifies human beings and so we see a bunch of good things with human beings AI tutors AI doctors a bunch of other things there's also bad human beings and so what to do about bad human beings doing you know with AI is also part of the ",
        "23": "portfolio mix of how you shape this technology that's one of the reasons why mustafa's book The Coming wave I highly recommend um uh and I will hand the next part of the answer over to you and wait let me frame it though must happen Sam probably left the building by now you can say anything frankly like where do you kind of disagree with some of the alarmism notes that he has sounded look I I think it's easy to speculate around what a gpt9 might look like I mean you know six more orders of magnitude of compute would be eye-watering and I'm absolutely with those concerns around existential risk but if you play that out that is many many years and it is you know unclear what actually happens at that scale what's much more clear and what you know a lot of the themes I explore in the new book is that in the near term we're about to empower many many people if not ultimately everybody with access to the ability to amplify their existing power right this is not just a knowledge ",
        "24": "engine but in time it'll allow you to take actions right you'll be able to make recommendations buy things book things and that's going to get smaller and cheaper and therefore proliferate far and wide that is going to cause a dramatic instability and potentially a threat to the nation-state because anyone who has an agenda or is trying to sort of push a political outcome is suddenly going to see the barrier to entry to that kind of scaled impact lowered and so there's going to be a real question around how States kind of manage that distribution of power and I think there'll be a tendency to Lunge towards you know slightly more authoritarian more surveillance based mechanisms to prevent that proliferation which would both be bad for Innovation and obviously dystopian from a political governance perspective so hang on because and Sam and I were talking backstage as well and he's you know he's much more confident that AI will lead us to a more equal world than an unequal world are you saying that there's a ",
        "25": "better chance of economic dislocation and social dislocation as a result of this technology so both are likely to be true actually which is a little bit surprising but if you look back over the last 50 years the transistor the last wave which enabled the personal computer has clearly made us in many ways more equal whether you're a billionaire you earn twenty thousand dollars a year we all get access to the same Cutting Edge Hardware the smartphone and the laptop is broadly at The Cutting Edge and everyone else will catch up over the next five to ten years we're on the same trajectory with respect to access to intelligence and that is an unbelievable idea over the next decade hundreds of millions of people and then billions of people will get access to the same expert doctor the same expert educator the same tool for scheduling prioritizing organizing your life that is going to be the most meritocratic moment in the history of our species for ",
        "26": "sure it is a question around how individuals and groups and organizations use that power right because clearly we all have conflicting agendas and priorities and goals and that's basically where I think that we end up with significant disruption okay Reid but that's the class half full I mean what what is the Potential Threat to the millions of coders of customer service Representatives the job dislocation the people who are serving jobs whose functions can be easily replaced by AI your LinkedIn hat on um so the closest metaphor that I've come to you to describe this moment is it's a steam engine of the mind um if you look at this the former steam engine uh you know currency mentioned although obviously majorly Amplified Industrial Revolution gave us superpower of muscles super out of Transport superpower of construction all these things now we're gonna have superpowers of the mind now there's a whole bunch of of a very positive things that come out ",
        "27": "of that I mean all of the things we have come of of of of of of the increase in wealth that allows medicine general education everything else comes out of the Industrial Revolution I think the same thing will be coming out of the steam engine the mind now the but the transition is going to be difficult um the transition is going to be okay well uh customer service jobs is going to change a whole lot now Engineers I think you know look you if you roughly kind of go through a company and you go we 10x each function you say you 10x sales people great so want to hire more sales people ourselves the 10x marketing people it's like okay maybe the marketing function will change some so less order entry more thinking about it but you're still in a business competitive ecosystem you don't want to stop marketing or or not be be doing it when you get to customer service you get more replacement but here is part of the thing that I part of the reason why I did the book impromptu and I'm trying to orient people is like okay so customer service people there's going to be a transition well AI can help with that you can build AIS that help figure out ",
        "28": "other kinds of working jobs that can help you find them that can help you learn them that can help you do them and so that's the thing that we as a society need to be doing so it's like less like how do we slow down AI how do we shape it to help the broad swath of humanity in this transition that's where I'm trying to get the dialogue and discussion to Mustafa um we were just talking to Sam about uh Google and whether or not it's still scary and he's like yeah they're still formidable um you quit deepmind and Google AI and obviously a lot of people have have have left Google is there something wrong at Google or some sort of innovator's dilemma there that will prevent it from truly succeeding on generative AI because it undermines its own business model look fundamentally AI stands in tension with Google's existing business model it's very hard to eat yourself from within and adapt and respond to the coming wave so for a while Google was ",
        "29": "just idling you know I was there on Lambda we had chat gbt before chat gbt it was just like a remarkable feeling internally playing with this incredible tool and not really being able to get it out into products it took you know the launch of chat TPT to kind of threaten Google and really shake everything up and you know Google's a very formidable and you know you know organization full of super smart people so I'm I I'm sure they'll be just fine but I can understand why they're stuck because nobody wants a personal AI in your pocket that is actually funded by ads right you don't you don't want a Salesman in your pocket that is trying to persuade you to go and buy more or do XYZ you need fiduciary alignment right your AI has to be on your team and that means ultimately you have to pay for it and if somebody else is paying for it you have to ask yourself what are they trying to persuade you of are they trying to influence you in some way and I think people are alive to that now and ",
        "30": "that's a real challenge for Google because it's very unclear how they're going to manage this transition so we asked Sam if Google scares him does open AI scare you Mustafa first menu no no it definitely doesn't I mean actually this morning uh We've announced our new large language model called inflection one and we set out to build a model that was fast enough and more capable than every other model on the market for our compute class so we're very proud that you know a year on from our launch we're now better than llama Chachi PT Palm 540 chinchilla all of the other models of our size and that's super important because it Powers pi and ultimately it will be available as a conversational API so you can obviously play with it at Pi dot AI now and you know I think that demonstrates that with a team of 35 people uh you know in a pretty short order we're able to exceed The Cutting ",
        "31": "Edge and now build an absolute best-in-class AI which is very exciting and obviously we've also managed to do that because we've been able to gather a huge amount of capital and some great investors and train in fact what we now have is the largest operational cluster in the world of h100s nvidia's latest chip and that's a huge Advantage okay and and one of the things because I I was listening to your conversation with Sam and you know it's obviously an awkward question when you ask him it's like well should we trust you because it's like yes trust me it's like well that's weird because if someone says I said no you shouldn't yes someone says yes trust me you're like well wait a minute but look I uh the open AI people are really great people I think it's it's governed by a 501c3 there's frequently a bunch of fud uh Social Media stuff that that that that that that that that kind of obscures that um I you know had spent a number of years on the board and in in in team I still work with them and help them they are fully paying attention to every ",
        "32": "serious question I mean like for example there Sam went and spent a month it's crazy you're doing a startup it's in a month doing a world tour talking to people say look I'm here you can talk to me about your concerns I want to make sure it's good for Humanity I don't just care about this kind of U.S San Francisco Tech scene I care about what its impact on humanity is and so I have come here to talk to you so that kind of like I'm engaging conversation I care about this is the kind of Reason in addition to a 51c3 emission structure and everything else and so no I'm I'm delighted with it I don't see how he's getting any work done but I want to change gears quickly we're going to throw some Twitter polls up on the screen today and we asked Twitter users where the greatest advancements in AI would come from we'll see the results but I want to ask about maybe returning with you our the U.S China policy of divestment is can can we reasonably hope that you know doing that will maybe prolong America's advantage in AI is it is it a smart strategy I don't think ",
        "33": "divestment is a smart strategy I think staying connected is better for both the US and China and the world I think competition is very good I think the fact that there's various ways that we in the US and the West Coast have a AI lead I think that's a great thing for kind of the values the ecosystem the kind of the great world order that the US should be very proud of in the last 70 years of that like there's lots of things to be critical of two of course but like as a really peaceful time trying to make it business and interconnection is a really good thing and I I'm a very strong uh believer and proponent of that but I think it divestment's not the not the animal it's half of you write in the book that China has an explicit National strategy to be the AI Leader by 2030. so do you agree with read that withdrawal divestment is a is a smart strategy I mean China is already ahead of its own schedule I mean it's publishing significantly more papers on AI than we are collectively in ",

        "126": "great great hi I'm James Chan partner at Bloomberg beta and I'm pleased to be joined by Lauren Miss Kelly managing director and GTM lead of Chrome browser Enterprise for Chrome Enterprises sponsor Spotlight the future of the web how Chrome Enterprise is shaping the way we work welcome Lauren uh so to start can you give a quick overview of yourself and what you do at Google sure thanks for having me so I'm Lauren muskelly I lead our go to market team for Chrome Enterprise at Google and what that means is we focus on bringing the browser to people at work and my team works every day with customers to make sure that their experience in the browser at work is the best possible and then how is the role of the browser evolving Within the Enterprise today yeah so cyber security threats have ",
        "127": "become much more sophisticated over the years and security has always been core to Google's approach to Computing and it underpins all of the technology choices we make every day within Chrome computing's also evolving with more and more of our work and lives online in the cloud and online in the cloud every day so because of that corporate data uh you know our customers are more and more asking how to protect corporate data online so we're seeing that uh be prevalent in all of our conversations with customers so securing that data becomes really important and you need to secure that both at rest in transit and where our users are which is in the browser so we approach that in two ways from a chrome perspective the first is protecting the user and protecting them in the browser itself and then secondly offering more ",
        "128": "controls and management of that through Chrome Enterprise okay so that's terrifying and kind of scary we should maybe talk about the fun stuff okay so future browsing in the Enterprise yeah so like I mentioned we're seeing more and more work uh happening in the browser and we'll continue to see that trend for sure uh I think it'll be easier for people to do work uh ever that more than ever before and the browser will be smarter so you'll be able to pick up where you left off so less time trying to remember where where you were probably that shortcut you told me about before what is it command shift a which is the best shortcut for Chrome ever everyone should try it plug there and I think there'll be more separation between your personal browser and your work browser we'll also see and I think people have heard a lot of this today AI ",
        "129": "coming more and more to the Forefront both to help folks stay productive and from a security perspective so from a productivity perspective just making your life easy easier in the browser making you work smarter not harder and then from a security perspective we've been building security Ai and ml into the browser for years and we'll just continue to build upon that finally and we'll see it and security teams be able to more easily manage the browser and have more granular controls which should free up time for them to work on more strategic initiatives and less time updating the browser and then there are there other angles around a Ai and ml that are interesting definitely so like I mentioned we've been using Ai and ml for years from a security standpoint so for example safe browsing uh within Chrome it protects billions of ",
        "130": "users every day and it does so through constant crawling of uh the internet to look for malicious sites files downloads to protect users so that's one specific example with security the next is Chrome Journeys so I don't know if you've used that feature but it helps users take complex information and tasks and clusters the browsing activity to make it helpful on the next steps so for example I was researching and doing an event with my team and wanting to do some team building exercises both virtual in person did a lot of searching across that and then got distracted started doing something else and I was able to go back to Chrome and predict it predicted for me that workflow of saying here's all the things you're searching on and you probably want to go back to that but also here's some also similar sites that might help you complete this ",
        "131": "task so that's from that perspective and we'll also see generative AI play a bigger and bigger role especially when it comes to for work and being helpful for the employee to from a search standpoint so when you think about that from search it's really about looking for a specific result and helping an employee find that answer faster and then get that information quicker so that would mean having a more personalized panel to say here's what you were looking for let me consolidate that information and make it easier for you to understand so that's you know just a way for a worker to get to that information more quickly so I think we'll see that and then additionally you'll see more and more uh Ai and ml built into Chrome and other Google products to come and I feel like sort of at Google you're consistently living in the future right and then sort of like in that next version of work that we're ",
        "132": "going to be living in yeah what are the sort of features that are going to be important for us yeah I think we'll definitely I mean expand on all the features we have now so I think a lot of them are future looking already but expand on them now and continue to make them better and then obviously build new features uh to come whether it's capabilities I'd say to make it easier for you to get around the web and just make that whole experience and journey easier I think it will surface you know what you'll need at your next job to get that done more easily I think you'll get users to where they need to go faster through better URL filtering so that you get there more quickly and then I would say like a seamless experience working across devices and potentially making passwords a thing of the past that would be shocking right without the that'd be great make people's lives easier for sure okay so finally what's the your favorite feature that you're working on yeah so I think I'll say two-fold uh since we have a little time ",
        "133": "so in the professional realm I would say what I really like is I work now and I'm sure a lot of you here across many devices so being able to pick up where I left off so if I have a set of tabs that I was using my Chromebook at home on the couch or in the office and then I moved to my mobile device opening those same tabs that I was using and then maybe going to my other device that I have sitting at my desk at home being able to seamlessly move between those is something that's really easy and then on a personal side as a parent of two very busy children autofill saves my life on a daily basis so I don't know if anyone else has to fill out a lot of forms constantly form after form being able to not have to write date of birth all of the things for every one of us my email address five million times I think that from a just pure productivity standpoint lets me do more work at work and get all ",

        "135": "first live interview with Dan Clancy uh CEO of twitch who goes live very often on his twitch but here's speaking to you after his big promotion so tell me first how has that transition been you've president for a while now you're running the thing what's different about that so um and first of all it's great to be here Sarah it's fun to be here and and as you said it is um uh you know one thing I do is live stream now and now I have people out here and so it's great um so the one thing I've I've said a few times that I find kind of funny is before my job was president and much of the company I was responsible for it so many of the decisions were the same but um there really is a very visceral difference between feeling that responsibility as CEO um our platform we have over seven million streamers that depend upon us stream every month and I feel this kind ",
        "136": "of um uh you know realization that ultimately in terms of my job they depend upon me and how I do my job um and so but it's been really fun and tell me how um how strongly you you got that feedback when you became CEO was it was just after this change in terms of how twitch was thinking about Revenue split with the creators it was a big blowback we're seeing a lot of tension right now between social media platforms and their their users um yeah so you're in the thick of it what's that like so we're in the thick of it and part of it is our we matter a lot to our creators I think twitch is very unique um I think we're different than many of the other players and for many of our creators we're a big part of their lives um you know they're living a life that they never thought they could have left right and I I go out and talk to them and they go yeah I never thought this could be my life they're making a living streaming themselves playing video games ",
        "137": "and doing other stuff and they're like who'd have thought um this could have been and so it matters to them and so then they keep a very close eye on us and I thank their their response is actually an expression of how much we matter to them but you did have to make some changes um based on that response like how do you navigate because you're you're CEO of twitch but you answered Amazon and how do you navigate continuing to grow this community continuing to have that kind of like you know past profitability it might crack that twitch is not yet profitable we we don't we don't talk about that but answer here good try though Sarah a decade past that about since the acquisition by Amazon I mean you must be feeling some pressure on that end too and how do you balance yeah the two so so the way I think of ",
        "138": "this is um uh uh we do have a responsibility to our creators to make sure we're here for a very long time and so yes the way I describe it is we need to make sure we're a sustainable business um and that is serving what we're trying to do with them and so um I think anyone who's been in a um any position you're always balancing things the hard decisions are never the ones that are obvious the hard decisions are when you're weighing a bunch of different things and you have to figure out a path some other hard decisions that we've seen leaders of social media platforms make recently I mean there was the backlash over changes at Reddit that cause a strike by several communities there's been a lot of uproar about changes at Twitter since Elon Musk took over um Instagram's algorithm isn't isn't it has been changing that has been changing pivoting more to video and entertainment than update some friends and family um what what have you learned from looking at that ",
        "139": "um the difference in those communities and how they've grown and how does it make you want to grow so I think each of those each of those communities are are different um uh I think I think everyone here knows what it's like to live in a social media world where there's a um uh there's always very vocal critics of almost anything so part of what you need to do is like understand a North star of where you're going and um for us our North Star is thinking about um the streamers that come on our platform in terms of we use this phrase feign money and love because we've used that since the founding we're really a big part of what happens on Twitch is they build communities and and then from that Community they can um you know make money and and sustain themselves and so I think you just go back to your mission and then you just realize if you stay true to that then you keep pushing then I think you get there but this ",
        "140": "you also need to to run a business um and you're saying running a business is also good for them how do you how do you commune in one way I think that you do this is by using the platform yourself and seeing how it works how do you build that rapport with the users and I mean let's get them to trust right now you're taking this in the right direction I mean for us trust is a big deal and I think in fact that's one of the things that I'm mostly focused on I don't think um people trust people they don't necessarily always trust companies I think that's naturally the way we are um we depend upon our streamers so I've been I'm spending a lot of time going on in fact last night I was in LA in a uh dinner we had with about 40 of our strongest streamers I'm going to Denver next week where I'm spending time with them so I've really been doing two things one is going around and physically spending time with them because it's that direct connection where you can hear from them and then the other thing as you said is using the product so ",
        "141": "um you know I started streaming every week and it's a small stream and so it's really neat because a lot of um a lot of people come up on the stream and then I let them come up on my stream we have a new feature guest star where I can bring audience members up and they just and many times there's some small streamers I play the piano and sing and I play the piano and sing and then I also talk to them and I talk to them about their experiences on Twitch and they just love the fact that they're coming up on the CEOs of twitch stream and that I'm interacting them and they all have small communities I haven't like promoted this it's you know um you know I'll have 100 150 people at any point in time 1500 people in a night um and I think that really gives you a very first-hand visceral feeling for what so many of our streamers because we have really big streamers with so many of our streamers are there streaming to 50 100 200 people at any point in time I mean speaking of the the visceral feeling of of being a streamer you know ",
        "142": "there there are the audience pressures that they're getting there's the the hate they may be getting are you are you thinking about like now that you've been doing it ways to make twitch a better Community from that perspective like yeah the you know from a Content moderation perspective but what it what are you working on there I think one of twitches and for those who haven't uh for those who haven't used twitch I'm going to bet there are a number of people in this audience that haven't used twitch um a big part of the magic um is the fact that it's not just about sitting and watching somebody it's about the community and the chat and the interaction and the way I often describe it um I'll go back to an old sitcom is um uh cheers used to have this phrase a bar where everybody knows your name well when people come to Twitch they're a member of eight nine ten communities where everybody knows their name and they show up and they say ah I've been a vixen Where Have You Been um but a huge part of that is feeling safe when you're in that Community because as we know in the social media ",
        "143": "World there are always people that are out there that are going to start jumping in and you know saying all sorts of things so we spent a ton of time first of all building moderation tools to help our creators and then we also have moderators that are dedicated members of the community that go ahead and control and manage what's set so that's something that happens on my stream it happens on every stream and we're continually looking for ways so that way you can clean up because nobody wants to be there if it's getting how does over content moderate has it gotten to the point where you can understand when somebody's being awful on the internet yeah so so um we use AI to help us with what our system called Auto mod I think that's one of our strengths um I think actually it's still a testament of how for all that aai has done how there's still work to do because it can detect a fair amount of ",
        "144": "stuff but there's a lot of subtle stuff that humans detect that AI doesn't so we actually use a combination where we use Ai and automated techniques but then we'll use humans because it's really a combination I mean you know we certainly are continuing to best because I think over time AI you know get better and better at understanding context and understanding nuances because right now it's more it's more supplementary you still have to have people who know you'll still I was streaming I was streaming and um uh somebody said uh something um uh I love the way you finger the keys and they are honestly talking about me playing piano okay but the AI said oh this is a little suspect right and of course it was completely okay um uh and the moderator looked at it and passed it through but it popped up like on mine to say is that okay right and so it's just an example that they're just like these very subtle nuances right that as humans we're able to look ",
        "145": "at something and realize it right away so in your world you're watching people build communities through their creativity through their expression we just had a panel about how AI is is transforming art how it's changing what um what kind of content we will likely consume in the future how are you seeing AI change what gets streamed and can it ever be a part of that Community aspect of twitch yeah so most y'all probably aren't aware of this there's this very interesting live channel that popped up called Never forever which was um an animated never-ending Seinfeld episode where they trained it on Seinfeld and they had these characters that were telling jokes in Seinfeld um and it was it was quite entertaining now the interesting thing was they eventually violated our community guidelines because that's just the nature of it right and so we had to figure out well how do you deal with that um but while it was really cool and neat it's not what makes twitch magical ",
        "146": "because it's the emotional connection with the streamer so there are all sorts of things that there's some um uh generative AI where people are doing interviews when they acknowledge that this is really you know an artificial interview that I think is creative but I think the foundation is still the human connection and I know um Jason's coming up next and we're talking about with Discord the interesting thing is twitch and Discord both these Testaments of in the end as human beings what we are designed to do is create human connection that is what we evolved to do that is what happens on Twitch that is what happens on Discord and um I don't think it is the same in terms of AI in the middle of that so I think the foundation of twitch is still always going to be out human connection give us a sense of of how strong that connection can get you know give an example of some of your some of your biggest streamers and you know how much are they making how much are they um building on Twitch yeah so so I think ",
        "147": "um uh really what happens on Twitch is they're all sizes of streamers okay so there are some streamers that will have you know uh 20 or 25 000 so if you take Hassan ABI you know he'll get a large audience and it's a very different experience when you go there and you watch it's chat it's just flying by because you know sometimes we talk about it as a stadium experience but then you have all these creators that then maybe have 500 or 600 at any point in time okay or 100 or 200 and so I think you see the gamut but I think the for me the magic of twitch are all the um smaller communities we see this in our monetization where in terms of a big part of our monetization is direct support from the community um and you see how they're much more efficient when they're a smaller Community because you have that emotional connection and so in fact for you know per person that's watching it's much more efficient because of that so I think really the magic of the fact it's not about being a big streamer it's about it's about the whole thing the ",
        "148": "people who are obsessed with what you're doing and it may be that there may be one big streamer that everyone watch but anyone who uses twitch also watches a lot of medium and smaller streamers what um oh we have a question from the audience um how are you seeing creators adopt gen AI you talked about the Seinfeld episode example but are they incorporating it into their their streaming work yeah I think I think that is the way you know um uh I I use the concrete example where somebody was doing these synthetic interviews right and now they acknowledge they were synthetic interviews um but it was using generative Ai and they were interviewing other twitch streamers hypothetically right and so I think it is kind of interesting from a creative perspective how um it can enhance the creative expression of our creators we don't have a lot of time left so I want to talk to you about about growth like how how does twitch grow from here because I was looking at the numbers and it looked like you guys had a really great amount ",
        "149": "of interest during the pandemic when everyone was home and on their computers um without other ways to interact socially but now it's sort of plateaued how do you reinvigorate that um that growth do you need to expand Beyond gaming do you need to build more of those small communities that you were talking about yeah so um uh during coven one of the things to me it demonstrated that we there are still all sorts of people we hadn't reached yet because there are all these people that had some extra free time and they use twitch and now we did come back a little bit still many of those people are still using twitch they hadn't experienced twitch and part of it is when you experienced twitch it starts with you getting attached to one Creator okay the stars are the creators not the platform okay so um we absolutely you talked about going outside of gaming the way I describe our platform is we've always been a talk platform it just so happened that people have been gaming while they talk okay and now ",
        "150": "about 30 percent of our hours watch come from people that aren't gaming while they talk okay and we're investing in other ways that people can come on build communities I'm the quintessential example of that right um because that need for connection is a human need it's not a gaming need gaming does work really well for live streaming okay but I think ultimately our growth is is foundation on finding how can we unlock more creators and more streamers so today we have seven million people who might stream uh uh in a month how do we turn that to 20 million because that's the foundation of um of drives our success in setting that example as the CEO helps move the needle in your mind well well actually it doesn't necessarily move that needle right what it does is gives me a very visceral feeling for what they're experiencing so that is I'm making decisions as I'm engaging and it also makes them trust me because they see me out there experiencing them when I go talk to them I can talk about their ",
