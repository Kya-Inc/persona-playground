        "1": "tick in regulation right after just like the lines have been going down for a while right but it does prompt these big questions about should The Regulators have been more proactive should they have been doing things before people lost money and then what should they do now anyway we have the perfect guest to talk about this because we are going to be speaking with Brian Armstrong CEO and co-founder of coinbase uh right in the middle of all this the preeminent American crypto exchange so Brian thank you so much for coming on odd Lots yeah thanks for having me I want you a question we've actually actually other exact crypto space this question before but I'd love to get your take on it um what is yield farming and where does the return of it come from well I mean yield farming has a little bit of a bad name I think in this environment um there was obviously with the collapse of you know Terra Luna and blockfi and some other firms like that I think that's a very valid question to be ",
        "2": "asking and I'm not sure I can even answer it on the on their behalf um but you know I think there's a lot of other pieces of crypto that people are still excited about and um you know there's lots of things we can build beyond that so one of the things we've talked about on the show quite a bit is this idea of crypto as kind of the ultimate momentum asset and when money is flowing in prices go up and everything is great when money flows out prices collapse quite quickly which would seem to make the business of being a crypto exchange extremely cyclical but one of the things that stood out from your most recent results um you just reported relatively recently you talked about how you want to be profitable through the cycle through the upturns and the downturns can you talk a little bit more about how you plan on doing that yeah well historically most of our Revenue has been from Trading fees which are absolutely right it is cyclical and crypto has been a fairly volatile asset class um and goes up and down now what we've done is we've started shifting more and more of our Revenue to what we call ",
        "3": "subscription and services in our financials and our earnings calls and basically what that means is things like USD coin a stablecoin that's been a nice growth mechanism for us even in a down crypto Market things like custody fees um fees that we earn on coinbase card people are you know using it for spending and Merchant Merchant Commerce activity so these things are I wouldn't say there's zero percent correlated with overall market and crypto but they're certainly a lot less than trading fees and that's allowing us to build a more predictable business so we started in the industry also talk about the regulatory side and I want to um you know we'll definitely talk a lot about that but in particular I think yesterday I saw that coinbase uh you had some new program I think was called the 435 program about you know call your Congressman like let people know that you care about uh crypto policy and of course like uber sort of famously started the strategy like telling people on the app like tell your local Regulators you want to drive an Uber and ",
        "4": "I I'm going to try to ask this in the most like diplomatic way possible and I have many friends who are into crypto and I like many of them but when it comes to crypto do you want the type the type of person who would call their Congressman to tell them to do better crypto policy is that really the type of person that you want sort of being the voice of crypto regulation well I think the average person in crypto and by the way there's a lot of them you know one true one in five households now have used crypto about 50 million Americans This is a this is becoming a major constituent of you know lobbying group and everything that's gonna have shape future elections they wanna you know these average people they may not have the exact uh solution for what the legislation should say around regulation of crypto but they do know that they want elected representatives who are going to ensure that this industry comes within the regulatory perimeter offers consumer protection but also you know allows this Innovation to flourish so that it can we can update the financial system you know 80 of ",
        "5": "Americans now uh believe that the financial system doesn't work for them it's either too slow it has too high of fees um it doesn't you know nobody has equal access or not everyone has equal access to it and it's not surprising that's the case I mean the technology behind the financial system is sometimes 40 years old it's you know written in Cobalt and these mainframe computers and the laws for it are sometimes 100 years old they were created before the internet even existed right so it's time to update the financial system we I think the average voter in America is now realizing that crypto is one of the great technologies that can help you update that and they want their elected representatives to bring that that legislation and Clarity to the U.S just on the political side I mean Joe and I kind of alluded to this in the intro this idea that now that we have losses and we have big scandals in the industry Regulators seem to be becoming more active in the space can you talk to us a little bit about from your perspective what is it like dealing with Washington now versus say in 2020 or 2021 yeah ",
        "6": "well I would say compared to 2020 um many more people that I meet with in Washington are actually pretty knowledgeable about crypto now um it's no longer a niche thing some of the conversations I had five years ago you know they were very basic um but most people that I speak with now actually have a reasonable understanding of crypto um they there's I think there's two camps one Camp is saying hey in the wake of FTX I'm afraid of being associated with crypto and I'm just going to kind of wait and see what happens because it's too dicey to even go near it the other half of the folks that I speak with are saying you know what this is an opportunity I'm actually I want to be the one of the people who helps bring this within the regulatory perimeter and and we can see how important that is now with the collapse of FTX and so they're actually drafting legislation they're trying to gather bipartisan support to get some clarity going and you know I'm personally much more in favor of that latter group so actually I wanna you know you talk about this impulse it's like okay in the wake of ",
        "7": "FTX bring it inside the regulatory perimeter and part of my question is like why because I look at FTX collapsing one of the biggest like sort of like crucial exchanges in the industry and nothing bad happened after that there was no Fallout or no bailouts it didn't have any spillover so part of my figure is like I don't want this in any perimeter because that seems to work pretty well in terms of the lessons of 2008 avoiding too big to fail what about the argument that it's like from a sort of like structural like yeah like Financial contagion standpoint Regulators have done a pretty good what a pretty good job not letting this volatile product this volatile industry create problems for the financial system the Let It Burn strategy yeah well you know I would disagree with the idea that nothing bad happened I mean a lot of people lost money absolutely and and I'm glad you said that because I did not you're right people lost their like yes yeah so there were certainly some bad ",
        "8": "activity there and I think that's the kind of uh consumer protection we're talking about I don't I don't think there should have been bailouts or anything like that nothing um in crypto is too big to fail and it's kind of antithetical to crypto frankly to you know have a bailout something like that if you the first Bitcoin block that was mined right had a message in it about um that you know Chancellor on the brink of bailout so crypto was kind of founded almost Bitcoin was founded as a result of a reaction to the 2008 financial crisis but I think those two ideas can come into Unity I mean we can have and again I'm talking about for the centralized actors in crypto you know the custodians exchanges companies like coinbase it's pretty clear everybody generally there's broad consensus those should be regulated apply some of the best practices and standards so we don't have fraud and Corruption and things you know wash trading or AML issues but the decentralized pieces of crypto that's different I mean we need to have decentralized uh protocols so that we can have a global more Global and fair and free financial system and that piece you know I don't think those are going to be regulated because there is no Central Authority for Bitcoin or ",
        "9": "ethereum for instance what should consumer protections look like in crypto in your opinion and especially you know when I think of something like Dogecoin you know it's hard for me to come up with an economical use case for it and so it's like well you can put all the disclosures that you want on there but it seems highly likely that people will be losing money on that product at some point in time yeah so again I would say you know the regulation and consumer protection probably should happen with the centralized actors the custodian The Exchange The Exchange not necessarily Dogecoin which would be another decentralized coin right um but yeah I mean I think the the exchanges and the firms that are being built around you know custody or trading of things like that they are going to have to have um some of these best practices from the traditional Financial Services world so you know let's have audited Financial let's make sure customer funds are segregated from uh corporate funds um let's make sure that there's AML kyc programs and avoid avoiding wash trading and um yeah appropriate disclosures are important as well so those are all just ",
        "10": "kind of good General best best practices but again it's focused on the centralized players as opposed to the decentralized pieces it's interesting uh you make this distinction obviously between you know there's sort of centralized players and then decentralized D5 stuff you're kind of becoming a hybrid and you recently launched a layer to roll up to help scale ethereum and I'm curious as a regulated entity and one that has to abide by like fin sand and anti-monitoring money laundering laws can you explain if the tension or is there any tension between I believe these sort of like uh you know roll-up layer twos have some sort of centralized sequencer so that the transactions made out of them then get batched to the main ethereum chain are you responsible for that and do you hate how do you deal with that as an regulated entity what if someone wanted to or tried to launder money through this layer two are you uh facilitating that by putting those transactions onto the main ethereum ",
        "11": "chain yeah so earlier you know I mentioned that the centralized players like coinbase should be regulated and I and I was really referring to like you know our primary revenue stream today which is custodian exchange but you're absolutely right we are embracing decentralization at coinbase we have a number of different products and legal entities and different ones working in various areas so we did launch this really exciting thing a layer two solution called base and our goal with that is really to help um provide more scalability and better usability for Layer Two Solutions so we want to get transactions in ethereum down to you know a penny or less and help that scale to hopefully a billion or more people someday um now I think I guess the core of your question was really around um the responsibility from a centralized decentralized and I think you know so basis is uh it has some centralized components today but it's it's going to be more and more decentralized over time as as it grows and so um you know I think we have responsibility in terms of you know transaction monitoring things like that that we have to look at in the early days but as it decentralizes I think that again the centralized actors are ",
        "12": "the ones that are probably going to have the most responsibility there to avoid money on money laundering issues and and having transaction monitoring programs things like that So speaking of responsibility um you know there are thousands I think of coins and tokens listed on on coinbase now um more like hundreds hundreds okay 250. I didn't flip through all the pages but there's a lot um and you guys say that you never actually list Securities but it feels like nowadays there's so much uncertainty over you know you could wake up tomorrow and the SEC says this is a security or that's a security I mean just a little while ago for instance they were um I think there was an enforcement action on Kim Kardashian for unlawfully touting a crypto security so how how can you say with confidence that you don't list any Securities when it feels like that's a very fluid thing at the moment yeah so I ",
        "13": "think look the best thing for for us and for the whole industry would be here's a clear rule book everybody has to follow it you know and if the rules change give us a new rule book we'll follow that one right we've actually been requesting that and we've we filed a petition with the SEC on this people can read it on their website and we sort of enumerated look these are the ways that the current Securities laws don't really address some of these underlying questions in crypto um like if there is no common Enterprise or centralized entity behind this thing who who publishes the disclosures you know um so there's there's questions like that now what we've done in the absence of that Clarity which again would be the best case scenario is that we have created our own internal process to review assets and um we developed something I think it has like 72 72 points in the legal analysis and kind of one area it looks at is Securities Law it also looks at compliance risk you know cyber security risk things like that and we've evaluated probably roughly a thousand assets through this process about 800 of them we have rejected and for various ",
        "14": "reasons whether Securities or compliance or cyber about you know 200 250 or something like that we've decided to list so you know I I guess the heart of your question is is what happens if the SEC comes out and says okay so if they come out and they and they again we're asking we're asking for more clear rules right right so if they come out and say um you know we think this asset is a security that's great okay now we have Clarity and assuming you know it's not if it meets the legal definition it's not going too far we would be happy to sort of update our process and our system based on that that new information now ultimately um if if they publish something and they say well we think all these assets are securities well that's not really our understanding of the law and of the third parties and external Council we've worked with and so there is a line here where I think as an industry and it's not just us it's these asset issuers which are even more primarily affected you know they would have to say okay well let's let a Court decide that because you know we have to follow rule of law so does the SEC right and so if ",
        "15": "they put out um you know their opinion about something that doesn't necessarily mean it's true it just means the court ultimately has to be the decider on that can you give an example not necessarily of a specific coin but of something that you have seen in tokens that you've rejected that to your mind says Nope we cannot list this because this is a characteristic of a security yeah I mean um there's so there's a variety I mean there's many prongs of the Howie test right I mean um and I don't want to get into like an in-depth legal analysis here but you know we've never done a Howie Test episode so this could be it but no go ahead yeah um so you know there's multiple prongs there right I think you know if if people are buying it primarily with this expectation of profit and it there's you know there's a common Enterprise and and and right so but is there something in the like speaking in terms of patterns that you see within crypto projects that when you look at it's like no this team ",
        "16": "like the type of things the teams do they would say you know what this token is not going to be kosher for coinbase are there things that you see in the industry where you think teams are crossing that line into I don't know whether it's the common Enterprise aspect that just uh preclude them from at least your judgment uh being safe to list yeah I mean so I'll give you a security example but there's others out in cyber security and others um so you know look if you're if you're legitimately just trying to raise money for your company or for some project like an apartment complex or something like that that is a security that's the point of Securities Law there has to be an investment of of money in into this thing and for you know in a common Enterprise has been expectational profit you know based on the effort of others so that should Exist by the way and we want that to exist in the world um we've acquired a broker to your license uh we're just dormant right now we'd like to activate it we're working with the SEC to hopefully make that happen crypto is a technology that could make you know crypto Securities could offer benefits ",
        "17": "and and update the financial system and improve all kinds of things T you know time to settlement and various things like that so that's an example um you know if people are out there kind of really hyping these things like on YouTube and um and the tokenomics are look sketchy and um you know there's really low float and the Insiders are selling these are all bad fact patterns and we those are things we try to avoid for Consumer Protection um you know there's other ways there's other reasons we may reject assets too I mean an initial another example would be cyber security risk so we often will um evaluate the smart contracts for you know is there some exploit in this or there's an ability you know if if the if the asset issuer is not even like in a malicious thing but an accident thing if they lose the key um everyone's funds could be swept or something like that that's not secure enough right to meet our standards so those are examples is crypto shooting itself in the foot in some respects by like resisting the security designation like is that a tacit admission that maybe there isn't a ",
        "18": "reasonable expectation of profits here yeah yeah um I mean we want actually crypto Securities to exist so we're not saying none of these things are securities but on the flip side is not true either it's not that all of these are securities both of those are inaccurate um statements and I guess the thing I would say too is that um just an expectation of profit alone does not make something a security it has to be meet every prong of the Howie test is my understanding so an example you know people might buy a Picasso painting hoping it goes up in value or by by gold or something like that so those aren't Securities um so yeah I mean basically Bitcoin ethereum and the assets that we trade on our platform today we believe are crypto Commodities and and it's you know people trade those some of them they want to go up in value just like they buy gold um other other times they're using it for various utility aspects you know this is sort of I want to get back to the regulatory question but before I forget can you talk for a second about ",
        "19": "how you view Bitcoin specifically because it feels like the crypto industry in many respects has moved on from Bitcoin and I'm sure your mentions on Twitter are filled every day with angry laser eyes people that think you hate Bitcoin but it is also true that you know you launched you launched an ethereum Layer Two I don't know if do you have a lot do you is there a coinbase Lightning node or uh we'd like to do more with lightning sure I'm Calvin Pro lightning so but haven't yet yeah um and you know there's all these issues with like funding for core Bitcoin devs like frustration that they don't get enough and can't maintain it what is your view towards uh Bitcoin I mean I love Bitcoin I honestly I don't really understand why um anybody might think the opposite I've kind of like dedicated but people do right I mean I'm not wrong um there is kind of a meme all been abused by Bitcoin Maxis at one time or another I think that's unfortunate um I I don't know how seriously to take that I mean I do I do see people say this on Twitter sometimes but I don't ",
        "20": "know if it's like a widely believed thing I mean it would sort of defy credulity right I mean I've kind of almost dedicated my life to like Bitcoin and helping it grow I mean literally I read the Bitcoin white paper and then decided to quit my job and found this company um now of course the industry has evolved into many things right I mean there's lots of new Innovations coming out in crypto but yeah I'm very Pro Bitcoin and I think look I think the there's a very simple base case for for Bitcoin which is that it's the gold standard in the crypto economy and I think that that'll probably always be true and it'll keep growing now if things like lightning continue to get traction I think it could also become like a settlement layer there's um there's people now creating nfts in Bitcoin and so yeah it's evolving um I'm as an operator of an exchange and custodian um I try to just be agnostic I don't my job is to say is not to tell our customers which coin they should use it is to list and make available every coin that meets our our standards the legal tests I discussed and then we need to be ",
        "21": "agnostic so I think some people because I'm not um Pro one coin or another they sort of take that as like you must hate this thing but those are two different things going back to the SEC Au it does seem like SEC is sort of in enforcement mode and there's a chance that you wake up tomorrow and there's a bunch of new announcements wouldn't you think the ultimate goal is for the SEC when it comes to crypto do they just want it to go away entirely or are they aiming for you know the industry to still exist but maybe in a in a different um in a different way or at JP Morgan and City instead of coinbase and yes well I mean I always I want to be hesitant to kind of speculate on the motives of people within the SEC I mean um I think we have a pretty good relationship with different people and staff and Commissioners and um I I guess the real answer is I don't know I I suspect that there are different people ",
        "22": "with different views inside the SEC I think it wouldn't surprise me if some people their um view they actually just want it to go away they wish this whole thing would go away I think I don't think I would hope that that's not a majority view I know it's not the majority of you of of Americans and I don't see what how it'd be in the interest of America or you know protecting consumers to wish it would go away because clearly it's not one in five households in the U.S are using this stuff and they're just going to use unregulated things offshore if we don't get our act together in the U.S so I think the majority of you is more like we know that this is going to exist we just need to bring it within the regulatory perimeter I wish that they were doing that by just again publishing a clear rule book and going through a rulemaking process with industry but um that hasn't happened as much to date and so you know if it needs to be more enforcement based and then some of this stuff gets uh figured out via case law I mean that's okay too it'll just take a little longer why do you think that regulatory response has so far been kind of disjointed I think it's fair to say ",
        "23": "like maybe disjointed or unclear was it a lack of resources or Regulators just didn't understand the space what was it maybe you can clarify what do you mean disjointed well I guess um slow maybe and unclear you know to your point right this idea right oh man I frankly I I you know I'm spending a lot more time in DC I'm trying to figure this out too perhaps I was a little naive coming in I kind of assumed that um you know when you're running a business that The Regulators just give you the rules and then you just follow them you know that would have been like how I assumed it would work but um it seems to be more complicated than that maybe it's like there's various political motivations there's different factions within the government who have different goals um you know people who've gotten legislation passed they've told me it's kind of like a small miracle whenever it happens you have to kind of get the house in the Senate and and the president all aligned and the you know ",
        "24": "there has to be a real impetus for it to happen um I kind of believe this thing with FDX isn't maybe that impetus Maybe This is Our Moment to finally get some clarity in the next year a regulatory question they're not about not SEC related um it seems like some banks are debanking crypto companies but it does I do not get the impression that that is a risk for coinbase do you perceive that to be a regulatory Advantage for you that's smaller exchanges may have a harder time getting a banking partner in this environment well look I mean I'd hate to consider that to be an advantage um I you know we haven't had any issue with any of our bank Partners I do think that there's a there's a general um moment in the wake of FTX where you know reasonably so um Bank Regulators are uh asking tough questions and they're and they're basically coming in and saying what are the liquidity risks if you're going to take crypto deposits um you know is it is it okay to be ",
        "25": "making loans against those deposits or are they too risky and um I think those are totally fair questions to ask so yeah I don't think that we would have any kind of um major Crackdown and say well you can't Bank crypto companies I haven't I haven't heard that from any anybody and by the way that that would be probably exceeding their Authority because Congress has to make those kinds of decisions about what is allowed in the economy um but if they're coming in and asking questions about liquidity I think that's probably reasonable quick follow-up on that um would you or have you put any lobbying or any of your DC efforts towards guaranteeing or making sure that anyone provide you know provided other basic checks that like that crypto can't be I guess uh discriminated against within the banking system is that an effort you've made well I'm certainly in our messaging and in our conversations with members of Congress and the Senate we have made that point to them which is we want to just be treated on a Level Playing Field right don't unfairly penalize crypto versus traditional financial services ",
        "26": "but um you know you shouldn't like allow us to have a lighter weight system or anything like that either so it's it's a balance um you know we've mentioned this a couple of times but I'd be curious to get your take on what happened to FTX like when when you know that one week in November I think was shocking for a lot of people um for very different reasons depending on who you are but what was it like for you when when you saw um you know it happened so quickly you had the Twitter exchanges and then you had a bankruptcy file I think filing within like seven or ten days yeah I mean that that was a wild week um I was actually in Japan at that time uh meeting with our team there and talking with um regulators and government folks in Japan and I got a call from somebody who said um it's bad like we think FTX is going to go down in the next 48 hours and Sam I go to jail and I was like okay tell me more what happened and I kind of started to piece it all together um you know I had a chance to chat just briefly with Sam Actually and CZ during ",
        "27": "that whole thing um and I was just uh Doom scrolling Twitter I suppose like a lot of people and I I the I mean the really the that's not true I mean the first thing that I really thought about was okay what is our exposure to any of this so we immediately went and you know underwrote any of our counterparties including FDX itself but any that might have secondary effects um and then we started to think about okay well this is actually quite validating of our strategy over the last 10 years of being built in the U.S trying to embrace compliance not trying to cut any Corners um how can we make sure that people understand that coinbase is it's not like FTX and I basically thought about it as there's going to be a it's going to be a black eye for the industry but this is ultimately coinbase stands to be a huge net beneficiary of this because it's going to bring an increased focus on compliance and Trust which is what we've been doing for the last 10 years um I want to ask a little bit about you know sorry the price crypto winter and ",
        "28": "obviously there's been a bit of a bounce but the Bounce has basically just been like because the NASDAQ has bounced too and it looks many of these coins sort of look pretty highly correlated to other risk assets and for years I feel like there was this case to investors that they should buy crypto for two reasons one was this new uncorrelated asset class and two in the case of Bitcoin specifically it was really good as an inflation protection thing now and we just got you know we had the highest inflation and for for the years and Bitcoin really hasn't gone anywhere it's flat over the last several years and the coins all seem to by and large at this point seem to more or less be correlated with like the NASDAQ or QQQ or whatever what is the case and what do you feel about like so what's the new case to be made after people have seen narratives these old narratives that the industry was pretty loud about making I'm not saying you I don't know but many in the industry definitely were have not held ",
        "29": "up in terms of like the case for investing in it yeah well I guess for I'm just sort of laughing a little bit because um you know crypto being has been roughly as volatile as the stock market recently and um I can tell you there was many years of coinbase where people would constantly ask me it's so volatile no one will ever use it so now that it's just on par with volatility of the stock market um I'll take that as a slight win at least a step in there I don't use Tesla shares to buy coffee either so yeah yeah but anyway well okay so obviously we have stable coins for Commerce now which which is a good uh piece of the puzzle um but let's go back to your question about um in an inflation hedge yeah so you know I think there certainly was this uh belief and I frankly I shared this belief too which was that um crypto Bitcoin specifically actually this is where people hopefully the Bitcoin Maxi's kind of aligned with my thinking is that that is sort of the new gold standard in the crypto economy and it would be something that people flee to in times of uncertainty with guaranteed scarcity and things like that um just you know similar to like real ",
        "30": "estate has a you can't make more of it so um at least the Land part of it so there is sort of a guaranteed scarcity component it's a nice insulation hedge um now I think what happened is I was frankly surprised to see how quickly crypto came down in an event an environment of high inflation where I thought maybe the world has shifted maybe we're ready now where this would be considered the an inflation hedge it turns out we were way too early for that now I think my I guess my current updated thinking on that is that we still need probably crypto is still too small a percentage of the global economy to it's being treated more like a growth uh you know asset or something as opposed to like a true um like a gold standard or something and so I mean we probably need the crypto economy to grow 10x 20x or something from here to start to have that sort of a role in the broader macro environment okay you know you mentioned stable coins there and I just remembered once upon a time um I guess a few years ago we had Sam Bateman freedom and we asked him to explain to us what would happen if tether just suddenly collapsed ",
