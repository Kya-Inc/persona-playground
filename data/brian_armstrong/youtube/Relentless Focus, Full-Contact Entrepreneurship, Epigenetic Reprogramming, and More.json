        "0": "[Music] thank you [Music] hello boys and girls ladies and germs this is Tim Ferriss welcome to another episode of the Tim Ferriss show I'm going to keep my Preamble short because I want to get into the meat and potatoes of this conversation with my guest Brian Armstrong he is the co-founder and chief executive officer of coinbase founded in 2012. coinbase is building the crypto economy a more fair accessible efficient and transparent Financial system enabled by crypto coinbase serves over 103 million verified users 14 500 institutions and 245 000 ecosystem Partners in more than 100 countries in April 2021 coinbase listed publicly on the NASDAQ as coin before founding coinbase Ryan served as a software engineer at Airbnb where he focused on ",
        "1": "fraud prevention before Airbnb Brian founded and was CEO of universitytutor.com and online tutoring directory and a subsidiary of Johnson educational Technologies LLC Brian also served previously as a consultant for the Enterprise risk management division at Deloitte and touch LLP Brian as ba in computer science and economics and an MS in computer science from Rice University over the last three years coinbase has worked with 10-time Emmy award-winning filmmaker Greg Koz on a documentary about cryptocurrency and coinbase coin that is the name of the documentary is now available on Amazon iTunes Vimeo on demand and other platforms you can find Brian on Twitter which I suggest you follow at Brian underscore Armstrong Ryan nice to see you thanks for making the time yeah thanks Tim for having me on the show appreciate it sometimes in the course of doing research I find a gingerbread trail that leads me to the story before the story before the story and this may be a dead end but I'm going to give it a shot what was ",
        "2": "startbreakingfree.com does this ring a bell for you that's impressive you found that yeah so that that's a Blog that I started and you know I actually decided when I was right out of college I was working on that Tutoring company somehow I got the idea in my head that I should write a book and I think what I was doing was I was whenever I want to try to learn something or figure it out I try to write it down now I just do blog posts it seems a lot easier but at the time I was like let me I really wanted to be an entrepreneur I wanted to build a company that was meaningful and you know most people would probably go do that first and then write the book but I somehow got it backwards and was like you know what let me write the book to figure out how to do it so I wrote a book called start breaking free and then after I wrote this I didn't have a publisher or anything I was I was kind of doing a self-publishing thing and I read a book called How to Market your book and you know I basically realized that I had to go make a blog or something to try to market the book so I started I created this blog honestly the blog probably was more impactful in my life than than the ",
        "3": "book in the sense that I just put something out every week I got reactions from the audience in real time so now my I guess my takeaway from that was if I was going to do that again I'd probably just go with a Blog and if I had a Blog that had 10 or 12 15 posts that had really resonated with people I'd maybe later package those into a book and add a few more that were unique or something like that but yeah at the time that was I got the order wrong and I was just trying stuff so that's what I put out there sometimes it's the things you throw against the wall that sort of in retrospect form the puzzle that helps you to do so many things and I suppose one of the experiences I'd love to at least bring up since we have this shared time in Argentina is your period of time in Buenos Aires and it's hard for me to say it that way in all scientists and I'd like to hear specifically what you took away not just the experience of witnessing hyperinflation which I do think we ",
        "4": "should talk about but anything else that struck you culturally or otherwise and also why Argentina in the first place of all the places you could go and and if you could just Place Us in time in terms of how old you are when in your life this happens I think I was probably 28 or 27 something in that time frame and I graduated from college I'd been working on this tutoring startup I tried working at a couple different companies like Deloitte you know frankly I wasn't feeling very successful I hadn't really found a company that I wanted to work at I thought I wanted to be an entrepreneur but the Tutoring company I had started was kind of limping along fairly successful I mean I I was kind of paying my rent type thing but barely and it wasn't really growing and you know I had this sense of like okay I want to go have some Adventure in the world I want to learn how to do a startup in a different way I had never really tried living abroad like studying abroad and there was part of me that was like I just I need to grow up I need to try something crazy and just get Adventure in my life and I had never been to South America and I knew a ",
        "5": "little bit of Spanish from high school but I was not very fluent at all and so I decided you know what I'm gonna go do a year spend a month in every major city in South America travel around try to find myself I was kind of doing like a vision quest to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and I can't remember how I chose Buenos Aires but that was intended to be my first destination of of many one per month roughly I think I just read some stuff online I think you were I remember what time frame you were down there but I think I read your book maybe a couple of years after that or something yeah timing was kind of odd I basically made it down there to Buenos Aires didn't really have a place to stay or anything I was intentionally kind of throwing myself into like an unfamiliar situation and you know I ended up staying at a hostel I found finally a room to rent I figured out how to use an ATM got a local cell phone and after a month I was finally settled a little bit and I was like all right I don't want to go have to do that all over again in Brazil or Chile so I was like let me stay here a little bit longer long story short I ended up staying there about a year and did a few trips into ",
        "6": "neighboring countries and things like that but mostly planted myself in Buenos Aires and I don't know I guess the root of your question is kind of like what I took away from it I mean I can tell you at the time I felt very lost and in hindsight you can look back and sort of connect some dots and like think about oh hyperinflation and that kind of stuff but I don't know one of the other things I I guess I haven't talked about before that I sort of realized while I was there was that you know the culture of that country was just incredibly different from the US right which is maybe an obvious statement but the the thing that stood out to me was that there wasn't optimism about the future right people kind of had this Vibe like keep your head down you know don't do anything too crazy because everything could get taken away from you tomorrow and there was like I saw a rampant corruption in various places where you know businesses were all kind of operating in the gray occasionally there'd be like the Fire official would come in and you know quote close a restaurant for safety issues but they were really trying to get some payout it was kind of a gray market and what I saw was I think what ",
        "7": "happens when you have a once great superpower right like Argentina I think was like the eighth largest economy in the world or something in 1900 and then 100 years later you know it was basically a hundred years of just mismanagement corruption bad government endless protests and the people sort of misplaced their faith in the government to do good things whereas ideally like it would have been individuals empowering themselves in free markets and that is kind of in my belief What hap what caused the United States to this unique experiment in the United States to really turn it into a world superpower and so seeing the change of optimism to pessimism in that country just after 100 Years of you know bad outcomes and feeling like you were powerless that was something that did sort of stick with me and so I hope it doesn't come across too negative Argentina has many beautiful things about it as well culturally and I learned many things just about valuing like family and good food and experiences and things like that but from an optimism about the future point of view it was it could not have been more different ",
        "8": "I can corroborate that I was in Argentina 2004 to 2005 and so this was a few years after the 2001 economic meltdown which they seemed to almost like clockwork have every you know five to ten years which we could talk about separately but the degree of apathy was jarring almost and I mean I do think that for the portenos there's a the people in in the in the capital they're famous for complaining even by the standards of the people in the provinces so you have to take a little bit of that along with things but as you said there's there was very little sense of optimism and I remember talking to a shoe store owner who said at one point you know the equivalent of the first lady came in with security guards shut down the store and just grabbed anything that she wanted and she ",
        "9": "was like thank you very much and walked out of the store without paying and I mean that I think is a reflection of the broader perception that people had of the government and I remember walking around in 2004 and still there was graffiti all over the banks and which some of which still had chains locking the doors shut from when people were prevented from withdrawing their cash savings in panic mode because of hyperinflation but the banks themselves effectively close the doors and wouldn't allow them to withdraw so you had vultures and thieves and so on in Spanish on the sides of all these Banks let's hop to present day I mean I'm very curious because I I think there are many ways to spin apocalyptic scenarios that are not all together likely but when you look at the macroeconomic climate currently we're recording this in October of 2022. ",
        "10": "are there any facets in particular that you find concerning or think that people are not paying enough attention to in the broader economy I mean I don't know the main thing I just I've been thinking about a lot is Ray dalio's recent book you know principles for a changing World Order and I thought he did a really good job of just kind of looking back at history and teasing apart some of these patterns and so when I I found the book convincing you know I haven't dug into the data myself he put a lot of it online but it's not just like his opinion he's trying to he's trying to base it on facts of history and I don't know my observation is that I don't think America is in any kind of like imminent danger of Rapid decline but I do think it is in slow decline that that part seems pretty likely to me and so you see a lot of these telltale signs of you know increasing polarization and like media starts to get more polarized and captured by you know various political organizations ",
        "11": "we're seeing higher inflation obviously and that's that's worrisome you kind of go on down the list so you know I think this particular moment where whether we're in a recession or not I my guess is that will be you know something kind of like the 2008 crisis or whatever which you know ironically is the birth of Bitcoin and what came out of that yeah so I don't think it'll be massive in terms of like the whole you know the US isn't like going to just fall apart overnight but I do think it's in slow Decline and so it raises a lot of interesting questions about what is the next World Order is that China is it something that's going to be more decentralized and internet-based kind of like the network states that biology has written about and I think crypto probably has a big part to play in this future because you know we really are building a new economy the crypto economy it's more Global and decentralized and I think a lot of people were thinking in this current macro environment when we saw High inflation hey maybe maybe people will now go to bitcoin as the the reserve currency or not the currency but you know like the digital gold ",
        "12": "equivalent and it didn't Bitcoin went down along with the broader economy and so it seems like people are still treating Bitcoin as a growth Tech stock equivalent or something but my guess is that that's going to change in the next five years or 10 years something like that and we will start to see the crypto economy start to become you know maybe over 10 or 20 years it'll become the main thing it's sort of in the way that e-commerce back 20 years ago was sort of a sideshow but now it's kind of the main thing and so I think we'll see that happen with crypto too so let's rewind for a moment and then we'll we'll go back and forth chronologically because I I like the Memento Style of uh of conversation but if we go back to very early decisions and V1 coinbase so I watched the coin documentary which I enjoyed a lot there's some raps I have many questions and maybe we'll get to later related to being a private person but also inviting a film crew to follow you around especially in many of those ",
        "13": "private contexts but yeah one of the key moments appeared to be the decision to put a buy Bitcoin button on coinbase so I'd love for you to just paint a picture for folks who may not know any of the Genesis story what the traction looked like what the activity looked like for coinbase prior to that and then most important or interesting to me is how you arrived at that decision and thought about that decision and then what happened afterwards so before that decision to add the buy Bitcoin button we had no traction really things were flat and this is not uncommon by the way in startups there is something called the startup hype cycle I think if you Google that you'll find some Google images and it it beautifully illustrates the process that a lot of startups go through where you have this kind of you launch and there's a big spike and then it comes down to zero because nobody cares they're just busy with all the other stuff they're doing in the world and you have kind of the trough of sorrow and then you keep working on the product and you you know ",
        "14": "that's where a lot of startups die but if you go through it you know usually for like years you have to kind of do this iteration of like talk to the customer improve the product talk to the customer improve the product and if you don't die you don't get distracted you don't get disillusioned you'll sometimes see these like Wiggles of Hope and eventually maybe if you're lucky you'll find product Market fit and the thing will take off so this is what they they drill into you and you're when you go through Y combinator which coinbase did and it's sort of a startup incubator where they teach you all these kind of War Stories and so that's what I was doing at this time as like a you know aspiring entrepreneur I was I had launched an early version of coinbase just on Reddit and places like that you know I'd gotten a couple hundred people to come sign up and check it out and then nobody would come back and so what I did was I followed the Y combinator advice and I emailed I just emailed five of the people who had signed up and I said hey I made this this app I'd love to get your feedback can I hop on the phone with you here's my cell phone number so I talked to five of these people and I think it was like the third or fourth person I was talking to and the guy was like yeah I mean the app ",
        "15": "seems cool and everything but like I don't really have any Bitcoin so I just signed up and then I didn't have any Bitcoin I didn't come back and some kind of light bulb this was like probably the second or third person who had said something like this and I I light bulb went off in my head I was like well if there was a buy a buy button right in the app would you have just done that and he was like yeah probably because you know I don't know it seems difficult like you have to wire money to Japan there's the site Mount gox I don't know it was too much of a hassle so I just didn't do it so I went about putting this simple buy button basically as a hunch based on the user feedback and it was it the button was simple but the thing to actually get that working was very difficult I mean we basically I say we it was kind of like just me at the time very shortly thereafter Fred ursum joined and he he and I co-founded it really but you know I had to go find a bank partner that would allow us to integrate with the ACH Network in the US and convince them what our anti-money laundering policy was and then code up that integration and you know make sure that we were sourcing the Bitcoin once people bought it anyway long story short we got all that working and we launched a simple buy button you could now connect ",
        "16": "your bank account that was the first time that had happened in the US where you could connect a payment method and just buy Bitcoin really simply and that's the moment we had product Market fit it started to grow organically every every week after that and it was like a boulder we were chasing downhill I think I I think I say that in the film as well yeah goes from pushing pushing the boulder uphills to chasing it downhill yeah what was the timing on that was that late 2012 when would that have been yeah that you implemented that button probably late 2012 early 2013 was right around then yeah that would have been also exactly at the encouragement of Kevin rose that I bought my first Bitcoin on coinbase would have been literally few months after that button was introduced so yeah thanks for that yeah actually I went I did an interview with Kevin I think right around that time I did interview him at his house and uh I think that that's a fun interview to go back and look at too but yeah crazy times he makes a cameo in the dock as well which you may or may not know but I'm sure he'll be I'm sure he'll be pleased with so I'd like to talk about ",
        "17": "influences and maybe we'll start with a a shared a shared figurehead and that is Richard Feynman so I've I've read quite a few of your blog posts and you've written about books that have had an impact on you or that you recommend to others one of them is surely you're joking Mr Feynman that's That's a classic on my bookshelf that I revisit pretty often there's a lot of backstory there let's begin with that book is there anything about Feynman or that book that that really stands out to you or you would reflect to people who are not familiar with the book and then what other books come to mind that have had a maybe a disproportionate impact on your thinking or that you've simply gifted a lot or recommended much to other people that book definitely did stand out to me and I think I think the thing that was exciting about it was he was just had this kind of curiosity for life and a ",
        "18": "you know Boundless Energy to go try different things and Tink around and experiment and I guess what I loved about that was I mean first of all it's just it's just funny it's quite a humorous book but I guess what I loved about it was like it gave you this kind of zest for life of like never stop learning always be curious and also just you can kind of treat life like it's a video game right like other other people have talked about this that this is not my original stuff but I think there is something to that where if you stop taking life so seriously and you realize anything around you you know there was like that Steve Jobs quote like everything around you was made by somebody else who just decided like you don't have to just consume the world the world is not happening to you you can go create things in the world right and so once you start to think of it like that it really changes your perspective like just one example would be if you're going through something really difficult you might start to get kind of down right you're like oh man this sucks and this person hates me and I'm I'm losing on this or whatever but if you start to think about if life was a video game you ",
        "19": "know the hardest part of the game might be like kind of the most interesting or the most fun it's like the part that you really need to pull together and anyway it just changes your your perspective entirely you asked about other books too I mean let's see I already mentioned dalio's Book Changing world order I thought that was good I've gifted that to a handful of people you know I think Milton Friedman has this book called free to choose I actually have never read the book but there was a TV series he did on PBS back in the day that was also called free to choose and I thought that was kind of interesting I mean it's it's kind of libertarian so some people will like that some people won't but I I found it actually quite interesting just to like get his view on sort of the global macro environment in different countries and how they work and that was something I've also gone back to look at once in a while I think it did influence my thinking in hindsight I want to come back to something you said which was talk to the customer iterate talk to the customer iterate and just to maybe State the obvious which is very often entrepreneurs try to iterate without ",
        "20": "talking to the customer and one of the things I appreciate about many of the founders who've gone through y combinator this includes the Airbnb Founders and others is in the early days doing things that don't scale right really taking a manual approach to interacting with customers what else would you consider core principles or learnings that you took away from y combinator or polygram specifically or anyone else involved well I don't know if this came up in your research but actually I worked at Airbnb before starting coinbase so yes indeed yeah I mean I was I think it was Employee 40 there or something like that and then I got to learn a lot from them too about yeah the perseverance and how they ran product and all it was really cool but I guess some of the lessons just generally from that that ecosystem because it all came from by combinator and Airbnb and all that stuff I mean another one of my favorite kind of polygramisms is action produces information right so ",
        "21": "there's many times where you're sitting around and you're like all right well what if this happens what if that happens and you're kind of staring into the abyss like into the cloud the fog ahead of you and you don't really know what to do and so people sometimes get stuck in those environments and they just they never take any action basically but if you just take some steps into the unknown you might not be doing the right thing but oftentimes by doing that action you'll realize what you should have been doing instead there was a great story that kind of went along with this where the early days of coinbase uh actually before it was even called coinbase I was just tinkering on some stuff nights and weekends while I was at Airbnb and I remember um I built this very simple app with a friend of mine I think it was just called Bitcoin wallet or something it may still be on GitHub somewhere but it was basically an Android app and we decided hey we want to make we want to make like a Bitcoin wallet that runs on Android it was supposed to be very simple right and we didn't have any kind of cloud thing behind it it wasn't any sort of a company or anything like that and so we basically ran a full ",
        "22": "Bitcoin node right on the Android phone which at the time people might laugh at it now but at the time Bitcoin nodes were very small and lightweight and they could run on phones and so we coded this thing up and we launched it I was just trying stuff I didn't know what I was doing we weren't even trying to make a company we were just kind of like trying to learn this stuff in the evenings in our free time and I launched it I remember the minute that we launched it that was like wired wrote some little article about it I was like wow that's so cool wired wrote an article about it but the minute we launched it I realized we had built it wrong and the reason I realized that was that we were trying to again we were running the whole Bitcoin node right on the phone and it would take forever like every time you open the app it would say syncing and it would have to sync like for three four minutes or whatever to catch up with the latest blockchain blocks and so that was a good example where like I knew it instantly we'd built the wrong thing and then what went off in my head was okay someone's gonna have to make a company around this that has a truly like a lot of this stuff running in the cloud where you can do all the backups and security and sync with the blockchains and and I was I remember thinking at that time oh that's not going to be me because I have a day ",
        "23": "job and like that's a really serious company to run and someone will probably try to hack into it and it's like you got to have like a lot of money for that so I didn't I didn't immediately get to the next step was maybe I'll start that company but it that was a good example of just taking action produced information which made the next step a little bit more clear do you have any favorite essays by Paul I have one bookmarked that I reread often I mean he's got so many good essays but the top idea in your mind not that you should be familiar with that one but that that's one since I have a creative project that I'm focused on at the moment that I revisit with some regularity yeah any favorite essays or other Paul Graham isms that come to mind you know there's so many good ones I think people should read them all but there's one about I think it's about how to how to build wealth or something it just really nicely explains the idea where people think money is zero sum it's like well for me to have money you have to you have to take it from somebody else so it's like inherently evil and he's like no you know if you just like assemble a bunch of things ",
        "24": "either natural resources or you improve a car I think is the way he described it he's like you haven't made anybody else worse off like you you made the mechanic better off and like when you sell the you know but you made yourself better off in the process and so value is not Zero Sum I think that's really important for people to understand and once in a while I go back and read his essay I think it's called haters whenever I'm feeling down like people are whenever I accidentally read the comments online which is not a good idea that's a good one to go back and read too amazing I'm looking at two of them so haters that's January 2020 and then I think this is the wealth essay which is how to make wealth from May 2004 which originally came from his book hackers and Painters so I will put both of those in the in the show notes so let's talk about sort of psycho emotional response to outside scrutiny or criticism for a second because ",
        "25": "what is what is covered quite extensively in the dock and certainly was covered even more extensively in the news was your decision not that long ago to offer a generous Severance packages to people who disagreed with your statements about coinbase as a mission-driven company that provides a refuge of sorts with that Focus that and please correct my description if it doesn't fit but and in so being a mission-driven company wanting to avoid sort of political and social conversations within the company that that chew up time and energy and resources and attention feel free to to set the table a little better than I did but can you describe the situation the action ",
        "26": "and then what is what is of greatest interest to me is how you thought about making the decision how you thought about the possible ramifications of making that decision and prepared yourself for what might happen and then what did happen just weathering that a few years back we put out this blog post that coinbase was going to become a mission focused company which basically meant we were going to be a political not focus on broader societal issues in the workplace and so how did that all come to be I mean really I'd say for the couple of years prior to that there was something that was sort of bubbling up inside the company which initially was very slow and subtle and I didn't really pay too much attention to it but eventually it culminated in a walkout a bunch of employees being so upset that they kind of closed their laptops and decided not to come into work in protest and that was sort of the a big moment in the company history because that had never happened before and so what what led up to that well that basically there was a lot of you ",
        "27": "know covet happened people were at home they were probably had less of a sense of belonging and cohesion as hey we're all one company we're one group of people we're all trying to do good stuff in the world so there was a little bit of frustration there there was probably a lack of cohesion there and then I'd say there just it became more popular in society I've since gone back and read some books on this like um you know Jonathan Heights book about the colleague of American mind and all these things that kind of started on college campuses I I sort of loosely read a few things here and there about this but I never really took it that seriously I figured this was just you know there's always been activism on college campuses whatever we're trying to build something in our company I didn't pay much attention to it but what happened was we started to get basically more activism inside the company whereas like initially I was always thinking hey we're on the same team we've got competitors we've got Regulators we've got we're trying to create all this change we're all on the same team and internally people started to think actually we're not all on the same team my job is not to help the coinbase mission it's to hold you know speak truth to power or to hold this other team you know to account or ",
        "28": "something like that and so it manifested in strange ways like at the Town Hall meetings that we'd have every two weeks we don't have an open mic q a and more and more of the questions started to be about things not really related to what we were building as a company but to about broader societal issues and it almost became this this like thing where who could make the exec team squirm the most on stage and you know with these very difficult questions and of course I didn't have great answers to many of the biggest broader societal issues we were trying to all focus on building a more more economic freedom in the world so as I was noticing this was happening this was around the time of the George Floyd riots and everything like that and the murder there and so there was a moment I think where somebody in one of the All Hands kind of came up and said um is coinbase going to publicly support black lives matter and I basically deferred to answer the question I hadn't really read that much about it I was like we're gonna go look at this I don't know to be determined and that wasn't good enough and they kind of held the mic and they pressed the issue and this is where a bunch of people walked out of the company so this was I was frankly ",
        "29": "shocked I was like At first I was just so surprised we all got in a room as an exec team and I I was like what I don't understand what does coinbase have to do with police brutality like we're not we're not related to this but of course this thing was erupting all over societies all over the world and people just felt every company every person ever had to make some kind of a stand on this and so it was a very difficult leadership moment I remember calling some people into the room telling me and asking them what does BLM actually stand for if we're going to go out there and like say something positive about it and you know they're like well it's basically equality for you know people and I was like great okay if that's what people want to hear I don't understand it but let's let's go out there and say it and so I basically went out and made a statement supporting BLM as many companies did at that time and um people came back to work which was fine but as the months ticked by I started to feel increasingly uneasy about it first of all I subsequently learned that BLM supported other things like around defunding the police and all these things which I was like all right we shouldn't be getting involved in those issues I I don't know what our point of ",
