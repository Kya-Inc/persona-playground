        "0": "the following is a conversation with brian armstrong co-founder and ceo of coinbase the largest cryptocurrency exchange platform with 98 million users in 100 countries listing bitcoin ethereum cardano and over 100 popular cryptocurrencies i recorded this conversation with brian before this week's sec probe into whether some of the crypto listings are securities and thus need to be regulated as such as always with conversations that involve cryptocurrency i try to make it timeless so that the price soaring high or crashing down low doesn't distract from the fundamental technological economic social and philosophical ideas underlying this new form of money energy and information our world runs on money the exchange and store of value and cryptocurrency seeks to build the next chapter of how money works and what it can do coinbase and brian are trying to do this ",
        "1": "by working together with regulators and governments which is a long and difficult road bureaucracies resist change for better and for worse the latest sec probe is a good representation of this it is a serious attempt to limit fraud but one that also runs the risk of limiting innovation and limiting financial freedom of individuals this is a complicated mess and i applaud everyone involved for trying to work through it i hope in the end the interest of the individual wins decentralization after all is a hedge against the corrupting nature of centralized power this is the lex friedman podcast to support it please check out our sponsors in the description and now dear friends here's brian armstrong let's start with the fact that you're a programmer what was the first program you've ever written or the first one that you remember the first memory i have of programming was probably in middle school and i remember it was recess ",
        "2": "and they had this like this time period where you could read books and the other kids were like reading comic books and stuff and for some reason i had gotten into decide yet i wanted to get into computers and i was playing with computers at home and so i got this book i think from the library it was called like how to learn java in 30 days so i was i was reading this book at like you know the recess and i didn't understand anything and i remember i went home and i tried to get this thing working and you know if you've ever written a java program the first lines are like public static void main string args or whatever and it's just like it's so foreign and it's so difficult to get started and so i was kind of frustrated i was like i don't understand anything that's happening in this book so the first the first thing i wrote was probably just like a hello world app in java but it was so i felt like i was so confused about what was actually happening that i later learned a bit of php and php was like more fun for me because it was like oh just print out what you want you know it ",
        "3": "didn't have all this complexity around it so then i got more into php i started building like some simple websites i think learned some html so i think that was my introduction to programming at least the very beginning part yeah you know java has a lot of uh out of all the hello worlds you can possibly write java is the one where i think it's the longest yeah it's just which is quite interesting because java is often at least for a long time was used as the primary programming language to teach people how to program or at least about object-oriented programming i think most universities have now switched in high school switched to python i'm not sure if that's the case probably better it's easier to learn it lowers the it makes it less scary there's like less of a hurdle and certainly none of them use php i love php and i feel like it's a dirty secret i have to keep private to myself like it's somebody i'm seeing on the side or something like that because uh it's just not a respected programming language because i think there's so many ways you can write poor code with php yeah which is why ",
        "4": "it's not respected yeah it's a scripting language more so although of course facebook built like a huge stack on top of it and valuable company but i still love ruby to this day ruby is probably my favorite language python is great too but i just love the idea behind ruby that it's like let's make it easier for the human harder for the computer and make it a joy to be expressive and all these things so i was never the best computer scientist but i was a good i was good hacker i could rapidly prototype products and using languages like ruby do a lot of computer science programs still use like lisp and scheme and things like that no no they do for that's like that's if you're hardcore if you're legit you're gonna do some of the functional languages yeah i think there's a there's a few others that popped up but lisp is a distant memory for a lot of people that's like somebody has to like you go to library you dust off the book yeah but uh scheme a little bit i think if you're starting i mean there's courses about languages themselves like programming languages ",
        "5": "yeah this might be one of those you know how there's languages that nobody uses anymore like ancient languages yeah you might have to go to school in that same way for programming languages yeah back in the day we used to use parentheses i of course still use emacs as the editor for most things that i do and emacs is is um you know a lot of the customization you can do is in lisp and that's the language probably when i first really fell in love with programming is lisp because for a long time throughout the earlier history of artificial intelligence list was the primary language but it still had a life in the 90s and the arts where some people would use it such a beautiful functional language but it just somehow didn't pick up um that said i should say sort of push back php i feel like it's still true that most of the web runs on php most of the back end is still is still php ",
        "6": "so if you look at you know it's like the stuff that people don't talk about it's like what what runs most systems in the world what runs the most uh back end what runs most front end yeah javascript you know html script i think the stack exchange surveys show javascript's most popular language in the world i think right oh yeah in terms of programmers and numbers of i wonder by survey of number of programmers on stack stack overflow yeah but that's also the cutting edge right those are the people that are just like excitedly writing code i wonder if there's there's people that are just like maintaining gigantic code bases yeah i feel like the amount of java out there just running industrial systems has got to be enormous and then of course in the banking industry finance it's like even older stuff cobalt and whatnot but i've been actually looking for somebody uh to interview who who represents uh cobalt ",
        "7": "unfortunately like who's the figure still still there that holds the flag i did you know with java founder of java creator of java creator python creator of c plus plus but nobody wants to hold the flag for cobalt unfortunately even though some of the most important systems in the world still run on those yeah uh like power systems and infrastructure systems which is fascinating which and atms and stuff like that like a lot of stuff that we rely on that just works and the reason we don't change it because it works well yeah it's written in languages that people don't use anymore yeah that'd be a cool series of interviews get get the stuff that's like tech that was invented 40 50 years ago but still is being used widely i mean emacs is an example of that let me ask the big question of uh what are cryptocurrency exchanges and what's coinbase how does it work before i'll ask even bigger questions but it's just a nice kind of pilot cleansing question of what is ",
        "8": "coinbase coinbase is a cryptocurrency exchange brokerage custodian basically we're the primary financial account for people in the crypto economy how they buy crypto how they store it how they use it increasingly in different ways we can talk about that um so yeah we want to be the way that a billion people hopefully access the open financial system globally how does it work what uh what's cryptocurrency you know there's uh there's bitcoin there's ethereum um what does it mean to be an exchange what does it mean to store what does it mean to transact how does it what does coinbase actually do okay so you know basically in any given market there's some people want to buy some people who want to sell and there's you keep an order book of all those prices and then um you know if someone's willing to buy for more than the lowest price someone's willing to sell then you know you get a ",
        "9": "trade to execute that's kind of how an exchange works underneath and a brokerage is kind of simpler than that even you don't have to know look at the whole order book and everything but you just go in there and you say i want to buy 100 of bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrency you get a quote and if you like it you can hit accept and you know the core things that we do to make all that kind of just work make it seamless it sounds simple on the surface is we gotta we have to do payment integrations you know in a variety of places around the world to make it easy for people to get fiat currency into this ecosystem we have to work on cyber security a lot there's lots of hackers out there trying to break into our systems and steal crypto or to put stolen credit cards and bank accounts and things like that into these systems um we have to integrate with the blockchains themselves right which are periodically getting updated and having various airdrops and all kinds of things so we're integrated with lots of different blockchains and then we have to store the crypto that people buy securely as well so crypto is kind of like storing you store the private keys essentially ",
        "10": "and we've invented a lot of cool technology about how to do that securely that helps me sleep at night as one of the largest crypto custodians out there so those are some of the pieces that had to come together to get that early simple buy sell experience to work and yeah i mean coinbase actually has a lot of different products now so we have like an institutional product uh we we have coinbase commerce which is like merchant payments like stripe for crypto we've got a self-custodial wallet which we can talk about there's all kinds of cool applications people are building with web3 and they can access it through that we just just launched an nft product um i've gone down the list we have we so we're sort of like a portfolio of crypto products now we're big enough where we can do multiple things but yeah the core thing we got started with and still the majority of our revenue today is people just want to come in and buy and sell some crypto and we help them do that make it simple and easy to use uh and i'll ask you about wallet nft is about what is it called the stripe type coinbase commerce coinbase commerce yeah i'll ask about all that but uh order ",
        "11": "books and exchange what's the difference between that and stocks for example which there's also order books yes i mean stocks trade through order books too uh sort of commodities it's all similar type of situation so when i want to buy one bitcoin and i see coinbase say the price of that bitcoin is say forty thousand dollars and i press buy what happens um yeah okay so you've gotten a lot like you know when you press the button on your keyboard like the electrical signal goes up the wire on your keyboard well that's also important the timing right because it's not pricing yeah it's true it's giving you a quote right that's that's um you know some there's a whole concept of like slippage and like by the time the quote is executed um if the price has moved too much like we may reject it and you know there's there's various things like that but how do i i mean what's the simple version i can give you so we you know we'll we'll basically check the order book give you a quote it's good for some period of time or for ",
        "12": "some amount of slippage and then what's happening is we're initiating a debit to your payment method whether that's a credit card or a bank account or you know you're storing dollars or euros or something on our platform there's various payment methods so we're basically debiting that and then we're crediting you the crypto and uh we're taking a fee for it too so um that's fundamentally what's happening underneath and then there's some interesting slippage how do you how do you calculate the uh how much slippage is allowed like how do you how do you know these things you know because order books are fascinating you know the dynamics of that is pretty interesting yeah and the little i know about it yeah so there's a lot of people like traders who get super into this and like high frequency traders and arbitrage and all kinds of interesting topics flash boys was like an interesting book on this whole thing you want like access to information the fastest sometimes even putting your you know your thing in the data center right next to the thing we don't allow that colo stuff because we want it to be ",
        "13": "more democratized but you know basically you give a let's say we wanted to just keep it math simple we want to charge a one percent fee so if you're buying a hundred dollars of bitcoin and we'll charge you 101 you know we've presented you the amount of bitcoin you're going to get for 100 now let's say 10 seconds later you hit accept we go to we go to fill the order so it's going to be some error bound around that one percent fee right and if we think we're actually losing money on the trade i think we'll often reject it so some part of the fee the slippage is incorporated into that averaged over a large number of people they just just it's fascinating because like even just like that little detail probably requires a lot of experimentation yeah and it's kind of like a giant bug bounty out there because if you get it wrong there's people who are going to arbitrage that and we've we've had people sort of pen test our systems in you know really creative ways where like um they'll just fire like programmatically ",
        "14": "with apis they'll fire off like a million different quotes and look for one of them that's out of bounds and then actually take that money right there and you know we get people doing all kinds of crazy stuff but so how do you protect against that how do you protect so we'll talk about cyber security in interesting ways but there's a lot of clever people trying to do clever things to earn not even just to break into the system but to earn an edge of some kind yeah in the system how do you uh how do you stay one step ahead there's no silver bullet there's a bunch of lead bullets right so it's it's like you know one thing we do is we just have good test suites right so you're testing every piece of code that goes out that's like just common good best practice but it's particularly important in financial services another thing we do is we hire third-party firms to try to audit this stuff and break in another one we do is we have a bug bounty program so we basically pay white hat hackers to find this stuff before the black hats do and we've paid out lots of good bug bounties so ",
        "15": "you know try all the above and occasionally you don't get it right you lose some money and then you fix it and you keep going so yeah let's talk about sebastian security a little bit more yeah you mentioned using stolen bank accounts yeah so that's another one that's another interesting one how do you protect against that okay so fraud prevention yeah is a big topic so one of the there's a lot of things people do but one of the things they do is that you use machine learning right so you look at protector to attack to protect against it so um what you want to do is kind of build up a labeled data set of all the different people who have turned out to be fraudulent and good good actors and hopefully collect as much data as you can and then you'll you know you might feed hundreds or thousands of these factors into your machine learning model it'll come back with a risk score so you know an example of like the kinds of factors people create or put in there you know obviously i don't want to disclose too many of them because it's it's it's a cat and mouse game but just ",
        "16": "kind of i don't know relatively well known stuff might be um you know you have device fingerprints right so like what kind of device are you on and what fonts do you have installed a lot of people who are farming lots of these accounts they're using emulators and like virtual machines and stuff they're not like you know an average person on that device um and then you'll see sometimes like one of my favorite metrics we tracked for for this was called like improbable travel velocity so we would we're tracking people's ips right and you might see someone um who was one day in austin texas and then like an hour later they were in london or something it's like well that's very improbable i mean sometimes people are using vpns so you got to be careful with that because like there's legitimate people who use vpns too but if it's not possible for them to have gotten on a plane and gotten there that quickly then that's usually they're like spoofing a device or ip sometimes those are interesting factors but yeah if you feed enough of these in um you will oh oh the another fun one is like you know real users will type their ",
        "17": "credit card like one number at a time yeah scammers have a list of them and they'll just paste in a whole a whole number um so you can look at like the the number of milliseconds between keystrokes like there's all kinds of stuff people have come up with you for travel velocity you could probably incorporate vpns too because there's probably a travel velocity for vpn switching too that's human-like like if you're using legitimately vpn for something else yeah um that that might be there's like legitimate uses too actually you know i feel embarrassed that i don't know this probably should but the i'm not a robot capture thing capture thing yeah so that probably works in the same way like how do you move your mouse maybe or how the dynamics of the clicking totally but how does that even work that well then and why can't it be fake i need to look into this because it's it's such a trivial captcha it feels like should be very crackable and yet a lot of high ",
        "18": "security places use that yeah it's really interesting it's another cat and mouse game so i think they've yeah but it's using a lot of similar signals like mouse movements um keystrokes and then obviously all the stuff that comes over the the wire with your browser so like what operating system what fonts you know what headers are being sent over and yeah um there's actually there's an old website a camera was called it was kind of like panoptix click or panopticon or something but it basically was like a proof of concept site that um they would just show you all the data that was kind of getting sent over with your your request and like say that there's only one person in the world who has this exact set of data it's you and so it's almost like um a work around a clever workaround to track somebody um make identify a unique person even if like there wasn't a cookie involved or something yeah this is a fascinating world where you can't see anybody you're in the dark and yet you have a lot of signal you have to figure out who's the real person who's not who's a robot who's not yeah uh let me step back we're gonna jump around all over the place step back ",
        "19": "that's why i like your interviews you get into like technical topics so so uh just let's use bitcoin as a measure of time you started coinbase when bitcoin was ten dollars yeah um and you just mentioned an incredible system with security with transactions everything is thought through there's a lot going on but what was version one back in those early days the first prototype of coinbase what did that look like yeah like what what did it take to write it to think through it and and uh make it work enough to at least make you believe that it's gonna work well i definitely didn't know if it was gonna work i mean it was kind of i felt like i was just following my gut so i mean i was working at airbnb i was a software engineer there project manager i was working on some fraud prevention stuff for instance and um i read the bitcoin white paper in kind of december of 2010 i started going to some bitcoin meetups in the bay area ",
        "20": "met lots of interesting people there like crazy people anarchists you know like really brilliant people all the above and so i started nights and weekends trying to hack put together a prototype and my initial thought was well you know smtp is a protocol that runs email and you know git is is a protocol for version control that and but people made like gmail and github they don't most people don't want to run their own email server or even their own git server they just want to like use a hosted thing that you know will do all the security and backups for them so the thought in my head at that time was bitcoin's this new protocol there's probably going to be somebody who makes a hosted service that does all the security and backups for you makes bitcoin as a protocol easy to use so maybe i should maybe i should make like a hosted bitcoin wallet or something that would that was my it was going to make gmail for bitcoin or something and a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea like bunch most of my smart friends who i told about it they were like well first of all i don't really get what you're doing at all like bitcoin ",
        "21": "sounds like a scam or something you got you've gotten involved in um but then other people who understood what bitcoin was told me i thought it was a dumb idea because they're like dude if you store all this bitcoin you're just gonna get hacked like nobody you know why would you why would you do that and so i i kind of had this thought like you know what i'm not gonna go all in and like make a story everyone's bitcoin that would be too much right now i have a job i have a day job you know um but let me just make a prototype and i'll tell people this is like a beta thing like don't put any real money in it and just see if there's interest and if i feel like i'm onto something maybe i'll go do this as a company because i did i really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time i was like i was 29 i was almost turning 30 and i was i always wanted to like start a company but i was i was you know i wasn't yet i was an employee at a company that was great but so anyway i had this prototype i was hacking together nice and weekends i actually wrote a whole bitcoin node in ruby which turned out to be a maybe a weird decision in hindsight because ruby wasn't the most performant language we've subsequently had to rebuild that many times but ",
        "22": "yeah i had this hosted bitcoin wallet and the thing that i didn't have any users for it by the way i applied to y combinator because i was like maybe if somebody there writes me a check this will like make it feel like a real company and i was trying to find i was trying to find a co-founder at that time unsuccessfully so i was basically just wandering in the desert i had a lot of self-doubt about this because i i was like i don't know all my friends don't think's just kind of dumb and maybe bitcoin is just going to get shut down and like this all be some stupid thing so there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost in the desert lots of self-doubt um paul graham and the y combinator group kind of wrote me the first check after i went and interviewed and stuff and they they wrote me a check for like 150k and that was the first time somebody who i really looked up to kind of said this is this is worth pursuing like maybe maybe you're onto something maybe or not but like let's at least try it and so i that was kind of what gave me the confidence to quit my job and try it and um i'll wrap the story here by saying that like we i you know i found the ",
        "23": "right co-founder after y combinator we still didn't have any customers the thing that you know i basically launched the hosted bitcoin wallet there were people signing up um i just posted on reddit and places like that and you know maybe like 100 people would sign up and then nobody would come back and so i was like i just in y comment do they often tell you like you know talk to your customers and improve your product talk to your customers improve your product that's all you're supposed to be doing try to find product market fit so i emailed like five of the users that had signed up and i was like hey i worked on this app i saw you signed up can i get on the phone with you i get on the phone with like five of these folks and i was like you know why didn't you come back and the guy was like well the app was okay for a for a beta but um like i don't have any bitcoins so i didn't really know what to do with it and i remember this light bulb kind of went off my head i was like well if i put a buy bitcoin button in there uh would you have used it and he was like yeah maybe so then i had this we went about the process my co-founder at that time we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership payment rails you know an exchange basic exchange functionality ",
        "24": "all that stuff i was mentioning earlier in place and the minute we launched that feature where you could just click buy put in your bank counter credit card buy it buy bitcoin it showed up in your account from that day forward like the number of users started go up like this and so we finally had found product market fit after two years of laundering in the desert so you weren't even thinking about to buy the on-ramps you would think it would be just a wall a place to store bitcoin you've already gotten yeah okay this is i mean uh because that's such a pain to do to have to work with others to convert dollars of any fiat currency into into bitcoin yeah so did you i mean were you uh overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here or were you just um sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply through this whole thing and just letting the optimism take over here you know i was really looking forward to ",
        "25": "like doing something crazy and like a big challenge and um i wanted to i i love kind of crisis moments like that where you know i'm very determined right especially when i i get like very set on something and i'm just like you know what i'm gonna figure out a way to make this [ __ ] thing work like no matter what and so i i reveled in that i i was sort of i had i had read all these books about startups and like every startup has these like you know major setbacks and just like nothing works and so that was a sign that you're doing something right i had no idea if i was doing anything right at all but i was like i was kind of loving the experience of it in a weird way it felt it felt stressful at the time like you know nothing was working and but i was just i felt like i was on the right path somehow and so i just kept going i don't know um what was the darkest moment that you've gone to in your mind during that time what was what were some of the tougher moments you said self-doubt ",
        "26": "yeah have you uh yeah where where'd you go where'd you go in your mind [Laughter] is there a moment where you're just like laying there this is this is hopeless well there's a couple moments i'm remembering i mean so for whatever reason i had this like big chip on my shoulder at that time and i was like i really want to do something important in the world like you know i could have a good life and like work for some good companies and write some software and i'm for some reason i never wanted that for myself that probably would have been healthier honestly just to like that as an expected value outcome that's probably a better thing in life but i was like i was like man i really want to do something important and have a bigger impact and i was like i was willing to sacrifice a lot for that i was like sleep and not going out with friends and stuff i remember one of the just for like years working on this stuff remember one of the darker moments was um we probably had like maybe five employees at that time ",
        "27": "and i remember like a bunch of bad things happened like all at once and it was so first of all you have to remember at this time we were all very sleep deprived which kind of exacerbates everything if you look at like the exxon valdez spell spill and all these like natural disasters like sleep deprivation is often involved so because the reason why we're so sleep deprived is not just because we were working so much but like the site would go offline in the middle of the night and we'd get i get paged i was like on pager duty so i'd get woken up sometimes like two or three times a night like have to try to fix something go back to sleep so in that environment you can kind of get you can get discouraged so one bad thing that happened was we had a bug on the website and there were thousands of people on reddit and twitter who were all like pissed at coinbase because like the balances were showing wrong and they were just like you know [ __ ] this company it's over like i hate these guys and so that was i'd never had this feeling of a thousand people mad at me at the same time you know i feel like i'm a pretty chill guy like most time people don't get mad at me so that was one another ",
        "28": "one was that um can we pause on that that's so interesting so you you were saying like here's a dream i'm trying to create something and now forever the reputation of this dream is ruined it will never it's irrecoverable it's over that kind of feeling yeah well i didn't you're right i didn't know at that time i was like is this is this the end like everybody we're so we're so tiny now everybody hates us so is it over yeah um yeah nobody told me this before starting a company that like you're a bunch of people hate you for this which is like a very counterintuitive thing because you know if most companies i think are doing good things in the world at least you're trying right and so even if someone's like trying but they're not they're failing i'm generally rooting for them at least you're trying right yeah but that's not the case at all and most founders i've known have gone through this too where um they're very surprised at the amount of hate that they get and if it's i think it's actually like a muscle you can build your tolerance to it like because you know you go talk to somebody who's ",
        "29": "like for you it feels terrible because you're at the center of this storm and like but if you go then you go talk to like you know your family or some other person like dude i didn't even hear about that like my they're just busy in their own life and so they they have no idea that you had all this negative press or like whatever it was can i once again put lingard on that yeah there's an interesting person i'd like to bring up just as an example uh bill gates yeah so he gets a very large amount of hate on the internet yeah and there's something about him this is me talking that you that he seems out of touch about that hate he i i believe at least in my understanding that uh with the resources he has he's trying and is actually doing a lot of good and yet there's a gigantic amount of hate conspiracy theories and stuff like that right and it feels like that's the case because he's somehow out of touch ",
        "30": "with with people so i wonder how you stay in touch with the voice of the people without being destroyed by the outrage is there is there any wisdom you have to that or not i don't know about wisdom but i've thought about this too because yeah you want to always be open to feedback especially from people who have like your best interests at heart right and if you can become isolated from it and just like you know surrounded by yes people and um i mean who knows maybe maybe like she and putin and people like that are in situations i have no idea but if you listen to too much of it and you just try to please everyone you'll never get anything done and i mean most of the best leaders are people who they can act when they believe that they they're doing something net positive for the world and humanity and they actually don't really care if they piss off some proportion of the people almost anything you're going to do of significance in the world today is going to piss off five percent of people maybe ",

        "72": "that means that all the companies in the space are going to be held to a high standard because the minute you lose someone's trust they're going to move their bitcoin to some other service and that's good for the world do you think of coinbase as uh so there's these ideas of layer one layer two layer three technologies yeah do you think of coinbase as layer one layer two layer three now that that said there's so many um products that are under the coinbase umbrella that's hard to answer that question but what do you think yeah do you acknowledge the existence of layer three so so you know usually when people are using those terms layer one layer to this so they're referring to like layer one would be um the blockchain layer one blockchain itself like like a bitcoin or ethereum or something not like a a centralized service like coinbase or even our decentralized um self-custodial wallet so um yeah i wouldn't consider us to be like a layer one these are these are the decentralized protocols that we're integrating but we are coinbase itself ",
        "73": "is not those yes but layer two is the thing that was basically doing transactions without the settlement on the blockchain and so you you get to have some of the benefits of faster transactions without um the the security associated with the blockchain and layer three is i suppose sort of apps built on top of that so you know uh at least i think talking to michael saylor he considers coinbase a layer three technology interesting okay i'm not really particularly familiar with this kind of distinctional there three and two i don't see them as fundamentally different uh but some of the okay i mean one way of asking that is there some layer two like of magic happening in order to make transactions associated with the blockchain happen instant so that they're quick so that coinbase on coinbase yeah um is there some magic going on because ",
        "74": "you're okay we should say how many cryptocurrencies are currently on coinbase so it's more than two yeah it's a lot more than two yeah so you have to understand they have to incorporate all these technologies yeah so how do you make that magic of sort of universal transactions happen across all of these different cryptocurrencies there's our centralized products and decentralized products right the centralized products um we are storing that crypto for you and so if you're moving from one of your accounts to another account like each one account to eth2 account or um from my ether ethe coinbase centralized account to your ether so we can do that transaction off chain to make it faster and it saves the customer fees and it just confirms instantly but it's not truly using the decentralized blockchain right so you can also send to any any bitcoin address or a theorem address for instance and that is putting the transaction on chain now our decentralized products like coinbase wallet the the self custodial wallet ",
        "75": "every transaction is happening on chain with that and so basically what it just shows a little bit of the evolution of coinbase and the blockchains themselves like in the early days um these you know the we these networks were not scalable and so there were no l2 solutions for instance and so we had to do sort of these hacks like moving the crypto off chain if you were moving between your own accounts and stuff like that otherwise the miner fees would have just eaten us alive as a company right and we yeah but now that like the blockchains are starting to scale there's a whole bunch more work that needs to be done on that and we're getting l2 solutions so i think more and more of the transactions are going on chain whether it's l2 l1 and you know we shouldn't be like ideally we shouldn't be doing that many transactions um you know off chain but just internal coinbase ledger or something that's not really in the spirit of crypto so when you say unchained that includes like a lightning net that includes layer layer two technology that the blockchain proposes yeah so you're when you yeah okay so i guess i was asking how much ",
        "76": "fun magic is happening off-chain within coinbase and you're saying in the early days you had to but you try and do less and less so look there's a bunch of like high frequency traders that use the centralized products and even just regular retail people like they don't want to pay the gas fees and stuff and they're trying to it actually we we um back at the envelope you know calculated this out at one point and just like it would be completely infeasible for like high frequency traders to put everything on chain at this point that's basically what dexes are doing and so both are important i think more and more is going to move decentralized over time which is great and we're and we're basically our decentralized exchanges yeah by the way yeah yeah um so anyway we want to we want to encourage more and more of it to move decentralized over time but i don't the centralized things aren't going away for like a long time it's a decade from now there's gonna be some big institution or pension fund or central bank that's like all right we gotta hold crypto let's set up the account in a centralized way so that's that's fine ",

        "128": "and so uh in the digital world they're providing basically almost no value except hosting your paper and they put up a paywall and charge people to access that and that charge is not like even netflix fees you're talking about a lot of money so they're basically blocking your research that should be wide open uh from the world and creating a paywall it's a fascinating like scam that's actually holding back i don't it's it's a shitty scam because you're not making that much money i feel like a definition of a scam you should at least be making money that's like significant amount of money you're basically making shitty money and holding back all of human knowledge okay so that put aside and people get a little confused because the journals aren't the ones paying the scientists people think like the journals are somehow funding the scientists therefore they have the right to put up a paywall ",
        "129": "no no the funding is coming from elsewhere journals yeah are the middle man that nobody asked for especially in the digital world anyway that said there is uh interesting kind of incentives for scientists which is prestige and so on so there's a thing with journals if there's if there's a prestigious journal and you uh pass the review process you get into that journal or a prestigious conference in computer science then that's seen as a good thing in your resume and not just your resume within your community that's a respected thing is there some way to achieve that same kind of incentive in an open um in the open setting of research hub so like where i could say i got x y and z like look i'm impressive because this happened on research hub i think you're right like the whole um academia like progress track is about like where you got published and how many citations and it's kind of like a ",
        "130": "false economy of um reputation because like there's not real money backing it and so i think we've thought about this a little bit um and i think the research hub team has an opportunity to do something here that basically says like okay i had the top paper for 2022 in um you know biology on in here and you basically publish a list a leaderboards of these like top you know for the month the the year um in all these different categories then actually you know we should probably give out grants and awards um in in addition to that fund those people almost like fellows or even give out like you know like the nobel prize there should be like a research hub prize or something and like ship people maybe maybe even ship like a print version of a journal that is the top papers in each category in each month or whatever and like people want to put that in their wall in in the lab and like so i do think we need to sort of change i don't know like the traditional folks in academia or science would ",
        "131": "probably think this is like crazy a crazy idea but i think we need to change the culture to not celebrate getting published in paywall journals almost like friends don't let friends publish in like paywall journals like because that's it's just not helping humanity so like you know it should be more prestigious to publish in an open science way and get the top spot that should be celebrated above being published in whatever i don't even want to name one of them you know well there's currently it's the culture has already shifted to where almost everybody publishes an archive and by archive and so on yeah but so that the culture is there on that that scene friends don't let friends not publish open but then the prestige thing is missing which is like anyone can publish an archive yeah so how do you know it's actually a strong paper now funny enough even with the crappy systems we have now word of mouth is powerful like you have a like citation system is pretty powerful so like you say okay this is a ",
        "132": "strong paper we don't need reviewers our human eyes are the reviewers like that the community are the reviewers so it's already it's like that part is there but it it would be nice to have like uh you know nature level like this is respect this is a respectful accomplishment yeah and something like a leaderboard but a stable kind of system yeah and i should mention so there's a crypto angle to this too which is um so research hub has a coin associated with research coin and it's basically if if people you know upvote your paper or like support it you'll accumulate more research coin which is basically like rep or like a reward token um and so that is a way to um i guess measure the the community's collective view of that paper a form of peer review um and it can even be weighted by like the reputation of the people voting on it and that sort of thing over time um yeah i think the last thing i'll just say is that so i think from from a rep ",
        "133": "like a prestige point of view it won't start off that way it'll probably start off like being a little more quirky like you know like remember when youtube first started it was like people posting weird cat videos and stuff and but now like you know if you have a million subscribers on youtube that's probably better than getting like a tv show on nbc or whoever the traditional gatekeeper was so my hope it might take 10 years 20 years whatever but i'm hoping that this can sort of be the new prestigious way that that young people publish in science and it'll become to be viewed as more prestigious the the journals nutritional journals will be viewed as old-fashioned well it's definitely a system that could do a lot better and there's a lot of incredible brilliant people doing science they deserve better the better platforms yeah uh so another thing you're taking on and helping out with is this new limit which is looking at longevity yeah what's what's the idea there yeah okay so as you can see i'm excited about science like i think you know science is sort of the ",
        "134": "basically if you get scientific innovation then you get um better products and you get better economic growth and then you get all kinds of like surplus in society that can go to arts and philosophy and like all kinds of stuff but um with new limits so yeah i kind of got i started hosting some dinners with scientists um last year and i was learning about all kinds of the latest stuff happening in bio and there's a lot of really cool stuff happening with like car t cells and crispr and all these things and um anyway one of the topics that i started to learn more about was um something called cell reprogramming and you know people maybe have heard of this induced pluripotent stem cells where you could take like a skin cell and turn it back into a stem cell and um shinya yamanaka won the nobel prize for this work that was done in 2006 and um you know it's kind of a crazy thing you can turn one cell into another another type of cell well people recently have been experimenting with um different types of transcription factors that ",
        "135": "would either not you don't want the cell to go all the way back to being a stem cell um you can end up getting like cancerous cells and things like that but you want it basically to the cell to revert a little bit um earlier in its you know it would call it the waddington landscape but it's basically like um go become act start to act like a bit of a younger cell but not to to de-differentiate and become more like a stem cell and so i decided this might be an interesting area to go fund i think that that team has come together there's like some really talented people who've come together to help get that off the ground and they're basically building a a platform that can test a lot of different transcription factors on different cell types and hopefully find ways to rejuvenate different types of cells and tissues to extend human health span i mean the moonshot goal here you know the get to mars is um that there could be some therapy here that in i don't know 10 or 20 years that you take and from a whole body point of view um it's sort of rejuvenating tissue not just one type of tissue like your immune system but ",
