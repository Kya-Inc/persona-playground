        "1": "doing it's it's a little past 6 p.m uh where we are in san francisco uh we wanted to do an east coast friendly show thanks to our guest tonight so thanks so much for uh changing around your schedule i think we got people from like you know somewhere in europe in new zealand just people waking up at like really odd hours thanks for making it all happen and just being here um we really really appreciate it we it was sherman we have a two-year-old kid so we try and work around the schedule this is kind of something we do as a hobby but welcome everyone if you're the first time you're coming to the show welcome to good time shira awesome uh thanks so much charity okay we have some really amazing guests today so let me kind of get them all uh first up you know we have uh gary tan uh you know uh music uh responsible music on the show and uh you know uh vc at initialized capital um and also youtube content creator so go check him out uh smash all the buttons on his youtube channel um we also have coming back uh two of my favorite people on youtube uh in colin and samir uh you know you know i would say you ",
        "2": "know i found you know i met them a few months ago and this has been so inspiring to me and how warm and generous they are both in pers personally but also with the content just helping people think about the creator economy so if you haven't checked them out go check out their youtube content that podcasts are some of the two smartest nicest people that you'll see online so colin samir thank you so much for coming back on the show man thank you your introductions are always uh so great i know my dad's listening and he loves your introduction so thank you guys well if your dad is listening just be sure that your son is achieved more than any other asian kid would ever have so uh i can keep going but i want to impress somebody but um okay we also have coming back somebody really special uh the founder and ceo of a little known company called coinbase uh brian armstrong right thank you so much for coming back thank you for having me i got it there we go uh and uh last but definitely not least ",
        "3": "uh you know this is someone someone that uh i've looked up to for many many years uh um and we are very very lucky to have with us today uh uh marcus brownlee but as everybody probably knows him mkbhd uh you know i can give you some stats uh he has over 13.6 million subscribers on youtube over 700 million views uh last year he has been uploading videos i've been to first several videos since about 2009 uh which in all i think like a 17-inch hp pavilion laptop uh he has uh interviewed actually a couple of folks we have had on the show uh in elon musk and mark zuckerberg and a bunch of others made forbes 30 under 30. but i don't think any of that captures the impact uh marcus has i don't think it's an exaggeration to say that he's by far one of the most influential thoughtful technology commentators and reviewers that you'll ever find um i watch all of his videos and uh he's ",
        "4": "just an amazing amazing uh content creator and technology spokesperson so marcus thank you so much for coming on the show wow you were right about the intros that was incredible thank you thank you for having me on long time listener first time caller looking forward i really enjoy a lot of the conversations i've heard on in the show so far so looking forward to it awesome so okay so we have a lot to cover with marcus and we also have brian on the second part of the show uh you know we're going to talk about how marcus and brian talk uh crypto as well but first off uh marcus i think you know a lot of people here know you but some people will be new to you and i think your story of how you got into youtube i refer to you know you uh having you know uploaded videos for a very long time could you just talk about how we got into uh you know youtube content creation as a teenager and just your journey so far yeah sure i'll give like a like abbreviated version so i started in 2009 in high school and uh high school kid looking for a laptop to spend his uh allowance money on so i want to do all the research i ",
        "5": "possibly could because there's no way i've spent all this money and don't get the best thing so i watched a ton of youtube videos basically um all these reviews all these laptops that were at the time finally got one and ended up buying it and when i got it i noticed some things about it that i actually didn't see in the videos i'd watching i thought i thought i knew everything so i that point was like i sort of felt natural to turn the camera on myself and make a video showing some of those things that i'd found so if someone else is watching a bunch of videos trying to pick a laptop they would have even more information that i didn't have they could make a better choice so that was the first video that's how it started basically with the tech stuff and it's been uh pretty much snowballing ever since but i would say that massively undersells the the the amount of work that you have done over there marcus um uh so so one thing i want to get to is uh you know like could you just walk us through because i think we all ",
        "6": "see the finished product that you have out there um could you just walk us through just your process like when you get like a new gadget for example i just saw your uh you know uh airports max uh you know which we just got i've seen intestines could you just walk us through your process about putting together one of those videos and what that looks like behind the scenes yeah okay so the the videos obviously started off super simple just like turning on the laptop recording with the webcam hitting stop and then i'd upload that file like that was it um so today the videos are very different they're much more well produced and well made just in an effort to make them more enjoyable to watch so it's a whole production basically uh i i think calling out calling a youtuber a video producer would probably be pretty accurate so for a review for something like a smartphone review which is probably the bread and butter of the channel that is a whole process first of all pre-production which is we we forget the device we review it i look through it find out all the things i like about it all the things i don't like about it put it all ",
        "7": "together but then it sort of turns into this this production process where my team and i sort of try to capture on video all of the things that i noticed all the things that i want to include in the review sort of standard i have a script that i share with everyone so we all know what to get video of and uh you know that's that's probably the most fun part of the process because we like to have fun with it we get get carried away with like really you know extra shots robot shots all sort of fun stuff like that and but at the end of the day we try to cover the whole thing and then i just go back and edit it all and turn it into something that i hope people would want to watch uh that's that's actually at this point maybe the most efficient part of the process now you know i did a bunch of prep for this uh in a conversation and you know i was going through some of the interviews and videos and something you said in your recent verge interview stuck with me which is i think you're kind of surprised by how many people are actually ",
        "8": "interested in technology and i guess this may be a kind of like a simple question which we only have a complex answer why do you think your content resonates so broadly because you know in some ways you know i feel like you also been taken by surprise by how many people just kind of it just resonates with and just watching you review these gadgets so what do you think about your content and what you do you know just pulls in so many fans yeah you know when i started tech tech videos wasn't that big of a genre on youtube so i guess part of it comes from just the fact that there's more people watching videos online and obviously as some subset of them are interested in tech so that's awesome but yeah it's just it's wild that like you know a smartphone comes out maybe a pretty niche product gets released i'll make a video talking about what it is and by the end of the day three million people have watched it it just doesn't it doesn't make sense based on what i started with which was you know the early days of youtube in 2009 so it's ",
        "9": "it does always kind of surprise me but uh i think the fact that we have so much fun with it and that we're making stuff we want to watch just means there's other people out there with kind of the same taste that's pretty sweet i wanted to ask you about um sort of the level of quality that you've really brought to the videos over the years and now you have a motion graphics artist you have a cinematographer and i've heard you say that you know that your team might end up spending something like even eight hours of you know sort of creative work on something as little as even like the first seven seconds of intros and things like that and uh i just wanted to like ask about you know has that evolved is it still sort of that level of detail and focus and you know i think hats off because it really does come out in the videos that there is that sort of craftsmanship yeah definitely so this is this is one of the things that's been really interesting about the tech youtube world for the past couple years is like the production value of everything i've seen has skyrocketed so if you if you ",
        "10": "try to upload like the first few videos that i uploaded back in the day they wouldn't get nearly the same response because the the bar for like how good everyone has gotten with video has gone up so much um we've been a big part of that and i'm really proud of that but i think the cherry on top is we try to do things that are sort of next level like really hard to replicate things that take a lot of time but things that are like worth it in the end when you see the final result uh and so that might be yeah that might be spending like seven hours on like a robot shot with some motion graphics and just a crazy intro that like really captivates the whole point of the video it's totally unnecessary but as a as a video nerd it's like because we have the resources and because it's that fun and fun to watch we we find it's actually worth it oh we notice we know i mean especially the camera nerds uh you know on here yeah we noticed it's really appreciated yeah gary and i were just chatting about it ",
        "11": "on like you know how you you were the ones who like i think uh marcus you pioneered like using some really high-end cameras like red cameras and stuff like that which is like it's not a thing it's not what like normal like youtube you know reviewers actually started using you kind of started that whole thing and i guess one one thing i wanted to ask you is like you know back when you started investing in some really high end gear like camera gear they you know did you know at that point like there was going to be payoff and now in retrospect do you feel like there is that payoff of like having really high in gear because i'm sure at that time it was a huge investment it's not easy to make the decision how do you feel about that in retrospect yeah that's a really interesting question so i i i got asked in another sort of interview setting like how do you think about the cost that you spend on a video versus how much you make outputting videos and the fact is i don't really think in individual projects that way where ",
        "12": "like if we buy a camera then i have to like make a certain number of videos to make it worth it um the camera stuff is like it's a little more intangible at a high level because like okay you guys are you know you're very perceptive and you pick up on the difference between like 17 stops of dynamic range from a red camera and 13 but like you can make a tech video amazing with way less equipment i think at the the very highest level that we try to output it's uh it's more of just like the final one percent that when you do notice you do really appreciate that's like it's hard to put into like a dollar value of like we spent this much on the camera and it will be worth it after x videos uh yeah we just never really thought about it that way it's more of just like the the intangibles which maybe that's a bad answer for the business people but that's great think about it that way because not a lot of people do i think a lot of people look at it as like you know it's like a transactional value thing and not to be cynical about it but i think you know a lot of people look at it as roi and like tactical roi ",
        "13": "and it's it's amazing that you don't see it that way marquez something i'd love to touch on is something you guys spoke about earlier today which is you know your journey has been so long on youtube and your rise has been really steady but really significant and like in the beginning you're creating at a time when there aren't even that many other options for video on the internet so you're uploading tons of videos taking tons of shots on youtube but now you're at a point where your youtube videos are very specific and they're reaching millions do you feel like there is more weight every time you press publish like the like the publish button is a little bit heavier now knowing your responsibility and just your your reach yeah and i i think that comes from the response that we we kind of get to videos where like originally the response to a pretty classic like tutorial on that hp laptop was like oh ",
        "14": "neat i learned about some software but the the response sometimes to a bigger video let's say it's a review or maybe it's even something that's like it has a lot of negative points in a review a lot of times you're you're already anticipating what the response will be before you even publish it so there'll be a review where you're you already know there's like a bunch of bad things about this product and hopefully there's you know hopefully i didn't miss anything hopefully the stuff i'm noticing isn't a bug and everyone else's is fine like you start to think more about that sort of stuff and making sure you get it right but i think that's an appropriate pressure i think the with great power comes great responsibility so makes sense and i think uh marquez on that same note you know again something that we kind of touched on a bit earlier today was with that pressure um and that responsibility one thing that you've done really successfully is actually bring the youtube creator ecosystem into the mainstream limelight by bringing more mainstream ",
        "15": "celebrities onto youtube specifically onto your channel um obviously i think you know interviewing kobe bryant is such a big moment not only for you but for the the youtube creator ecosystem elon musk president obama just curious how you look at some of these interviews and specifically maybe the story about uh interviewing kobe bryant and what that was like yeah well i mean first of all i love that i feel like the the rising tide lifts all ships i feel like that's that's been true for a long time so people people open doors for me and i'm happy to hopefully continue to rise the tide and open doors for others um the kobe interview story is so funny because like that's literally uh as a child the second interview i ever did on camera the first one was uh was a virtual interview so i was that's like the most nervous i've ever been in my life which is like nike reaches out to a to a 16 year old and says hey you know this guy kobe bryant he's doing this uh this farewell tour right now you might have heard of him he's dropping a new shoe he had a big ",
        "16": "hand in making it there's all sorts of tech in the shoe he wants to talk about it do you want to talk to him about it and make a video uh yeah so uh i'm not necessarily thinking in the moment like okay this is going to be great for youtube and and people are going to have way more doors open for them in the future um but you know when we hit publish and we see that we did a good job with it i think that that is a pretty sweet byproduct is there's going to be more of that stuff happening um you know so one thing i think about uh you is and i think of people like walt mossberg or previous uh you know folks have been like really legend in the tech reviewing scene so over the years i would say you know you went from like somebody on youtube to know probably one of the most influential voices when it comes to the green technology products and my career and artie's career has often been the other side we often been the people making products if not hardware definitely software how do you think of the evolution of your relationship with these companies do they ask you for feedback are they a frenemy do you give them ",
        "17": "input are they afraid of you how do you see that evolution in your relationship with you know apple or tesla or anybody else for that matter yeah it's funny i think i think it's a healthy respect now the thing about if you're in if you're in youtube for long enough in like the product review scene i'm sure if you asked like a makeup youtuber or any sort of product reviewer they'd find the same thing there is always some level of marketing happening no matter who you speak to or when you speak to them uh when it comes to a product so everyone's trying to be honest about a new product when it comes out and i love that um but we obviously have a tendency to be brutally honest that's the whole point of the channel so if they're looking me in the eyes and trying to spin a negative as a positive it's kind of like we're looking at each other and i know you're saying that you think it's the best option but i think we both know that there's things you could have done better here uh something that comes to mind i'm giving a super specific example but when i asked about samsung's new ",
        "18": "thousand dollar note 10 or note20 and why it was made of plastic and they called it glastic because it kind of seems like glass like i'm looking at the guy and he's telling me this and i think you kind of see like a a look in his eye where he's like yeah i know i'm telling you this and i already know that you know that this is kind of dumb but i think i think that relationship is like very common in the tech in the tech world where you're you're trying to you're trying to see through the fog all the time and obviously it's their job to promote the product as best as they can but it's my job to uh to share the the real experience with people so that's what i try to do that's great i mean i think at some point you call yourself a professional user and uh you know that it just makes a lot of sense because oftentimes like you said we you know ibuild products and until recently was like tech companies just building products and this is kind of our life right like we get so caught up in the details of like how we built stuff in teams and everything that we don't look at it all ",
        "19": "you know pretty much like how you see it which is like totally fresh pair of eyes as like an external user so that's really interesting um i think one question i wanted to ask you this is like slightly separate um you know what i i love your videos on retro tech um and uh especially you know i'm sure like one of the most watched ones is the gameboy one i'm sure you get asked about that all the time uh you know i would love to understand the inspiration behind it like it's just such a cool idea it's really fun the gameplay one particularly i i find it really funny because you know you start out with like this thing came out in like 1989 and you know i wouldn't really know about it i wasn't a user and we were like yeah no  like we get that and you kind of like go from there into like you know getting casey and just going like having a lot of fun with it so talk to us about like the inspiration behind retro tech that sort of videos in general uh and also like if you can go into specifics of any of these or like the gameboy one specifically on like behind the scenes there or how you made it happen yeah retro tech's a good one it's so it ",
        "20": "was a lot of good things coming together in the same place um i happen to be 27 so i'm like right in this age where there's a bunch of pretty iconic pieces of tech that i barely missed like i never owned a gamecube but i just thank you for making us all feel really ancient right there thank you so much for that but like it mattered a lot because there's a lot of people in different ages in my audience too where they are way more familiar with these pieces of tech so i'm always talking about this new stuff new new new all the newest pieces of tech and the the thought came up of like there's there's like a whole list of things that i could sort of review now and review their impact on tech as we have it today uh and sort of rediscover that stuff so yeah we we had a bunch of youtubers appear on the show and it was a lot of fun um and i got to sort of rediscover that that nostalgic bit of tech and i think people who are older who did use that tech found it in a totally ",
        "21": "different light where it was like oh i i i played with this i i knew it like the back of my hand so it's a different lens to view it through but i think both versions of watching that show would be really cool yeah i love that you tried to open the whole box and you were like how what how do i do that and and there was like a small like push or something written there and you were like man okay i feel like they've really improved the packaging technology since then years ago to now boxes have gotten a lot better since since that since the late 80s so you you uh marquez like on this on this topic of you because being like a professional user and and someone who's like very into tech obviously plays out in in the videos and it's why you've built such a big community but another thing that you are is a professional youtube creator and that's not something that was actually you know available when you first started uploading videos so just to shift focus and into that direction you're pretty transparent with how the business of youtube works uh especially ",
        "22": "your business between you know adsense uh brand deals merchandise uh some of the different you know diverse revenue streams that you have but what do you think goes into being a professional youtube creator like what what are the components that make up a professional youtube creator i'm sure there's a lot of people in the audience who are interested in becoming that so just curious you you mentioned you have this great analogy about an octopus so i'll just leave it there yeah yeah okay so so there's a bunch of first of all it's always funny when you ask like a kid in maybe i don't know sixth grade or something today like what do you want to do when you grow up and so many of them say youtuber today but that literally didn't exist 10 years ago which is hilarious um so today so if you want to be a youtuber so let's say you're in sixth grade or whatever grade and going to be a youtuber you you end up having maybe like six or seven different individual jobs that you have to train yourself in and become good at at the same time ",
        "23": "so i'd describe myself as an octopus like you have these eight arms doing eight different things one of those arms is writing video ideas one of those arms is being a camera operator one of those arms is being a professional video editor one of those arms is being a content strategist and figuring out how to use social media in different ways to grow your brand one of them is literally just in charge of the inbox one of them is a financial accountant who talks to the tax attacks man like there's a lot going on when you're uh when you're a professional youtuber it's a small title that includes a bunch of different stuff i could go way more into the octopus thing but depends on how much time we have uh we have a bunch of time actually but you know actually one of the things uh uh you know it's kind of related to that by the way marcus i love your joke in one of your interviews about this is probably the most common question you get around the you know the holiday dinner table any dinner table which is like how do i make money of youtube um do you remember like was there a video or was there a moment where you were like okay you know what this is going to be ",
        "24": "my thing this is going to be my career because in some ways i feel like a lot of people like you know um maybe don't realize how long you've been doing this and this is like not an overnight success so like did you ever have more be like okay you know what this is you know going to be you know what i'm going to do and uh nothing else yeah okay so i wish i could point to like one moment where i went oh i uploaded this video and then i knew uh but it's not really as romantic as that i think really if you picture a gradient of like i don't know just imagine a band that's blue on one side and red on the other side and it's just the sort of a clean gradient from blue to red at some point in there it's not blue anymore and it's it's red but it's kind of unclear where that point is and that's kind of how it feels going from doing it as a hobby to doing it as a job uh i think the obvious answer is when i graduated from college then like i i needed a job and it was just where i would pour all my time and reinvest um but i think yeah at some point during college it was like when a professor ",
        "25": "asks you why you haven't dropped out yet and then why classmates are like wondering why all of your projects have something to do with youtube but you never tell anyone about it it's kind of it just sort of happens slowly so that's uh that's how i look at it mark has other questions i mentioned that my dad is in the audience and my dad is someone i've tried to explain the business of youtube um to a few times and i'm not very successful at it so i was curious if there are people listening who don't fully 100 understand how the business of youtube works how do you explain it hold on before you answer that mark yes uh some means that just know that samir and has been inspiring millions of us and and you know he's been such a huge impact on my channel um and you should be really proud of him and he just really made it in a way that i appreciate that thank you marcus yeah that's so good um okay so yeah youtube is it's a platform it's i mean i don't know ",
        "26": "if i could just exp i'm just gonna give you like the fundamentals of it but basically when youtube sells ads they split it with the people who uploaded the content like it's that simple uh the more eyeballs and the more specific eyeballs you bring to youtube uh the more revenue you generate for youtube and therefore the more they split with you and there's a trillion other nuances to that that are you know cpm related and content related and audience funnel related and all that fun stuff but at the end of the day youtube wants people on their platform and even outside of you know the advertising obviously that that comes through youtube which is very unique to being a youtube creator um you're even you mentioned this in a couple other interviews you're also fielding you know brand deals that are straight into your inbox can you talk a bit about how you think about working with brands and operating your business as a creator because obviously one of those octopus arms for you is is not just creating the videos but actually selling ",
        "27": "um brand integrations 100 so at a pretty core level like brands are reaching out to creators because they can more specifically target you know an audience of a certain topic and so every time i get you know i do manage my inbox and i'm in charge of the brand deals that i take and most of that is about finding good partners to work with who really are like actually willing to embrace working with the creator which to me means letting a creator be creative and actually you know deliver a message as best they can to the audience that they know better than anyone else um but the other half of that job is saying no to almost everything saying no to 99 point something percent of the things i'm offered because either they're not a great fit or they're not the best partner to work with um it is it's kind of a balancing act you juggle a lot of things there but i think at the end of the day i just i'm still trying to make things that people want to watch so always good to keep that in the back of the head by the way we really ",
