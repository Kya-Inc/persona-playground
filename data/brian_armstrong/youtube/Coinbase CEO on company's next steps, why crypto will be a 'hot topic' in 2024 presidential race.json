        "0": "well regulation around crypto has been making headlines lately with the SEC filing lawsuits against the several big names in the space from Ripple labs to FTX and it's having significant impacts on crypto Investments it might be why some crypto exchanges start searching for more regulatory Clarity around the globe at least that's what coinbase chairman and CEO Brian Armstrong told our executive editor Brian sozy at the Goldman Sachs communicopia and Tech conference take a listen well I think stable coins are a really important stepping stone you know so in crypto writ large it's the most important technology out there to update the financial system right we've seen that at 67 of Americans think that the financial system is in need of a major update crypto is the best opportunity to do that so yes we're going to have decentralized cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin uh we're going to have things like ethereum that are building new application platforms on top that are totally decentralized but if we need to get people you know sometimes you have to meet people where they are right and so if they want to use US dollars for now um that's great we have now US Dollars running on crypto rails that are more ",
        "1": "efficient more globally allow you to do cross-border transactions or send small amounts to people no matter what country they're in so um these things are all going to help the crypto ecosystem grow and get to that decentralized Vision I think you put out a tweet recently I really liked it you you said bear market so the best time for building so what else are you building at coinbase yeah why should an investor expect to come up on the platform a year from it yeah well I don't want to pre-announce anything here but a couple big ones we've talked about recently so we launched base which is our layer 2 Solution that's helping blockchains scale we need to get the the costs down the confirmation times down to be really competitive and you know payments flow to the path of least resistance the less friction you can make the more the more payments there will be we've also been investing a lot in our derivatives platform so you know I mentioned that internationally both and then in the US as well so we'll keep pushing you on a few of those I also put out a blog post talking about some of like the future ideas on the horizon and a number of uh you know our Venture Investments might go into things like that but I talked about flat coins which ",
        "2": "is kind of the next iteration of stable coins that's more maybe linked to CPI or purchasing power I talked about flat coin yeah flat coin is where is that is that just only down developing I've never heard of flat Quinn yeah it's a new thing on the horizon uh there's a couple teams working on it uh we're not building something in that realm yet but we're interested in it and you know how could decentralized reputation protocols work or um you know in online games people now want to own their in-game items and like you know how could Network States be governed and you know so there's lots of cool ideas I put out a blog post and tweet about that too where is coinbase at in terms of trading volumes are you seeing that improve at all well um it's come down a bit I would say since obviously the 2021 highs and things like that but we're not on we're not like unused to these these Cycles right so um we see when prices go up obviously more retail interest what's interesting in this down Market is that we've actually seen there's been a kind of a flight to Quality so we are seeing more institutions come in and sign up go through our onboarding process and ",
        "3": "they're not necessarily moving huge amounts of capital in yet but they are they are on onboarding and waiting and seeing say okay what's that trigger for them maybe it's maybe it's the blockchains become more scalable maybe some regulatory Clarity maybe a court case happens and I think we'll start to see um different amounts of capital actually come in at that point when does regulation come what does that even look like well it's already happening in the world writ large you know I mentioned you know Europe um the UK Australia Canada Brazil these regions UAE have all been actually very forward thinking 83 of the G20 countries now have this crypto legislation either already in place or in progress um it's really sorry I don't know if you're asking just about the us but in the US I think it'll happen in the U.S yeah it'll happen in one of a few ways so one way is the courts the courts can can be the one to provide the clarity regardless of the outcome of the case it creating case law is a way to get there if The Regulators aren't going to provide it another way to do it is through Congress right Congress is very engaged in this now passing uh it ",
        "4": "looking at this fit 21 bill that's um which just got bipartisan approval in the house the stablecoin market structure Bill uh also got bipartisan approval in the house so we'll see how that makes its way through the Senate and the executive branch um the cftc could step up and assert more Authority I also think you know there's a possibility we'll just get a different sec share in 2024 or or Beyond so um some we'll try all these things in parallel somehow one will come through before I let you go I don't think investors realize how much time you do spend talking to regulators and other politicians what is that like that that did you expect that when you founded coinbase um well the role of a CEO is always evolving to what's the most important thing right so I started the company really as an engineer just typing on my laptop um and built the initial version of the app and then you know as something grows it starts to have a really important uh role to play in society and so yeah you start to engage with governments um world leaders Banks and we're at that ",
        "5": "phase now where we need to make sure that we are an educational resource that we actually bring the crypto Community together to make sure our voice is heard and there's these great websites like stand with crypto.org which are helping the crypto industry come together and say hey look 56 roughly a million Americans have used crypto now it's 5x as many as have electric vehicles just as an example and we're voters we we want to donate to candidates that are supporting crypto we want to show up at Town Halls I don't think everybody in DC actually fully realize how powerful realizes how powerful the crypto voting Community block is and I think 2024 is an election where you know the voters of America are really going to hold candidates speech of the fire and say what is your position on crypto are you going to be a continuation of these existing policies that have been unnecessarily hostile or are you going to allow this technology to flourish and ensure America's leadership as a technology Hub do you see certain folks out there in the political sphere as friendly any candidates that you say wow they get elected my job might become a hell of a lot easier ",
        "6": "um yeah so I mean I I don't want to come out and personally endorse anybody but yes if you look at the the presidential candidates that are in the running today they're talking about crypto and so far as far as I can tell all of their comments have been positive they see it as an opportunity to challenge um the the policies that the current Administration has had in Downstream effects with The Regulators that they they view as not in line with what the American people want and so I think this could become a Hot Topic in the presidential race in 2024 "
