        "0": "yeah so i would say you know short term it was quite a painful transition i think it created a lot of consternation there was you know some folks in the media decided to go call a bunch of people who had left the company and you know write hit pieces and all that kind of thing and frankly you know about five percent of the company opted into the exit taxes package so there was some teams that were short-handed a lot of people had to work extra time to fill in the gaps but long term i think it turned out to be an incredibly positive decision for the company i do think there's a lot of companies in silicon valley right now and probably elsewhere is that you know the ceos and the management team almost feel like they're being held hostage by employees and i feel for some of these organizations you know sundar probably has an incredibly difficult job right now we saw that that video from microsoft i think last year with with satya and kind of was with people talking about their hair color and stuff and they don't feel like that they can really lean in and move the company in the direction they want and they're they're fearful of kind of all these internal dynamics so you know i think there's probably a better way to do it than what i did which is if you're starting a company today just make that clear up front i ",
        "1": "didn't make it clear up front and so the company culture started to diverge and drift and i had to kind of realign it which was which was a painful process if i was doing it over again i'd probably just set that as the expectation up front and then it wouldn't be this you know public awkward realignment but yeah i think i'm i'm really glad that i did it i think coinbase has been very productive since then and we've been able to attract a lot of the best and brightest people from some of these other companies that are like i don't want to be in those companies anymore i want to work at a company where we just focus on the work and the mission because that's actually important so i'd say it's been positive yeah so i think you know ben horowitz always talked about like wartime ceo peacetime ceo and frankly you know i'm kind of a conflict avoidant person right i never thought of myself as like wartime ceo we're just like we're all going in this direction let's go go go you know i never really thought of myself like that but i think what i'm trying to do now is find the happy medium between these two so you the company should have a really ambitious mission and then i think you as the ceo you do have to say no to things but you're off track from that you do have to part ways with people who ",
        "2": "are not helping raise the talent bar in the company and so in some ways you have to be i guess hard in that sense but i don't think it's it's not like you know we're all in here to make money and it's like it's bonus time or you're out or whatever it's like we actually have a much softer culture than that i think in silicon valley which is most of the missions of these companies are trying to do great humanitarian efforts and they're trying to improve the biggest problems in the world and so people sign up for those because they want to have a real impact and you know we take time to like go for exec off sites and we walk in nature and you know we have like coaching we do all this touchy-feely stuff so i think it's kind of a mix of both is the right balance i don't think of myself as like you know a wall street hedge fund or like the most touchy-feely culture you can imagine yeah i mean one theory i have on this is that in silicon valley especially pre-pandemic we were all it was so competitive to get talent right you know google and facebook they were just kind of one-upping each other on like higher and higher salaries and so i i know as a ceo of a company that was rising at that time i felt incredible ",
        "3": "scarcity like i had people leave to get out who got better offers and it was like a real issue and so i was doing anything i could to retain people and keep them and so if if an employee said hey i want you know another flavor of water in the kitchen or whatever i was like okay maybe we should do it right but i think you know during the pandemic we removed we moved to remote first as a culture the the talent like the talent we could get opened up by 100x of people all over the world who were really hungry and like frankly thankful for these jobs and that actually changed the scarcity mindset a little bit to say hey you know if you don't want to be here that's fine we can we have other people we can go recruit and hire in who really are going to value it that's probably just one piece of it it's a much more complex issue than that i think one other one other thing is that you know like google and facebook i think kind of made this a common trend in the valley where companies would host these open mic q and a's on every friday or every two weeks or whatever and it was almost like a town hall it felt like a democracy right and in a democracy like the leader you know ",
        "4": "works for the people they're elected by the people um but what got very awkward was that these open mic q and a's it became you know this kind of like hostile thing of like how can we make the person squirm and let's ask them these difficult societal issue questions that aren't actually related to the company and what we're all building and you know i think that was actually a mistake in silicon valley we've since gotten rid of these open mic q as because it really encourages people i'd say one we were like 150 200 people everyone was on the same page everyone was asking good questions once we got to like 500 700 people it started to feel like there was a little bit of an us versus them and then you know the questions got very off track and i realized at a certain point this is not a democracy i watch everyone's input i'm not going to rule like with an iron fist but ultimately you know i'm the ceo i need to help guide this company in one direction and force the hard decisions not everyone's going to like them so we're not going to allow people to do grand standing open mic stuff there's just a little bit of a risk for that you know 99 of people don't do it but if one person does it and it kind of creates the snowball effect so we got rid of the ",
        "5": "open mics people can still submit questions but they're there nobody else can see them we read them ahead of the q a and if there's a good theme in the questions we address it but you can't like grandstand with an open mind social media once you get more than i don't know 500 people in a room or a thousand people a lot of ceos i've been talking to we're all trying to figure this out because we still think slack is a net positive to productivity but it has a huge negative in terms of both distracting people with lots of things popping up all the time but also these kind of social media flame wars that emerge and mob like behavior so some of the things i mean we've been trying is for instance if we get any kind of a slack room that has say more than 500 or thousand people will often try to limit it so only you know you can you have to be a vp or level 9 and above you can only post in there and other otherwise it's read only so we're trying to you know dunbar's number is 150 people right you're trying to think who who can you remember everyone's name and have some sort of group affinity with them and any too much above dunbar's number we try to like cap it so it's it's a read-only chat room but i think these tools need to keep evolving and i hope some i know there's a couple ",
        "6": "startups you all might have funded some of them um that are working on this you me you're making me think of dowels and things like that but i think a lot of that is kind of unproven like daos are probably good ways to get um new kind of governance systems in place for allocating capital or maybe even managing a city or or a society but you know i kind of agree with david i think the best way to affect change right now today is for young people is start a company or join a company i think young people are sometimes a little enamored with like becoming an activist but i think fundamentally that's you're sort of giving up your power by saying like well they have the power and i don't and so i'm going to speak truth to power but i think you know some there's context for that historically whether that may have been more true but i think today a lot of people they have more power than they realize and if you go start a company which by the way companies are decentralized too you can have lots of little companies all over the world um they're not like you know monolithic usually and so if they start a company they can have a good impact i think on the biggest issues out there "
