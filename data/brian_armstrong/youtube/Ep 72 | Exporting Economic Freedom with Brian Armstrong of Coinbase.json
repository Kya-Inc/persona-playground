        "0": "foreign [Music] Jeremy Lair and welcome to this episode of the money movement I'm here in Singapore for the Singapore fintech festival and I'm really thrilled to be joined today by coinbase founder Brian Armstrong welcome thanks for having me Jeremy app yeah this is awesome uh we don't get to be together in person very often and being able to do it all the way around the world here is kind of cool I agree we do almost all of our meetings over video but this is like I was joking people this is the highest resolution video call we're gonna do for a while yeah it is it is it's really good um obviously there's just like tons we can talk about and themes um I think um you know I I actually want to start with just like a very high level theme which is like kind of moving from the speculative value phase to the utility value phase of crypto and I actually remember um I think it was I don't know if it was after your series b or one of your after your fundraising you like had like a a ",
        "1": "document you published which was I think kind of like hear these different phases and where our secret master plan the secret master plan that's right yes yeah we're wearing these phases you don't necessarily have to reference that particular thing but I think like right now is a really interesting moment because like so much infrastructure has been built there's just so much there you know stepping back 10 years right I think as we look and say wow look how far this has come it's amazing but we're still like really early and and we we have maybe a few hundred million people who are touching this is still a small part of the world obviously we all believe it's going to be everyone in the world eventually but what do you think are the most important things most important problems to be solving for kind of moving to more utility value in crypto today yeah well you're right so we always kind of thought about it as crypto going through these three phases of it would start off as primarily an investment use case and then it would move to you know ",
        "2": "different types of financial services borrowing and lending and remittance and earning money and commerce and then it would move to not even non-financial service things like you know web3 and the decentralized apps and we're seeing that now with decentralized identity and social and gaming and you know all these Dows new types of things experiments and all these things yeah yeah so I mean I think the things that that'll the big unlocks to help that happen even faster I mean it's already happening today as as you've mentioned and we we actually track some of that internally at coinbase like what percent of our active users are doing something other than trading and it's now more than 50 right and it's not just one thing that they're doing it's like a bunch of little things right it's they're using like their coinbase card and coinbase are you know they're earning money with crypto doing peer-to-peer payments like Commerce right so staking and yield and all these things have become bigger and bigger so we're seeing that transition already happen it's more than 50 of our active users and I think the way we get it to be even bigger over the next big unlocks I mean one of them it's got to be regulatory Clarity right that's one I know you've worked super hard on all ",
        "3": "over the world um and if we can a lot of the institutional investors I talk to for instance they all say you know we've got one percent of our portfolio in crypto and I say what would it take to get it to 20 or 30 and they say regulatory Clarity regulatory Clarity yeah it's all I mean the whole ball game is regulatory Clarity and so we can come back to that theme obviously that's a big theme yeah yeah and um so that's a big one and then the other one is you know scalability the blockchains totally um depends who you talk to some people feel like the blockchains are scalable now we need the apps yeah yeah or it's like um when the internet first got going and had all this fiber optic infrastructure and anyway I I feel like getting another order of magnitude of scalability in the blockchains would just unlock all these use cases I use the example of sorry to interrupt like the example of like we're going from dialogue to broadband yeah and like you know yes like these third generation chains that are kind of out there now right they have X thousand TPS Etc but when you think about like web3 and the kinds of apps and the kinds of things that people want to do like we don't have the pipes right and I think ",
        "4": "Broadband is an interesting analogy because it is about throughput basically again at the end of the day and how many bits you can move but this is sort of about kind of how much kind of shared State can exist on these compute platforms and and um but uh we're still like you know like when Broadband came right it was originally just you know DSL I was like not really it was like five times faster than a dial-up modem yeah um and then eventually yeah enough got there where almost any app could kind of happen over that yeah but sorry that was like one infrastructure of scaling yes yeah totally yeah yeah to me those are the two big ones and um I mean I don't know if I had to pick a third one it's probably just the usability right like right now today with with web3 and all these use cases the typical it's actually amazing how much adoption web thing has gotten given how difficult it is to use but a lot of times people will they'll buy crypto on an exchange then they'll move it to a self-custodial wallet which is often a Chrome extension right right there you've lost you know ",
        "5": "most of them and you think about the funnel right yeah most people in the world don't use Chrome extensions except nerds like us right and then you know you've got to figure out how to connect your wallet yes you might lose you might lose the funds um there's all these you know oftentimes you have to like Bridge your funds to another layer too and so we've just got to make it way way simpler so the usability yeah I think you know it's got to just be like you want to buy that you click a buy button and it all magically Works somehow like a lot a lot of a lot of people often say like you know crypto reaches mainstream when people don't know they're using crypto right yeah like and I think not exactly sure what that means but but clearly like that user experienced Slayer I agree about that it's it's it's a it's it's such a huge hurdle um for people and uh you know going back to like early examples of iterations on on the internet right my last company was digital media and you know like media was like browser plugins it was like you wanted to stream a video you had to go get either the ",
        "6": "Windows Media Player or the real player or the QuickTime Player and it was like all these different codecs and they're constantly upgrading and it's like it was awful it was like truly awful but people were really excited about it and there was actually a lot of streaming but you know you you eventually you needed like you know kind of either common standards that then all the clients could Implement um that then made that work and we're not quite there but maybe we'll get there if Apple and Google and people who control the client operating systems actually build some of the crypto Primitives in into the Roses um that could help yeah that would help yeah yeah and maybe we'll get there on that in the next I don't know a few years yeah I mean that'll be a very interesting question if crypto companies actually need to go build their own Hardware like phones and laptops and VR headsets or if the current generation of of those companies will actually embrace it I think they're all a little bit some you know there's there's people inside all these big companies that are thinking about crypto in a very Pro crypto yeah but sometimes the leadership is ambivalent or it's just not their ",
        "7": "highest priority and so you get kind of waffling and it's it'll be interesting to see if like a dedicated crypto phone can actually um push that whole situation forward yeah definitely we're seeing we're seeing experiments like that if you look at like what apple is doing and Google and others but like yeah they have their wallet and it has like identity and entitlements and they're trying to kind of layer in these other things um that are kind of kind of closed looped to their environment and like you can see like nfts as entitlement mechanisms and crypto Primitives as mechanisms for identity and you know all those could be standardized on open infrastructure and um it's sort of like the the uh pre-internet standards era um you know that that is in some of these spaces but crypto's kind of finding its way and I I I like to think once it's clearly you know a whole set of use cases that go beyond ",
        "8": "um in in say if I'm an Apple product lead like Beyond like this is just about Bitcoin or in people's minds is super simplistic right and and it's actually like this is this is actually important internet infrastructure yeah um yeah so uh one of the things I'm interested to hear your take on is is um like over the medium to long term this sort of shift from um kind of entities that exist uh in the in real life um to kind of entities that exist on chain and it's it's one of the things I'm most excited about in terms of like long-term growth is the idea that labor and capital um Can can construct mechanisms to work together that are truly Global that are transparent uh and you know auditable and kind of can exist entirely on chain Dao's is sort of the word people use for a lot of these but ",
        "9": "not all of these are going to be autonomous nor totally decentralized but let's just call them Dows for now but but like on-chain entities in a sense um and I know you guys have experimented a little bit with with that in terms of stuff out in the ecosystem but interested to hear your take on how significant you think that can be and how much of a growth driver that can be to the kind of crypto economy over the long run yeah well I like how you framed it as better organization of capital and labor um you know we're here in Singapore which is well I'm really passionate about this idea of economic freedom and you know the mission of coinbase is increased economic freedom and so Singapore if you look at the the rankings of the world is actually the number one um highest economic freedom country in the world right now if you look at the 2010 2022 rankings on Wikipedia but based on you know various organizations that rank these things so um that was kind of what made this place so prosperous was um you know property rights and you know rule of law and you know free trade and all these things that allowed capital ",
        "10": "and labor to come together in unison and just make better high quality products at cheaper prices and it just even with very few natural resources they became this incredibly wealthy country so in a way it's like crypto is trying to bring that Prosperity story to more and more countries around the world and I do think dowels are a really big deal they're a huge part of this puzzle yeah I'm I love Dallas I'm super bullish on it I think so it's a very broad term and you know people go through various ups and downs just like in any new innovation in crypto where you know D5 will take off and then it'll have a winter or whatever so Dows have kind of gone through some of these as well you know look the bugs need to get worked out in the smart contracts um it'd be nice if we had better Tools around you know anybody could sort of go and create a Dao um you know manage to do governance through voting and all this stuff should get super yeah simple functions of an organization and make that more like a SAS product but all executed safely on yeah on chain yeah even even like payroll in people so there's another weird thing which I think people need to ",
        "11": "figure out what Dallas and I I we probably need to do our part on this too but um some Dows I've seen actually they turn into like collectives yeah um which is almost like you know designed by committee or whatever yeah and I don't think that's the right model right you know companies always are thinking about this too right and in theory you have like flat hierarchy divisions P L's yeah yeah yeah and just I mean generally the standard model is like you have one CEO who can make the call and move forward so you don't have just endless deadlock and debate and everything but you know maybe you have a board that creates governance over that and like so anyway I think people the good news about Dallas is going to be like a lot of variants in different models that people experiment with so it's not just those are not just one thing yeah um I do think there's some projects that have kind of default made the Dow sort of like um this committee or commune thing and that and that's I think that's probably not going to work yeah yeah but who knows I could be wrong yeah I look at it as like this is the first time you know ",
        "12": "like if you go back to the 1800s and you had joint stock corporations is this sort of thing that gets a common pattern and and then in some ways like Banking and capital markets laddered off of that in some ways and so but now like we have this creative surface of you have an entity and you have participants and you can have contractual uh interactions and economic coordination and all those things can start to happen and it's like a space it's a space for radical experimentation right and like I'm I'm interested in in just sort of seeing ideally like a lot of different ways people try and organize these things and and hopefully like there's like a legal binding like so there's enough that like they can pay taxes or or whatever or can connect to labor laws if there are labor laws that they need to connect to but so there's that hybrid kind of thing kind of like a stable coin it's like this real world thing that's connected to an on-chain thing and but I I see I sort of Imagine a lot of ",
        "13": "experimentation and I think um corporate forms like yes there's been a lot of of work on corporate forms but kind of these new Global Internet native corporate forums like it's it's really a new thing um and distributed work and everything else kind of plays into that so I I'm likewise super bullish about it and just you know just curious to hear how you were thinking about it too yeah yeah yeah yeah I'm curious um I mean there's certain jurisdictions I think have tried to lean into this like like Wyoming did something which I think is really smart it could you know like most c-corps in the US are in Delaware so like I feel like Wyoming made this like really smart move and I talked to some um some of the leaders in in uh in Wyoming I was like how did how did that come about and they were like honestly it was this one guy and he had this crazy idea and we all didn't really quite understand it they were like sure try it out and I was like sometimes it's the funniest thing ways that these things happen but I don't know do you have any I'm still trying to think about like I'm curious your thoughts how will you know Dows are ",
        "14": "supposed to handle the court system or whatever is supposed to be handled Unchained and it's we've seen some of them that have resolved that successfully with votes yeah um but what I'm still trying to think about what is the tie-in back to the real world like yeah if you need to go to some Wyoming court or something what's the situation I don't know how do you think about that yeah I mean like I I think like you know clearly um a couple things I mean these entities need to be able to contract with um into other legal entities right so I think that that's a really key thing because that's not it's not gonna be viable that they are it's so self-contained that all products and services are entirely in that on-chain world and so I feel like there is that kind of um root kind of kind of you know connectivity that that has to be there and so you know llc's um or or or other kind of corporate structures can exist and and or can kind of be bound like this I mean Wyoming down is kind of like that but I think other governments are sort of saying hey you can have an on-chain entity that ",
        "15": "that does these things I mean I think the contracts that they enter into that are off-chain contracts then you have dispute resolution through uh through that and then I think there's you know interesting work that can be done in terms of on-chain dispute resolution you know there's like Claris I don't know if you've looked at that which is um kind of a decentralized arbitration system that exists entirely on chain and I mean it's it's fairly early in in its development there was the Aragon court right which attempted to do you know something like this as well so I feel like um those kinds of experiments could continue and you could actually see like durable kind of arbitration mechanisms to to deal with you know what are kind of provable on-chain activities and contracts and things like that that's cool yeah it makes sense you kind of need that maybe in at least in the intermediate stage you need that connectivity back into the the Legacy you know system um of paper and records and whatever to ",
        "16": "sort of interface with non-dow entities yeah but you're right more and more of it could go Unchained with these kind of arbitration courts and stuff that'd be that'd be super cool yeah yeah so it's an interesting one um um maybe we want to Pivot to talk about um uh kind of lending um and and in particular um this sort of concept of um maybe maybe stepping back like I have this Theory and relates to stable coins actually which is the total addressable market for you know stable coins um you know kind of full Reserve type stable coins that we're looking at I think of it as just M2 electronic money so that's like a hundred trillion dollars so it's a big Market um but when you actually break that down like the vast majority of that M2 money is actually um kind of leveraged Capital meaning it's deposits that then are kind of there's a money multiplier and that's the fractional Reserve System that is basically kind of playing out loans on the deposit base and and you know if you ",
        "17": "really want to compete with them to money you have to like create credit intermediation and and so credit intermediation um you know today there's like ways that that happens and and you know we have credit intermediation on chain but it's mostly like leveraged Capital meaning it's margin borrowing and things like that and so I think the really interesting problem becomes when when can on-chain methods provide unsecured forms of credit intermediation or or different levels of security and there's again there's like D5 projects that are square mounting with this today that are interesting um but it kind of gets to this you know ties into daos and like if there's an organization that actually has its treasury on chain well then you can actually see you know a lot about its Financial Health and then you could underwrite it right um and so you know oracleized data is another way to do that right um but I'm just I'm curious as you think about the future of lending on ",
        "18": "blockchains you know what do you think in terms of that kind of the the role that blockchains play in in broader credit facilitation well you know I hadn't thought about it in terms of um the M2 money supply and how that can expand and there may be all I bet you've thought about that actually a lot more than I have so it'd be kind of curious to get your thoughts you know the main thing I've just been thinking about in terms of credit in terms of what these on-chain protocols can unlock and and lending is that today a lot of these lending marketplaces are just so constrained into one country or to one type of person and you know look in inside each of these I'm sure there's like there were reasonable reasons why these things were created but the net effect of it is that um just there's not equal access to credit globally at all right I remember I spent a year living in Argentina and I was kind of surprised to learn there that people can't get mortgages for their house it's just that the credit Market is just not developed there and so the net effect of it is that wealthy ",
        "19": "people who can pay cash for a house like they own hope they own property and then most like 99 of people don't own property they can only rent their whole life right and so it's basically keeping them more in poverty all the you know real estate is a big way that people build their wealth it's the same thing um you know if you wanted to build a Global Lending Marketplace you'd have to go not only to all in all states in the US but all these 200 countries around the world it's sort of silly I mean why why can't um I make a loan to someone in India or rice or in Brazil or whatever it's it's very silly to me so I think that just in terms of human potential and like economic growth and everything a Global Credit Marketplace would completely unlock that and yeah that's part of what D5 is trying to do yeah totally yeah I mean 100 agree um I I uh I often use the concept of of long tail Capital markets and like the the internet's really good at at long tail markets right long tail advertising with you know Google AdWords and long ",

        "21": "people who have needs and um ultimately kind of getting to a place where um you know there's long tail underwriting um in a sense right yeah where you can kind of have that be surfaced to on-chain systems that can provide the right kind of decisioning yeah I mean yeah one thing I've thought about a little bit is just you know now the decentralized identity is becoming bigger with ens and these other protocols um there should be probably some kind of FICO score equivalent for an ens right and especially if you can look at attestations on that account the history of that account what maybe it's received um payroll from from a dow or you you know you and I have sent and you have a reputation it's basically like a Google page rank type algorithm on the on the graph structure of the transactions and um I'm actually I haven't looked into this two deeply but I'm a little surprised we haven't seen like a reputation score FICO score decentralized protocol emerge that's probably something that needs to get built yeah yeah I mean there's definitely um projects that are experimenting with that and and um I think um yeah again this kind of ",

        "23": "um I'd be interested I know you guys have recently done uh uh coinbase ID and builton ens and and sort of you're starting to progress into that and kind of what do you envision um over the next couple years becoming possible at scale all yeah well I'm very excited about ens and and decentralized identity generally not just that standard there's there's a variety of them but so we wanted to make it easy first of all for people to kind of get one for free right so they didn't have to go and buy it so you know if we basically made um you know like jeremy.cb.id or anybody basically claim a username.cb.edu because it because it has kind of um I don't know what you'd call it like a prefix on it yeah um you know we were able to kind of get the cb.id root name or whatever yeah so we wanted to make that easy for anybody to claim but of course people want to have customized names too um and we want to make it possible for them to buy those easily and right now I think they can just transfer it in if they want but yeah um so there's should ",
        "24": "be a Marketplace for those and people should auction them off um and I think there's going to be a variety of you know um decentralized identity standards too and yeah um maybe more we can work on there over time but for sure yeah um I think look that's a very fun foundational piece because today it's for so many reasons today we're sending money to a random string of characters it's like an IP to the ux issue yeah yeah yeah so is it human readable or machine readable it's these are all machine readable right just like IP addresses but then we got domain names right yeah and we got email addresses so that feels like a foundational thing I should be sending it always to a human readable name it should have a like a reputation score a decentralized thing attached to it I should probably be able to go to look at that profile page for that that name maybe even see um you know things that the person wants to be public right ideally you wouldn't want to have everything public right now that's another issue that some private some public but you should be able to go there and see you know maybe post decentralized um social media posts you've made or ",

        "33": "think in crypto and it's not going to allow Singapore to be the financial Hub it deserves to be as this leader in economic freedom um yeah so and I think on self-custodial while it's like just to touch on that one for instance um look my my personal view is if you're not storing customer money you're not a financial service business and you shouldn't be regulated like one um obviously both of our companies we do store customer funds we are regulated like Financial Service businesses but you know it's I think that's a really dangerous place to get to if you if you're gonna say all right anybody just making hosting a website or building you know the browser equivalent or whatever it now needs to get it tied up in financial services regulation I think that's going to kill a lot of the Innovation and the thing the thing that some Regulators I think don't realize is that it's not like the citizens in your country aren't going to use it they're still going to do it they're just going to go you know use overseas like unregulated options so they're you're not protecting them by saying um we're disallowing it you're just pushing it offshore so anyway that's a tough one to Grapple with yeah it is and I think it ",
        "34": "gets even tougher when you know I was actually I was I was sitting down with a senior government official recently and um you know the the the view of this technology is is actually really colored by the presumption that like a blockchain's only purpose is to like transfer money and it's like no no no I had to like step back and say like these are basically like general purpose internet operating systems and they're solving a set of problems with with data and transactions and software that the internet hasn't solved before and it's like a whole new environment for a new class of problems that can be solved that are really important some of which are like very very consumer some of which are are very useful to the healthcare industry or whatever it is and like you have to really step back and realize that this isn't all just about you know um you know kind of regulating the storage movement of funds right and so if you if you inadvertently sort of put ",
        "35": "policies in place that kind of cap what you're able to do with this like these internet operating systems like that's a real problem and it was a little bit of a light bulb moment you know like oh God like this is way way bigger than I realize and like I I liken it to um you know during the the some of the growth phases of of the of the prior faces of the internet where you know everyone kind of got comfortable with the idea that there's an open internet and there's these open networks and you know if you have a piece of software and a computer that's connected to it you can kind of do whatever that software allows you to do and uh and people would build services that would you know enable free publishing and and you know and people would build services to do peer-to-peer Communications like messaging apps and Communications apps and all these things kind of grew up and one Instinct was like well that's a telecommunication service we should like it should have all the same things that ",
        "36": "happen with the telephone system or you know that's oh that's actually a a a radio broadcast that you're doing well you should have all the same licenses that you do to like stand put up a radio tower or whatever right and and so that the initial mapping of like regulatory Frameworks to open internet it just you know it actually that it happened but then it kind of like faded away because what happened to society it was like no this is way better like we really like this and we're and and then policymakers ultimately responded and were like okay we can live with the fact that people can have encrypted Communications now there are parts of law enforcement that don't like that and fight that but like broadly society's like yeah we this is a value right we we want to preserve that or they you know kind of um you know we're like okay there's there's YouTube and like terrorists can put recruiting videos on YouTube and yeah there's a process to like find them and take them down but like we're not going to ban ",
        "37": "YouTube um because like people want freedom of publishing information and yeah and and so imagine if you had to get a license before you could put a video up what age I mean that was like yeah I joke that I remember because in the mid 90s I was working on some of this stuff and it was like the big proposal was like to build a web website you need an FCC license and it's like okay hold on I was like and that was like a legitimate discussion in Congress yeah um and I feel like we're kind of in a similar place with this world of the the internet of value right and and and in some ways like if we keep building this and we keep making the kind of progress that's being made then like firms and households will say no I don't want you to like this is better like don't you can't take this away from me right and and that's at the end of the day like policy is the will of the people right yeah and so we we gotta we gotta make a lot of progress I totally agree I you know Society went through that big shift with like encryption was a scary word oh my gosh ",
        "38": "if you're using encryption you're a terrorist whatever and then right now you know with WhatsApp and signal and like this thing is running the whole world the iPhone itself like you know this is my private advice right yeah so encryption is not a bad word it's it's like more of like a fundamental right it's privacy that we want everyone to have so I agree it seems like the same story playing out again and um it is you know you always have to watch out for someone's like fear-based instinct to sort of like restrict something and then you miss you harm like the 99 as much as the one percent of bad people so yeah maybe last last question because we could go on forever and ever um but um it's actually related which is um you know public chains and and things like stable coins and Bitcoin itself right are are kind of expressions of you know money that exists at internet scale and has that are inherently Global and but monetary systems are so rooted in in kind of territories and in and and ",

        "40": "know every every major government pretty much is going to want to have a central bank digital currency or I think you know in the US's case it's going to end up using usdc as sort of like a de facto um cdbc you know they'll obviously regulated Fiat digital currency basically yeah and so that's great like there should be clear regulatory Frameworks Audits and all that stuff and then boom now there's we have a a way to have a wrapper around Fiat money and they they still control the money supply you know all that so it's like it's fun first of all it's just work with the current system totally but I agree with you I think as the crypto economy continues to grow and you know today it's so it's a small percentage of global GDP but it's similar again look at e-commerce right eCommerce 1909 was like nothing and now it's like 15 or almost 20 of global GDP I think and during covet it grew a lot and so what happens if you know in another 10 years we go by and it's like the crypto economy is 20 of global GDP okay well it wouldn't be very inclusive to use you ",
        "41": "know the currency of One Sovereign Nation inside the global system right and so I do think there could end up being a world where there is a more transnational currency that's being used and um honestly that would probably be more fair in the sense that there's not like some small number of people with their fingers on the dials who could change it too much now what exactly that'll look like I mean look I think Bitcoin is an incredible gold standard you know some economists would argue that for and I think it's really important to have a gold standard it some economists would argue that you actually want to have like a slight inflation rate to get something to be encouraged people to spend it um some you know the super stability yeah so you I don't know you I mean you could imagine a um a version of a coin out there that was trying to more tied to like CPI or just a flat two percent inflation rate or something like that that I think the crypto economy basically could come up with a better form of like a transactional currency that that's superseded or it might just be a basket of fiat currency or things like that so um I don't know exactly how that's going to play out but I do think that ",
