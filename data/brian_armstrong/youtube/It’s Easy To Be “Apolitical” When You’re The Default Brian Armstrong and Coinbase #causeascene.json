        "1": "know all i can go about what he said and then i read some of his like his culture um document i'll be putting all of that underneath this video so that you can have context and i find a lot of this stuff very problematic particularly the fact that when you're the default being apolitical is a choice so i've been trying to figure out how i want to go through this but um i just reread it and i took a little notes and i'm going to read through this but i want to start with the last page because um this is where it breaks down for me so um i'll go through but it says inc this is the conclusion this is on page um seven um of his this last page these are difficult times and every ceo i know is trying to figure out how to lead through it ",
        "2": "i recognize that our approach is not for everyone and may be controversial i know that many people may not agree and some employees may resign i also know that some of what i've written above will be misinterpreted whether intent accidentally or on purpose and so i want to just address this i'm not misinterpreting anything so i'm just i'm going by his words and i'm going to put something on top of it so i want people to understand that i'm not taking his words and turning them around i just want to us to look through a different lens his words through a different lens um but i believe it's right approach for coinbase um that will set us up for success long term and i would rather be honest and transparent about that then equivocate and work in a company that is not aligned i completely agree with that um this this last part that is ",
        "3": "guiding this whole conversation or dialogue i'm having we need to do a better job of being authentic about who we are and hopefully this blog post is the first step in that direction we are an intense culture and we are a political we are an apolitical culture there is nothing apolitical about work um and this is where i challenge we're also committed to making coinbase a place that creates incredible job opportunities and welcoming environment for every for people of every age race gender and orientation that right there is the first contradiction you cannot be a political and then put all people of every age race gender and sexual orientation when age race gender and sexual orientation are political they are political so you it's it's this huge contradiction and he's not the only one that makes it ",
        "4": "it is several when you're the default when you're the the white dude who was able to code something who was able to get money to fund something who was able to um get expertise and to help guide your choices that in itself is political since most people from marginalized communities underrepresented communities don't have that but specifically and you can say that's subjective but specifically you cannot be a political and still say that you are welcoming environment for every uh for people of every age race gender and sexual orientation not possible it's not the reality age is a um is a political issue race is a political issue gender is a political issue sexual orientation is a political issue are political issues so that right there is where it's it's ",
        "5": "the binary thinking that white folks do it's the on off switch it's the good bad the right this is not binary so now let me go back and break this down a little bit and so i'm just going to read through it on page one everyone is asking the question about how companies should engage in broader societal issues during these difficult times while keeping their teams united and focus on a mission coinbase has had its own challenges here including employee walkouts i decided um to share publicly how how i'm addressing this in case it helps others navigate a path through these challenging times i get it and i appreciate the fact that he wants to help others um in short i want cold bass to be a laser focus to be laser focused on achieving its mission because i believe that this is the way we can um have a have the biggest impact on the world that right there is not a political that ",
        "6": "right there is political the fact that you want to have a big impact on the world is not a political that is political that means you want to influence you want to change you want to all these that is not that is not a political statement we will do this by playing as a championship team focusing focus on um building and being transparent about our mission what our mission is and isn't so i fundamentally have a problem with this play as a champion championship team but i'm going to read you and then i'm going to keep going i'm going to explain during difficult times i think it's important to go back to the goal guideposts we've established like our culture dot mission and values i have also problems with his culture doc um and i'll put that in the um and again under the video because um it's a culture fit thing and culture fit is all inherently discriminatory um if you're bringing people in and you expect them to fit your culture ",
        "7": "that's inherently discriminatory uh one of the tenets of coinbase coin based culture doc is that we play like a championship team what does that mean be company first we act as hashtag onecoinbase putting the company's goals ahead of any particular team or even individual goals that makes sense to me um acts in service to a greater mission we have we have united as a team to try and accomplish something that none of us could have done on our own i agree with that this is why i don't like competition i rather collaboration because when you do competition or um oh no excuse me not competition when you do um uh what's the word i'm compromise i don't like compromise because if you think about how i see compromise it's like you have these paints colors right and everybody comes in and they put their specific assigned color on the table well then people's like well i don't like that color and i don't like that color and what you ",
        "8": "end up with is a whole bunch of that nobody wants um nobody at the table is happy but this is what is left because that's what basically compromises like what is left when everybody chips away at it i prefer collaboration we put all our paints together and we create something together that we couldn't create a crate by ourselves so i agree with that here's where i have a problem default to trust we assume positive intent among our teammates and assume ignorance over malice we have each other's back that historically is not true for marginalized people in in not only in tech space but in business period and so that is where the default this is where the default of being white male christian cisgender able body um is problematic because you believe that your experiences are universal and that's why you challenge when people say no that's not the experience i'm having that's not the experience i've historically have that's not experience that none of any of us are having if we're not the ",
        "9": "cis cisgender heterosexual christian able-bodied men of a certain age so no i don't default to trust you have to earn trust that's in every relationship any healthy relationship requires people to have earned your trust when you just give trust by default you can manipulate all kinds of things happen and so when you actually bring up a problem they don't understand because we're you trust me right here's nothing to do it if i trust you you've done something that has caused harm and that is something that we need to deal with this is not about a trust issue this is about your actions have caused harm your decisions have caused harm and we need to deal with that um so no i don't trust by default um people in marginalized communities have learned not to trust by default because when we do that we are harmed um it happens in our medical communities we have been experimented on it happens um in in educational systems ",
        "10": "um when the two white kids a white kid and a black kid have are exhibiting the same same behaviors but overwhelmingly the data shows that a white kid would get an adhd diagnosis and the black kid would get an ebd which is um um emotional defiant disorder uh ebd no emotional behavior disorder um diagnosis that's two different tracks um if i have if i've been labeled adhd then everything is about in my educational space is about helping me acclimate and get educat you know helping me differentiate instruction all these other things that help me in my education so i'm on the ebd track emotional behavior disorder all it is about managing my behavior that's it it's i and i've i've taught school i'm certified special needs it's not about getting them their education it is about keeping them under control in this environment so no ",
        "11": "trust by default is harmful it's historically harmful for the most vulnerable so no we're not doing that uh focus on what unites us and not divides us we create we help create a sense of cohesion and unity by focusing on what we have in common not on what we agree especially if it's unrelated to our work see this is where i i have problems because again it's the binary we're not creating wedges anymore right so you get a job somebody gives you a manual you go on a similar line you're making and there are other people there and you're making the same and exact same widget because that widget has to go in thousand different things in the in the objective view if you're successful does that widget work in the things you're supposed to work in that's not the economy we have anymore and that's not what this kind of business that's not even how cold um coinbase operates they're not a widget making company they are information creating company and what ",
        "12": "and to say that um what do you disagree with is unrelated to work is problematic specifically again when you have this oh we're trying to save the world mentality um the lines are very blurred between what is work related and what's not work related particularly as we see with the pandemic and people working from home and people have their kids there and all these other things work at home are very much entwined right now um and i see that going forward so to say that um especially if it's unrelated to work who gets to decide what's related to work if i'm dealing with something i'm at work and and i'm dealing with something it's work related um so um as sustained high performance as compared to a family um where everyone is included regardless of performance the championship team makes a concerted effort to raise the ",
        "13": "bar of talent including changing out team members when needed see this is this is why okay through this lens okay through this lens we start to have a glimpse of a solution the championship team wants to win and every teammate is willing to make a sacrifice to achieve that we have each other's back and focus relentlessly on the long-term goal of voiding distractions see this is where when you again everybody's not having the same lived experience a championship team let's look at because he has this picture of of michael jordan that team was michael jordan the other people played they were not equals they weren't treated equal they didn't make the same money equal they don't have the same money now years later equally so to make this assertion that so what what happened with with the bulls at that time was everybody played to michael jordan same thing you see with everybody plays to shaq everybody plays ",
        "14": "to um in football tom brady everybody plays to that how they play that is not team that is we play the one person who is elevated and that goes back into that culture that i'm really trying to get us to shed and tech the ninja the 10x the um the unicorns where we focus all our attention on these what people would consider high performance and i would have to challenge why are they high perform what what's what measures are you using for high performance are they just coding more are they just is it just quantity how is the quality how is that quality impacting other people there are other questions that have to be asked before somebody tells me that they're high performance and i believe it so um i have a real problem with that because the person if it's this is about team if you're looking at again michael jordan and right now i have no idea how many people on a basketball team but let's say it's 12. and michael jordan is number one ",
        "15": "number 12 should be getting the same treatment as number one and we absolutely know that that does not happen so now we're getting into the the next one is uh focus on building there are many places that a company can choose to allocate its limited time and resources i agree with that um and um there is never enough time to do everything so companies need to choose what change they want to see in the world and focus there it can take decades to move the needle on large global change challenges i absolutely agree with that and this is why so many people uh are frustrating for me because they're expecting overnight  to happen that has been going wrong forever and it's not going to happen overnight at cold base we saw that um we are focused on we say that we're focused on building what does that mean it means that we are going to focus on building the best company we can and making progress towards our mission as compared to broader societal issues ",
        "16": "okay uh we focus on the things that help us achieve that mission we build better products okay um um source amazing talent i um would have to see that to believe um because i saw um his there's also i'll put that under that they have this this this way of um evaluating talent and interviews um i would have to see the data that proves that that is better for um the most marginalized um fair talent practices and this is where i put the um we work to reduce unconscious bias in our interviews showing things like um using things like structure interviews and ensuring fair practices uh how we pay and promote that's another reason i have a problem with the word fair uh it gets it means who gets to define fear and that's people who have um the privilege um we pay uh for performance culture this is where this is where we start i see we're ",

        "18": "organizations but we don't we don't we don't can't even get to equity so that that statement in itself is problematic and does not resonate with the reality of business it's not just coinbase it is business period it is not performance culture um because there is not equality um and then the um we enable um belonging for everybody we work to create an environment where everyone is welcome uh we can do this we can do our their best work regardless of background sexual orientation race gender age again you can't be a political that's not a political we focus minimally on causes not directly related to our mission policy decisions if there's a bill introduced around crypto we may engage here but we normally won't engage in policy decisions around health care and education for example and see that i get it i get it ",
        "19": "and it's silo thinking though because to say i'm only gonna focus on stuff that's specifically the crypto when you're trying to change the world crypto is going to impact health care and education see you can't be in silos you have to think broadly you have to think these systems kryptos um a crypto economy is they is a economy and it touches other things it says nonprofit work um and then it says um uh oh no wait a minute um enabling um every belonging for everyone okay i did that one and that says we're minimally followed so i said process policy work and nonprofit work they have their little thing and then broader social issues societal issues we do not engage here with issues are unrelated to our core mission um because we believe impact only comes with focus again the impact ",

        "27": "if you want to change the world then that's saying that something is wrong with the world now and we have to challenge that and that's uncomfortable work you can't have it can't be either or can't be either or this is where the um there is a blurry line between moral statements and politics we could use our work day debating uh what to do about various unrelated challenges in the world again that's again that's that's that's triggering that's loaded various unrelated challenges um but that would be not be of service to the company or our interests as employees and shareholders see that that right there you you don't get if you want to change the world you don't get to dictate what problems are in the world that you want no if you're going to change the world you need to address the problems that the world has and so now we're in the what is the scope of the mission code base's mission is to create open financials and open financial ",
        "28": "system for the world again this world thing this means that we want to use cryptocurrency to bring economic freedom to people all over the world i realize that at some point this year that many employees were interpreting our mission in different ways some people interpret our mission um more broadly to include all forms of equality and justice it makes sense if you believe that economic freedom is not possible without equality for all people others interpret the mission more narrowly believing that we are trying to create infrastructure for a crypto economy and that yes we would create more equality of access for people for all people but we aren't we weren't trying to solve all ",

        "37": "but this makes sense if you only see marginalized people as consumers of your products and not as competitors for your products and services so i just wanted to really break that down because um again once i say it i can draw people you know drop um share this video with people but these are the conversations that i'm going to be having moving forward i will be dissecting these kind of resources that come out um so that people can see it through a different lens so thank you and have a wonderful day goodbye "
