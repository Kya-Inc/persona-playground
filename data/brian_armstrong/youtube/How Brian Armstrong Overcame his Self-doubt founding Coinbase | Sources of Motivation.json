        "0": "you know I had red Founders at work and I had read um Paul Graham's articles on his blog and all these things part of the reason why that that's so valuable and I think just the fact that YC wrote that first check to me was that at that time I was really filled with self-doubt I was not sure if I could be a CEO I thought of myself as really more of an engineer and not really good with people but maybe I was crazy because I thought this idea with crypto seemed kind of cool but all the smart people who I talked to didn't really get it and they didn't think it was a good idea so I thought maybe I was the crazy one yeah you know frankly I if YC had not written me that first check I don't think I would have started the company because I was working at Airbnb Airbnb was a rocket ship you know I would this sounds like really silly in hindsight but I I had to call my parents and tell them that I was going to quit my job and go go start this company and you know now that I'm I'm older and everything I look back on it fondly but at that time it was a big deal I was ",
        "1": "like deathly afraid of they were they were going to be really disappointed to me like you quit your job at this great company to go do something on your own and there in my parents mind you know my my parents are brilliant and they love me but in their mind you know an entrepreneur is someone who starts um you know like a a local shop and usually it fails and they their whole advice to me growing up was you know work at a at a big legitimate company that can make sure you have health care they would have loved if I had worked at you know Google or IBM or something like that parents are conservative on behalf of their kids aren't they yeah yeah for good reason I mean a lot of startups can be a little risky but in in Silicon Valley that's not really the case right if you raise if you raise a bit of money you can pay yourself a salary and if you even if it doesn't work you often have gained valuable experience that makes you even more employable but that's not true in most places of the world still and it may not be fully embedded in the parental wisdom so I guess the heart of your question though is about determination you know where did it come ",
        "2": "from I mean one thing is that I had tried starting a company before in in the education space and I tried a couple of a handful of other ideas that didn't work out and I definitely was filled with this desire what I really want to do something um important in the world I wanted to have an impact um it was probably you know you can get into the psychology of this but it was probably the root of it was you know I was always kind of a shy kid I felt like I had good ideas but I couldn't get people to really listen me listen to me they didn't think of me as a natural leader they didn't really look up to me and so I was not like confident or charismatic in that way and so I there was something about it was probably a deep insecurity really that was like okay I need to build something that is valuable in the world that people recognize um so that I can show the people I have good ideas or something like that feeling feeling worthwhile right or feeling uh worth something and so you know you have to find motivation in whatever you can get and then that pushed me through a lot of the early years I think um you know we worked incredibly hard uh ",
        "3": "we worked kind of 996 type hours um even though we didn't call it that at that time there was a lot of rejection you know like nine out of every 10 investors we pitched they said no as you pointed out you know some of them even kind of there was only one example I can think of where they might have been laughing at us a little bit uh but um you know Banks would you know hang up on us or shut down our account there was like early lawsuits there was early employees who quit there were a lot of dark days actually where um you know we had people like thousands of people customers upset at me people would like leak my phone number on the internet and I have just like a stream of angry phone calls and I'd have to delete the number and get a new one yeah getting getting sued getting employees quit like you know just feeling like the whole thing was gonna fail there's lots of moments like that and as a company grows and it starts to have more success you know your source of motivation I think has to change because if you have a you know if you have a fear of um ",
        "4": "you're running away from something like this fear of never being valued and suddenly you know you have a company that's worth a billion dollars or something some of that stuff starts to go away and I've seen this happen to some founder friends of mine where I think their motivation actually just kind of evaporates and um you know it's stressful to run a company and so like why am I going through all this all this pain if I now have filled whatever Gap that is and so they have to migrate to some other thing it's like with if you're moving towards something because it's fun or it brings you Joy or fulfillment or love or whatever you know I've seen people have to cross this divide of like okay running away from fear and anger or whatever and towards something they actually love at a certain point and that's I think hopefully how you can have longevity as a founder and start to just make it fun like okay what do I get to build today what do I get to do how can I learn from this experience and of course not every part of the job is going to be fun no there's no job where it's like 100 fun but you know hopefully it's like majority fun and there's still things I get to learn and do at coinbase that make it really fun ",
