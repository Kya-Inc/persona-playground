        "0": "foreign [Music] this is uh my kitchen table and also my filing system [Music] over much of the past three decades I've been an investor the highest calling of mankind I've often thought was Private equity and then I started interviewing while I watch your interview because I know how to do some interviews I've learned in doing my interviews how leaders make it to the top I asked him how much he wanted he said 250 I said fine I didn't negotiate with him I did no due diligence if I have something I'd like to sell and how they stay there you don't feel inadequate now because being only the second wealthiest man in the world is that right about a decade ago a young entrepreneur Brian Armstrong who was working at Airbnb left that company to start a company to trade cryptocurrencies the company started coinbase became one of the hottest IPOs on Wall Street this year because of the FTX meltdown ",
        "1": "coinbase has had some challenges I sat down with Brian Armstrong to talk about the future of his company [Music] so for those who don't know much about cryptocurrencies what exactly is coinbase and what does it do so coinbase is the primary Financial account for many people participating in the crypto economy so we help people buy and sell crypto we also help them use it in a variety of ways they can use it to send money do Commerce borrow and lend or yield on their assets so we think of ourselves as the primary Financial account for people in that crypto economy okay so I know you're different than another company I'll mention but is this what FTX more or less did as well theoretically for its clients was to enable them to trade so FTX did one piece of what I just mentioned which is the trading aspect that's correct what do you think actually happened to FTX you've been quoted as saying you think there was more than just occasional bad bookkeeping you think there was more to it than that is that right ",
        "2": "that's right and you know obviously I'm sitting here as an outsider but it seems pretty clear to me that it's not just um a run on the bank or you know poor management of funds it appears that they took customer funds from their exchange and actually co-mingled them or moved them into their hedge fund and then ended up in a very underwater position and that was I believe against their terms of service and against the law and so from my point of view it looks like a massive fraud and we know that because they turned off withdrawals and the customer funds which should have been held there one to one were not able to be withdrawn um so that appears to be a fraud from my point of view so in your view will the FTX bankruptcy hurt the industry and maybe produce enormous amount of Regulation that you may not want well I do think the FTX downfall is a bit of a black mark for the industry and it's not representative of the whole industry of course though and you know we in traditional Financial Services occasionally you see Bad actors as well like Bernie Madoff or what happened at Enron now in terms of Regulation you ",
        "3": "know I do think that um it won't be a bad thing we've actually coinbase has been calling for Clear regulation and trying to work with policymakers for quite a while we've made some progress on that across various G20 countries but I think it will serve as a wake-up call in sort of a moment of catalyst where we'll get more clear regulation in the United States and I think that'll actually be a really a good thing for both coinbase and the whole industry so for your company of people who are clients of coinbase you will reassure them I assume regularly or they can find out for sure if their account is managed the way it's supposed to it's not being used for some additional purpose is that right that's right so I mean we actually are very different than what happened with FTX so for one thing coinbase is based right here in the United States uh we didn't incorporate in an offshore jurisdiction like the Bahamas um we're also a public company which means we need we need to meet all of the audit requirements of a public company and so we show in our publicly audited financial statements that you know corporate cash is separate from customer funds and you don't have to take our word for it you know um you know a big ",
        "4": "four accounting firm has come in and proven that in these cases so there's there's other differences as well you know we're we have we operate in exchange but we've never created an exchange token like the way FTX did we never operated our own Market maker or hedge fund in the way that FTX did because we believe that that would be a conflict of interest so I mean the difference between the two firms I think cannot be overstated and it's really a validation of the approach that we've taken at coinbase over the last 10 years to sort of build this this business in a trusted and compliant way as opposed to what happened um with FTX so for people who may not be that familiar with what your service is let's suppose um I wanted to buy a stock I would call a stock broker or somebody that's a market maker say I want to buy a certain share they would say okay you pay a commission if somebody wants to trade a cryptocurrency they they in effect have an account with you I assume and they pay some kind of fee for the exchange is that right that's right trading fees is uh one of our major sources of revenue and yeah ",
        "5": "we've begun to diversify that as well so we've we have a different category of Revenue we call subscription and services which is has started to grow so that's about 36 percent of our Revenue in our last uh in Q3 of this year but today people have accounts with you they have a clear that you you if they want to pull their account out they can get the money I guess because you are not subject to a run of the bank an effect that's correct all customer funds are clearly segregated and health assets are held one to one for customers so there's really no such thing as a run on the bank in coinbase's world because well number one we're not regulated as a bank so we don't do fractional Reserve lending um but also um you know 100 of customer funds are stored one to one so if 100 of people want to come withdraw they can do that and we'll have their funds for them okay so you started the company in 2012 and you took a public I think in April of 2021. the IPO was enormous success and I ",
        "6": "think at the end of that day uh your company was worth maybe 75 billion or more and you were personally worth I think about 10 billion or more the company's stock has come down about 80 percent uh in recent times in part because of FTX and other things that are happening in the crypto world so how does it feel to be worth 10 billion dollars one day and not too long after a lot less well you know it's obviously been a difficult market for not just crypto but also really all growth Tech and biotech I would say too so you know we're in good company Netflix and Spotify and all these these companies have also come down similar amounts we knew that going public would not be an easy path especially with as in a new industry being a leader we wanted to be the first crypto company to go out there and we kind of assumed that it would take you know three four years to go through a cycle begin to educate build trust in the public markets and so that's the process we're going through now and you know my own personal um net worth is is not something that is particularly motivating to me in the sense of like driving personal consumption or something like that I'm ",
        "7": "I'm excited about building the things with technology and cryptocurrency is one of the most exciting areas out there right now so um you know I'm gonna I'm gonna keep working on this company for the next hopefully a decade or two and um I think it's an exciting road ahead so you told your parents you're going to start a cryptocurrency exchange what did they say um and my mom you know asked me if I was going to have health insurance which you know I learned you know even if you're creating a new company you can you can pay for your own health insurance all right let's go to talking about the time that you started the company and what were you doing around about the time you just started so you started in 2012 as I mentioned what were you doing before you started did you know a lot about cryptocurrencies where were you working ",
        "8": "yeah so before this I was a software engineer and product manager at Airbnb which you know the the travel uh home rental company and you know I studied computer science and economics in school I had tried creating a couple other startups that were not very successful one one of them in the education space and so while I was in working at Airbnb you know I kind of got to see they had they were trying to move money to 190 different countries all over the world both collecting payments and then paying out the people renting their homes and I was one of the engineers kind of working on that seeing how difficult it was to move money globally both you know how opaque the fees were how long the delays were um the chargebacks all kinds of things like that so you know at that time I I this was around December of 2010 I believe I read the Bitcoin white paper which came out and I really it captured my attention in a really profound way I remember reading it and thinking this might be one of the most important things I've ever read and it was saying something it was describing something kind of like the internet which was Global and decentralized a new protocol ",
        "9": "but instead of moving information around this was for moving value around in different forms and I basically just couldn't stop thinking about this paper for the last for the next six months after that I attended some meetups in San Francisco some early Bitcoin meetups and met some of the early people working on it and eventually I just couldn't get this idea out of my head and I decided I had to go try to build a prototype that would make this this technology easier to use and trusted for the average person so what was the valuation of your company for the first round from uh the First Investors uh well um you know I think y combinator probably got seven percent of the company for the 150 150 000 so you know not as not a very high valuation and then I think the series a was I think we raised five million at 25 million post so um you know obviously those investors did well so when their company went public they return on the initial Investments were staggering I remember reading about it at the time so I guess they were very happy with uh with you at the time I ",
        "10": "don't know whether they've sold their shares or they still hold them but still it's very profitable even at today's valuation I assume yeah that's correct I mean and they they earned it right so that's that's the nature of these bets is that um if you can see something early on that most people are skeptical of in your contrarian but right you know occasionally you get these massive wins that come out of it and I think you know a thousand when fan base went public a thousand people employees I believe became millionaires and you know a lot of the early people wrote me incredible letters telling us how they you know we had changed their life and all these things so that was a really powerful moment and as being a publicly traded company CEO a pleasurable experience or not you know I actually when I before we went public I didn't really know much about what it would be like and I went and did a bunch of research but um my research played out at roughly how I expected and I I actually kind of enjoyed being a public company CEO um it's a good forcing function for us to get feedback from the market ",
        "11": "um to get input from analysts and investors I've found their their thoughts to be actually quite um helpful in terms of operating our business periodically and then of course you know we I spend the vast majority of my time really just working with the team on how do we build better products for our customers I don't want to lose sight of that as the primary objective so let's talk about yourself for a moment uh earlier in your life where were you born I was born in San Jose California in Silicon Valley um yeah and were your parents technology people working at tech companies or something like that something like that yeah so my mom was a programmer and a manager at IBM so um we had a lot of the early IBM computers in our home and things like that my dad is a civil engineer and an environmental engineer so yeah we definitely had to focus on you know stem and Math and Science and education in my my household growing up I would say and when you were growing up what did you want to be when you were in high school did you want to be an athlete or a private Equity investor something important like that or what ",
        "12": "um you know I don't think I knew exactly what I wanted to be in high school I remember even in high school I was learning programming and I was learning computers um I was fascinated with that I built some early websites I even started a little business with a friend of mine in in high school we were kind of reselling computer hardware so I don't think I knew that I wanted to definitely be a tech entrepreneur but looking back in hindsight that's certainly where my energy and enthusiasm was and I was I was often staying up till 2 A.M you know learning Linux and computers in my bedroom whereas and I'd be sleep deprived and too tired to pay attention in History Class the next day at school but yeah that those were my early interests for sure where did you go to college I went to Rice University in Houston Texas and how long were you at Airbnb and how did you get that job I was at Airbnb for about a year and a half or so and they they I was employee number 40 I think when they joined when I joined and they when I left there was maybe 600 people so it had gone through this incredible period of growth I learned a lot from them actually um just about how to run a great you ",
        "13": "know product building process with Engineers how to raise money how to operate in Silicon Valley how to how to meet with people like at y combinator so I learned quite a lot from that process uh when you left to start your own company did Brian chesky the one of the CEOs and Founders are there tell you that you're making a mistake you should stay at a stable company like Airbnb well my boss at that time was uh Nate blacharzik who was one of the other co-founders at Airbnb and one the CTO and I remember he he was very supportive and obviously they tried to get me to stay a little bit but you know generally there's a really incredible culture in Silicon Valley uh you know employees who who are joining these early startups that sometimes they go on to do their own startups and it's it's very much a positive sum environment you know one of the things I'm most proud of is actually a lot of early coinbase employees have gone on to found other companies in crypto and that's been really positive and rewarding for us to see as well so you told your parents you're going to start a cryptocurrency exchange what did they ",
        "14": "say uh well I don't think they quite understood what it was at that moment um and my mom you know asked me if I was going to have health insurance which uh you know I learned you know even if you're creating a new company you can you can pay for your own health insurance and there's little things like that that made her sleep better at night but I think ultimately they they trusted me and they supported me even if they didn't quite understand what it was and they said well you know if this doesn't work out hopefully he can go get another job and help you find but they they sort of knew I was always going to try new things like this and it wasn't worth trying to talk me out of it at certain point [Music] [Applause] [Music] so what do you say to some of the old ",
        "15": "line investors old line mean people my age or older or maybe slightly younger than me who say that cryptocurrency really serves no useful social purpose and ultimately all cryptocurrencies will go to zero how do you respond to them yeah well look I think there's a long history in technology of bubbles being created and then Corrections and you know there's hype cycles and doom cycles and this has been true obviously with the internet in recent memory but even if you go back to the railroads and you know the telephone and all these things studying the history of this you see that when a big Technology Innovation happens early adopters come in you see a bubble form there's oftentimes irrational exuberance and then a correction happens but ultimately there is a breakthrough there and it takes sometimes you know a decade or more for these these benefits to come to fruition so that's exactly what's happening here with cryptocurrency you know one in four U.S households have now used cryptocurrency it's not a niche thing it does tend to skew towards a younger audience and so sometimes people who ",
        "16": "grew up in their whole their whole career was in traditional Financial Services it's hard for them to you know this is the innovator's Dilemma right if you if you can if people are familiar with the clay Christensen book it's hard for them to see this new thing coming along and seeing what the disruptive potential of it would be and there's sometimes a little bit of blindness that happens with that but um nevertheless the change is happening and more people are using crypto through every cycle that happens well before you started the company or while you were starting uh your company coinbase did you buy some cryptocurrencies yourself just to so show that you were a believer in it or do you not want to have a conflict by owning some of these cryptocurrencies I mean I really didn't have much money when I started um coinbase you know I had just left Airbnb I had a little bit of money saved but I had to I wanted to exercise my options in Airbnb when I left and that actually almost cleaned out my bank account so I think I had maybe like like three or four thousand dollars or something like that when I left over when I started coinbase so you know I certainly bought a little bit of um Bitcoin early on but we're talking about like a thousand ",
        "17": "dollars or something in that range for the first you know five years or actually I mean still to a large degree to this day I mean not myself and other employees early employees at coinbase we took our salary actually in Bitcoin so you can imagine that had some interesting appreciation value we you know we had to sell a lot of it to sort of pay rent and things like that so it wasn't um like we were able to hold all of it but uh yeah that there was definitely some appreciation there but I wish I'd had more money in the early days for sure okay so um how do you respond to the idea that many people don't know what they're doing when they're buying cryptocurrencies they're not that well informed they're very young and they're going to wind up losing their money because they're just not experienced how do you respond to that concern right well I think that's a very valid concern across really any type of investment that people might make not just in crypto but in stocks and in everything so my perception is that we actually do need more clear regulation that's crypto specific I mean crypto businesses like coinbase were already regulated like a traditional financial service business and you know we have a ",
        "18": "cftc license and we have fins we're registered with finson we have a New York bit license and various money transmission licenses that's that's just in the US um but I think we need more crypto specific regulation in the us both around stable coins how centralized exchanges and custodians are you know the best practices they should have in place around Audits and you know not commingling funds though many of those things we're already doing and then the big piece will be actually getting Clarity around what's a commodity what is a security what's a stable coin and we need sort of an updated version of the Howie test which is um something that the SEC uses to that applies more to cryptocurrency so there's a lot of legislation being put through Congress now and coinbase has been very active in DC working with policy makers there there's strong bipartisan support in the U.S to actually get clear crypto regulation um the FTX situation created a little bit of a delay in in the legislation that I was hoping was going to be coming getting passed in the next quarter or so but I think within the next year we can ",
        "19": "hopefully get something there in the US and then go for the rest of the G20 as well so Sam bankman freed was well known for giving money to politicians or as campaign contributions and for lobbying members directly in Capitol Hill do you go to Capitol Hill very much the lobby directly for legislation of one type or another are you very involved in political contributions so I go to DC historically I've gone to DC and maybe two or three times a year and um I imagine that may even be more frequent now in the next year or two um we've made small donations to certain candidates that are pro-crypto and we you know but just standard stuff like you know five thousand eight hundred dollars or these kind of basic minimums we don't actually we've never made any kind of donations on the scale that Sam McMan freed was doing through through these large packs and things like that and um you know part of it is like it's how the game is played you need to sort of make relevant donations that's what all companies do public companies do around policy issues but it does seem like the way that Sam was doing it where he was so visible in DC there was such a ",
        "20": "large amount of money I think I think he was the second largest donor to the Democratic party or something like that it does seem like it was happening at a different scale and um you know I think there's some really serious questions to be asked now about should should some of that money be clawed back because it appears that it was stolen from customers so when you come to Washington and you meet with members of Congress course do they really understand cryptocurrencies or you have to educate them a fair bit you know when I first started going to DC maybe eight or nine years ago I think many of them didn't understand crypto at all and there was a lot of very basic conversations I think today probably 80 percent of Congress uh maybe 70 80 understands the basics and they understand the potential of this technology that it has it has a lot of innovation potential which we want to preserve but it also has some risks and unfortunately it's attracted some some Bad actors to try to come into this industry to try to profit from it and so they recognize the balance the need for both clear regulation and preserving that Innovation potential there's still probably 20 I would say of Congress ",
        "21": "where they're either just very hostile to it or um or just ignorant of it but it's not the majority View at this point I've actually been very pleasantly surprised to see strong bipartisan support to get clear regulation but help this industry grow you know here in the United States in in the financial center of the world um as opposed to it being built you know in these Havens or off offshore jurisdictions where we've seen that customers can get hurt including U.S citizens who may be attracted to to those kinds of products I suppose I say I've listened to your interview and I like to buy some cryptocurrencies what would you recommend to somebody who doesn't know much about crypto about what they do to get educated and would you recommend to Let's suppose somebody's a young professional he or she has a modest amount of money in the bank would you recommend they put 100 in crypto five percent how what do you recommend the people that they do if they want to experiment investing in crypto right so we're not a registered investment advisor so I have to be a little careful I mean we're not giving ",
        "22": "any investment advice to people but what I would what I do personally and what I would you know what I would tell people I should say personally is that um if this is something new don't invest in anything that you don't understand and if you want to learn about it you know you can put one percent of your net worth into it or something like that that you would be okay if that if it all went to zero but um if if it's not then that's a way for you to dip your your toe in the water and hopefully you know own a little piece of this crypto economy that's happening more and more on the internet for the next five or ten years so um I'm more in the mindset of personally I don't actively trade crypto or anything like that I'm more of like a long-term buy and holder and then I just try to help the company build good products and services so I'm not like an active Trader of crypto personally so for somebody that um is a young person watching he would say I want to be Brian Armstrong I want to be able to be a person who starts a company very successful a leader in in his industry what would you recommend is the skill set where the kind of things that somebody should do to become you ",
        "23": "well it's odd question I'm sure some people want to do that not everybody wants to do that but for people who do I think number one is study engineering science math stem I think that's that's the language of our future that you can have the most impact um and then I would say try building companies I think that building technology companies is probably one of the best levers we have to improve the world regardless of what a problem we're talking about whether you know that's climate change or fixing educational Healthcare or anything like that so and you know starting companies is hard um I started a number of companies that didn't work or they were barely successful in some small way and it was you know coinbase is probably the 10th idea that I had that I tried and that one ended up working really really well um but there's there's others that I hope to create in the future and I'm maybe some will work some won't and so you have to be okay with resilience and and failures and setbacks along the way ",
