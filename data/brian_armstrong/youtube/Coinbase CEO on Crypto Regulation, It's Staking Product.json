        "0": "Ryan thank you so much for joining us you recently made this big interesting bet as a centralized exchange on decentralization a year or so ago you know decentralization was a big worry for traditional Financial players but more so now there are a lot of concerns about the space so what is the case for traditional Financial players to care about defy yeah but we're definitely excited about defy at coinbase and we want to make sure we help build the future of this technology here in America actually a lot of traditional Financial Services firms are integrating this technology I mean everybody from you know JP Morgan visa and MasterCard Franklin Templeton they're all have they have projects and teams internally working on how to integrate crypto into their services and I think the reason for that is that you know 80 of Americans are not happy with the current Financial system as it is today they think it's it's too slow the fees are too high it doesn't serve everybody equally and a lot of the technology was built 40 years ago the laws were 100 years ago and so people are really ",
        "1": "excited about how crypto as a technology can help improve and update the financial system and that's why that's why we're here at coinbase we want to make sure that we enable that as well still near your term challenge challenges and which are the biggest among them are they the idea of hacks and any vulnerabilities in the system or is it the regulatory environment in the United States yeah I mean my number one priority this year is the policy environment so we need to make sure that that gets to a good place in the U.S you know that the rest of the world has actually embraced crypto we've seen all the major Financial hubs Singapore and Hong Kong and London and you know the EU just passed comprehensive crypto legislation so really what I believe should happen in the United States is that we need we need a clear rule book so that this industry can be built here you know we don't want it to be like 5G or semiconductors that went offshore it's actually a matter of National Security we get the future of the financial system built here inside the United States and so I've been spending more time in DC here in New York but in DC in particular we're trying to meet with the relevant folks that could help draft legislation so Congress can come ",
        "2": "in and pass comprehensive legislation before we get to the Washington of it all I want to still look out five years from now because there are a lot of financial players as you say that are looking at tokenization a lot of it's happening in the private markets to the extent that you think traditional Securities can be tokenized five years from now are you working with collaborating with any banks to get to that point yeah so crypto is many different things right there's there are crypto Securities which we believe there should be a robust market for that in the US in fact we acquired a broker dealer license it's still dormant right now but we'd like to work with the SEC to activate that and create a healthy Market structure to trade crypto Securities now you know of the Thousand assets we've looked at at coinbase you know 800 of them we've rejected we don't think we have maybe their Securities 200 or so of them we have listed on our platform We Believe those are Commodities and so we're going to continue to build that piece of our business we're regulated by the cftc for instance and make sure we grow that piece as well but crypto is many things it's it's Commodities it's Securities it's stable coins it's artwork it's ",
        "3": "decentralized identity systems and so it's uh tough for people to wrap their head around but it's ultimately going to have many different Regulators you know before we get to the regulatory part of this too we were talking kind of about traditional Financial players and what role they have in this place in this system what kind of relationship do you have to high frequency trading firms prior to the implosion of FTX you saw them working for example with IEX have you had any conversations with them or any others well we're always talking with different firms out there and other exchanges that may want to trade crypto in various ways you know we can act as a brokerage exchange a custodian we can play different roles in different Market structures and in financial services you often see um you know a company that may compete on one product they're actually collaborators on another product and so we want to make sure that we're helping integrate crypto into all aspects of the financial system so we can update the financial system so you were talking about the SEC the cftc the sec's crackdowns as of late in particular you work with a lot of Institutions hedge funds had been very much getting into crypto prior to last year I'm wondering ",
        "4": "if the sec's Crackdown is starting to scare any of them away well in a way actually I think coinbase has been a net beneficiary of this because there's essentially a flight to Quality um you know coinbase we're we're a public company we have audited audited financial statements we're a qualified custodian I mean we're basically D choice you know based here in the US that hedge funds are going to want to work with and so in Q4 I mentioned this on our earnings call actually that we saw an increase in the number of Institutions onboarding to coinbase now a lot of them haven't deployed substantial Capital to crypto yet in this market environment they're kind of waiting and seeing but it's great to see them onboarding and that's kind of a coiled spring that I think could unleash a lot of potential in the next uh in the next Market change hedge funds still flocking to crypto listen we are resetting here just really quickly here with a Brian Armstrong the CEO of coinbase for our Bloomberg television and radio listeners uh getting into the complicated regulatory environment now stable coins you were talking about how there are multiple Regulators for the crypto industry but who should be the ",
        "5": "primary regulator for stable coins and is there a case for them to be overseen more like money market funds well I think Congress ultimately is the one that's going to create the laws in the United States right and so we could probably use new legislation new laws around how stable coins should be regulated I don't presume to tell them how to do that but I think some of the key things are uncontroversial I mean we need to have uh one-to-one backing of assets Behind These stable coins we need to have audited financial statements to make sure the firms issuing these are are doing a good job so these are just kind of basic good practices and I think a stablecoin bill is one of the first things that could really help um you know get consensus and move things forward in DC to fix I used to concerns around the stablecoin industry what would they be I mean as broadly as a concept I don't have concerns about it there may be individual stable coins which are better or worse I mean we actually recently delisted uh you know busd as an example and the reason we did that was you know paxos had gotten who's the issuer of busd had been kind of ordered to stop ",
        "6": "minting it so we were concerned about liquidity issues for our customers but you know we're always evaluating through our internal processes different stable coins different assets and updating when we see new information that comes to light I'm curious about your own way of using stable coins recently in the fourth quarter it showed that in your filings it showed that usdc has doubled in your Holdings prior to the quarter before why is that the case um well okay so usdc is is growing quite a lot and I think actually usdc is it's the best answer to a stable coin in the United States right it's it's issued by Circle which is a us-based company we're in partnership with them and we want to see that grow it's also been a really nice source of subscription and services revenue for us which is you know in contrast to trading fees which are quite volatile we've seen in our Q4 earnings that our subscription and services revenue is now 47 of coin business Revenue almost half and so that's allowing us to build a more predictable business with a diversified set of revenue streams so yeah I'm quite ",
        "7": "bullish on USD coin and I feel like that's a good solution for the US does that look a lot more like traditional banking not necessarily no I mean in traditional there's many differences you know in traditional banking they you know there's fractional Reserve they have banking licenses there's Capital requirements um everything in USD coin is backed 100 there's no fractional Reserve so I think of USD coin as a really important tool to help payments be more efficient globally it's helping provide you know access to you know something like a bank account but it could be self-custodial for many people around the world who don't have access to a stable currency it can improve even you know a lot of defy which you mentioned at the beginning um the the trading pairs are are denominated in USD coins so these are all good things which are an important part of the ecosystem so so let's move to the staking part of the business here because you have been concerned you have voice concerns you and your colleagues about the sec's definition of staking and how they've approached staking are you prepared to fight the SEC at any front if you need to when it comes to ",
        "8": "the staking world yeah so I mean we recently saw there was a settlement with Kraken that's another exchange out there and they have what they call a staking product it was kind of more of a yield product but you know in coinbase's case our staking product is not a security there's many differences I mean we customers never turn over their assets to coinbase for instance they're they're always in the customer's possession and we're really just providing a service that passes through those coins to help them you know participate in staking which is a decentralized protocol so that's an important part of you know the crypto economy that we want to make sure that we ensure that that's out there and you know we're prepared to defend that in court if we need to but you know we never we're never looking for a fight we want to work collaboratively with Regulators all over the world but you know we have to follow rule of law and in this case I think we're well within the law given the stance that SEC has been taking regarding defining certain assets as securities is there anything that you think we'll need to get to that point well you know the SEC has expressed ",
        "9": "their view about what is a security and they've taken kind of an expansive view of that I think I you know coinbase we've evaluated over a thousand different assets and as I mentioned earlier 800 of them we've rejected and we do think they have some properties of being a security so we don't trade those today another 200 or so of them we do trade today and we feel that those are Commodities so you know look I think as a as a CEO we want to basically just have a clear rule book right and if a clear rules are published we're happy to follow it and if those rules change you know we're happy to follow those um but I think you know when we when we became a public company we explained to the SEC in our S1 filing and in dozens of meetings that we've had with the SEC I think we work pretty collaboratively with them we've explained our business to them many times including in our S1 and you know they approved us to become a public company so we'll continue working with Regulators all over the world about where the boundaries are on what's a commodity what's the security or what is something else resetting once more for our Bloomberg radio and television audiences in conversation with coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong you know we're talking about the SEC and ",
        "10": "state Regulators as well you know in regulatory filings you've noted that you've received investigative subpoenas from the SEC and state Regulators how and when do you get those resolved yeah well subpoenas are really just requests for information right and so we're in dialogue with Regulators not only here in the U.S at the state and federal level but really around the world I mean um we're in Europe European markets and you know in Singapore and in Australia et cetera Canada many different markets around the world so I think subpoenas are an important part of the process that's that's them asking us a question and saying we'd like more information on this and we're happy to do that it sounds like it sounds like there was a tension between the SEC and the industry before it sounds like some of those tensions have boiled up after FTX I'm wondering if you think that the conversations between coinbase and the SEC in particular have gotten more or less contentious over the years I think we have a good relationship with the SEC Commissioners and staff and um you know I've met with the chair as well and so we're going to continue to invest ",
        "11": "in those relationships I would like us to find a way to bring crypto I think this is what they want too our interests are aligned we want to bring this this industry within the regulatory perimeter so that we have good consumer protection but we also preserve The Innovation potential of this and and as I said earlier you know 80 of Americans want the financial system to be updated and this is the most important technology I'm aware of that can help do that so you and your colleagues have also voiced a lot of concerns today you voice concerns about kind of more of the crypto industry moving offshore draw us a picture here of what happens in 5 10 20 years if the digital asset landscape exists mostly outside of the United States yeah in exchanges that are not based here yeah well I mean look I think that would be a terrible mistake for the United States I mean look at what's happening with AI right that's an important technology Trend where it's becoming a matter of National Security right that some of these things are built in the U.S or we saw it in the past with 5G or with semiconductors and so if we have this really powerful technology cryptocurrency that has the ",
        "12": "potential to update the financial system and improve it in so many ways how can we sit on the sidelines in America and say oh okay well we're going to let you know the EU pass comprehensive legislation so it'll be built there and we're going to let the UAE and you know London and Singapore and Hong Kong I mean this is America we need to be a technology Hub we need to be a financial Hub and the the future of this industry needs to be built right here in America "
