        "1": "which I thought maybe was just gonna be a couple of years in Bogota Colombia and turned that we've been away 10 of the last 11 years in Colombia London Stewart's Afghanistan for a year I took a gap year and went travelling then we went back to Ottawa and then we've been in Reykjavik Iceland for the last three and a half years my dad grew up on a farm in Manitoba just called often to sort of Norfolk Brandon finished high school worked at Eaton's for a year and then joined the RCMP so did his training in Regina and this is first posting in Surrey BC which he didn't like at all who's the big city I think and was far away from the prairies didn't really care for it in volunteered to go up to Alexandra fjord for this three-year stint in the middle of nowhere in the Arctic he had never been ",
        "2": "north so made history of commitment and was there for three solid years never getting out while getting out I guess was going to alert or the priests fjord and they went to also over in Greenland to Greenland I think once or twice so he was there with another RCP and then there were two special constables both into it and their hands were were there as well and they had multiple children at the time so he he had enough spending time there and then he moved around the north he was posted in strange thing off in plan point when the miner first opened in around 60-63 64 then listen for a Smith for resolution and the other places that I was when I was born so spent Tasya his entire career ",
        "3": "the north and anyway these images were they were originally the reason for the Matthews being there was this kind of a sovereignty exercise there were at the time I guess worried about a lot of the Greenland you know were coming over mostly in the in the winter in the spring they had built some turf houses there and anyway they're worried about the Danish flag being you know poked in this tundra and and so so sovereignty exercise they head to our sampie and these special constables out there to basically tell them you know you can stay and take out citizenship or or or go home so that's what he did for three years I think they had a fair bit of time on their hands so he took a lot of photos when he was there but also has kind of established a relationship with the the newest special constables and their family's wealth over there so I'll ",
        "4": "just yeah start going through some of these these photos and see how far how far we get if you've got any questions just let me know unfortunately the I was in a bit of a rush when I was putting these together they're they're sort of clumped in a bit of an order but they're a little bit scattered as well not not so perfectly sequenced I was like I said I was trying to get some my dad's thoughts and get this done before his condition deteriorated too much and so this is mr. Sorrell rehab so the this settlement itself was very small with only a few buildings they would be happy and the other SMP had a house that they lived in the two Indians families had a house and then it was sort of shed and another storage area the they came up from it was from Montreal on the ",
        "5": "Labrador took the ship up and and they would just get a shipment once a year in the summertime all of their wealth it wasn't any fresh produce all the frozen meat and canned goods and flour and all this stuff they would get yeah in the summer time and basically have destroyed it live off that all year so the steward come up in the summertime obviously when there was no no ice and they'd unload all supplies so that was so they'd have to get the they were running off generator so they'd have to get all their their oil and basically everything everything they needed to survive for the year so this is the this is it the few the the two buildings where they left have been a couple of sheds they did have a couple of boats ",
        "6": "that they could go out and and and obviously they just had dog teams and sleds in the wintertime to get around in the summertime they the Inuit families would take some time off and just go and and camp basically in tents with their families just to get a bit of time away from my dad and the other guy that was there and live off the off the land a bit and so that was well that this did part of the two families that were there just with your tent set up and doing that a summer so I'm camping on the land this is part of the barrage of just bringing in the supplies for the winter and for some reason they've got their read searches but I think they must have ",
        "7": "the idea was probably a photo op I think whoever was coming on the ship wanted to have them in uniform for that and then yeah the the ladder come up I think had a couple helicopter Sonics that you would call but your dad said that both no I didn't actually there's another close up later on people in it yeah [Music] this is just very tough in this spring Frankie seems eager adults and or fewer piece else Brown just in case people in the middle have to weigh that ",
        "8": "specifically this insurgent onto target is the sound of that yeah okay it shows the people maybe I was on the left I guess that yeah a few first pitch you see there and then the other guys just from from the lavatory this is the two special constables that were there when then when they key was there so they had a small boat like this to go out in the the they got all of their meat and stuff at the one time of the year and then there was to speak sort of freezer that was dug into the ground that's something how'd everything that they needed frozen for the for the year and this permafrost out there anyway so I was they didn't mean to elect a free service to to do that and they did a fair bit of hunting in the summertime because they needed food for the dogs ",
        "9": "they didn't eat any of the local meet the the Inuit obviously did but they had all that of course there's just stuff made so all of it just needed meat in the winter time to feed the dog terms and make sure they were kept alive so that's just see some photos coming up with hunts that they went on mostly for walrus and and seal these are our turf paths of the I think but you can see too in this photo I'm here and the one to somehow I think they were about two or three of them that the Greenland Inuit would built and used when they when they came over to hunt and [Music] that's another picture there it's very ",
        "10": "similar to we're in we're in Iceland right now and you can see the same construction they've got the Vikings haven't left some of these turfs structures are they still exists and it's so fascinating you see the simulator is between them that between these and what's what's actually nice and happy there's another [Music] now this yeah house this is some of the landscape [Music] these are the two special constables and the anon I personalize the is I think Pete Sims series they sort of been come and go at the same time the recipe officers is a bit of overlap so there were two different guys in in the camp ",
        "11": "at the time my dad was there for his three-year stint okay yeah so this this is one of those senior RCMP who'd obviously come up for a business so he's in full uniform so I think my dad and instance were in there a search for that vicious they didn't wear that very office obviously they probably only worth what city I'm sure so that's actually yeah that's that's Alex I know a few origin and it was a glacier that came came down very close to to where they work they didn't have they just got their wire basically from the from the glacier and the runoff from that [Music] there's a you can see there's a serial number that I guess there they had ",
        "12": "sidewalks connecting the houses and painted a bunch of stones white connecting them with mushrooms that help on the winter time obviously but I guess it was pretty in the summer and then they used this was their radio frequency so if it was a plane was flying over something it could be in contact with with them they're getting communication with them if they wanted to Friday but the two houses who were there two houses one was for the for my dad and the other guy that was there and then the other house was for the Inuit family which must have been rather cramped because they each had at least four kids and so there was at least a dozen people thinking the other hosts just what your father's coming in I mean there's there's lots of stories from the previous decades and other RCMP posts of RCMP all the students died after posting right there's a graveyard at Devon Island it was rifles medic discharged ",
        "13": "during a walrus on through there's dangers did your dad have any conception really of how isolated and you know something were to happen to him it was really hard for me to get evacuated to did y'all talk about that at all no I don't think I really considered so because I had the same sort of we were just going over these last week when I saw him again and I mean I knew there were there were families there were small kids but I didn't realize how many babies were actually born there when he was there and I said well how did that work he said well the two wives just helped each other during their pregnancies and and he was always there during the pregnancy not to help but just in case and I said well but if something happens it was a problem with baby and mother and he said well they would have died because there was no way of getting them in or out or getting any healthy and it was something that wrong so I wrote this one picture so we'll see ",
        "14": "but there was something about him having to learn basic dentistry if someone is looking manual because someone had an abscess - there's something that we yeah and there's a missing shots here of him giving vaccinations - just some of the kids as well just they would bring in some of the medicine in the summertime and they were basically responsible for giving the kids the vaccinations they need yeah this makes that stupid but like I'm amazed with these are in colors yeah and like it's not you know like green it's really good color yeah you know I mean with with photography something that your father did before he went up or he just kind of locked into busy processing the film would be without it yeah I think so there's a dark room set ",
        "15": "up in the limited space they had I didn't really consider should be photographer at all growing up but we've got some that's the thing that I me the stuff has been in the trunk forever we've got some family photos that he has slides of the large part of those I haven't actually seen although get around to doing that now that I've started this project but yeah I was I was struck by the quality of the images when I first started looking at them I mean II think you David in these old cartridge trees and then sort of a few years ago he started he thought it would be easier if he started putting him into these characters with the old projectors - Stefan that was a sec oh my god that's such a waste of time we need to attics digitized because that you can look on the TV and the computer blip so thankfully I was able to sort of steal the slides without him knowing let ",
        "16": "me just get them digitized it's - Heather and so the others it's it's it's great to have them like this but he learned that those skills yeah you know they're because you have them anyone out there like any other a fair bit of time on his hands what communication facilitates it would just be amateur radio kind of end of the day anyone the atmosphere is doing yeah very much so I think they were able to terrain you you know some of it Julian some of them closer spots and have a chat everyone so it was pretty we stopped his horse I'm sorry could you boys not just most oh yeah [Music] yesterday at there were I think they ",
        "17": "each yeah each I see if you've ever had their own dog team and then each of the special constables had their own dog cave so there were a lot of dogs to feed which necessitated a lot of hunting in the summer to get stealing waters for them this I think it was just a tourist who flew in during the the summer period which didn't happen very often I don't think but I was also talking to my dad about because they did hunt a lot of walrus I'm like what what he to do with all of the ivory like all the tests you must have he said one of the one of the guys was was a carver and so he he's got this cribbage board that's who that's made out of an ivory test from a walrus and I said well but you were hunting walrus all the time for dog food I wanted to do with all the rest he said they used to people that would come in from the South Canada or whatever they were just sort of you know trade it for alcohol or ",
        "18": "alright or whatever they needed basically or whatever they were short of and sort of barter private that would be yes that's a picture of the the pathways connecting that the buildings it's right I love what your dad said I was here I just see a sign like that and then he talked about weight washing yeah I love that and I asked him why and I loved it because he said this a lot of it was something to do [Music] oh sorry distant Arsenal's previously mentioned the T notices which visitors were autistic waiting for your question I know it's under stations for yourself largest station of the magical scientists come up to researching was the station true small safe take that even if they were in here yeah I mean there's time there's no place for them to stay that's communication it was just less effectively easy to get in and out of it so yeah this bent the NS this is ",
        "19": "another shot from just after the left where they have all their supplies delivered it just took a while to sort everything through find a place to store the stuff for the winter this is oh yeah one of the it's just from from one of the house they're just talking to have tea and incur what they need from from the animal not quite sure if this is a seal or walrus yet I think it might be a walrus but like yeah the the you know we're using a lot of the animal either for their own consumption or or obviously for the for the for the dogs ",
        "20": "[Music] there's so that they has a smaller boat that he already saw and then this is the larger boat that they used to go out and kind of longer excursions although those were rather entry Quinta's as well they didn't do a lot of overnight some on the boat according to my dad it was mostly used to tell them with hunting and when he pull up big boat to visit the the special hospitals when they were camping all that yeah I think so I don't think they ventured very far actually when they were going to set up their summer camps [Music] oh that growing up my my dad always had this thing hanging in the in the garage ",
        "21": "or wherever it normally in the garage and it was a walrus penis which was rather large and long and that was the one that was taken out of anyway apparently they had to dry out and the one that we hadn't been drying up for most of my life I think various parts that we places that we lived in so that's what that is a picture of them hunting and they often have to do they were just set up anchor and and then they were guys would try to have the best place to hunt and find the seals get their binoculars to telescope to see what was there how many how to get on and off the ",
        "22": "boat oh that's the actually best fish with the glacier that that comes down right close to the camp you can see that yeah this is something right hand side there that was the other cook for themselves so my I guess my dad learnt to Vega from his mom and this was just some cases different they were okay you know he sorted the early hipster you know I don't think that was a picture I think in this badge that he was shaving off his beard and he no I mean I never knew him to have a beard growing up so I don't think this lasted the entire three years says he was there I did my dad was much of a pet person growing happened ",
        "23": "then you know now I see the end up seeing his photos of these puppies and the dogs in the house which he grew up on a farm and the dogs are never allowed in that pets are never left the house and house and he's up there and a little bodies are running around and lying all over the place and on the couch and also family there's the glacier [Music] that's what you from the hunt [Music] the that Christmastime they always had the two you know families over for dinner they had the drop at Christmas time where they were drawing on my Christmas tree and the turkey and some mail I think and usually a bit of alcohol that was well packaged that ",
        "24": "wouldn't get damaged on the drop and and then my dad was also saying that his visit mom they've got to talk to them occasion I think over over the over the radio and so his mom would get the ages of the kids and their clothing sizes tell the wives and stuffing then send up clothes at Christmastime and gifts and gave us a stuff that for the kids so they would all get together and get dressed up and and come over for Christmas dinner kids it's interesting people who all want has yeah this magic yeah all that it won't have a sim anytime and faith that was my dad's dog because they each have their own team so they had a lead dog which after three years when he left he had to shoot because the ",
        "25": "dog wins okay you know and be able to lead the team with the new guy coming in so it was it was Stephanie his dogs unfortunately he left the dog had to go the the the Inuits that were there did some trapping in the winter time partly so these are safe foxes that they would trap and collect the pelts and then they would think they were sort of do office Shipman and it would go down to Grise fiord where there was a little co-op and they would get some money just so that it would be able to come bit of spending money and there was a store my dad and the other guys sort of ran and could if they need to selling tobacco and and some foodstuffs that sort of thing but did you do not say that they weren't supposed to they did their trade first ",
        "26": "what they also yeah they also do yeah I think what was the relationship with the special constables were they I mean these it sounds like the government earlier since he was provisioning your dad and where his heart is there with me but they weren't necessarily provisioning the special constables I think they were as well for okay for some things but probably not for it not for that back room yeah exactly those sorts of things so this is yeah the kids when they got that mr. Chrisman mic on my dad's mom and all the other guys discovered to send up some games and coloring books and different stuff so that was all new and interesting for the kids did you see their nice really interesting were these kids they were just dressed up for Christmas do they ",
        "27": "normally dressed in dresses and shirts that like this sir you know do you see I don't think so good yeah so this would be just the drop for that year yeah yeah this was this wasn't Christmas dinner because they must've got two turkeys maybe one for Christmas my for a new year so this was just the dinner for the two of them not the big dinner that they're having with the other families but they would be pious and so when they're out they would come across different artifacts as stuff and so a lot of stuff they were they would collect and then try and document some of the stuff they just put back where it was other stuff depending on the nature of us I think some of the stuff got sent ",
        "28": "south to downto to Ottawa or for collection depending on whatever what it was like a big thinker look at the a very old Wisconsin that's a police plane on skis those men in the wintertime and they just use the oil the empty oil barrels to sort of make a little you brought me [Music] oh sorry just a question of a fools are not suing that's probably not if you know the previous one is did they have to stop me straight must remember flatten out the really strip at all orders this they just anytime helter ",
        "29": "skelter on a fairly flat spot yeah essentially okay it didn't happen be machinery is really quick after their today to do this Tara give the name of sorry two days no there's another there's another radar station very good yeah I think that's where this is digging there's not that many aerial photos because he didn't get a chance to go up in the plane very often but there are a few friends one before was that tell there's a scenario floor where that's is their community there on the side little chair maybe that's looks like that would be tuning in because there's a lot of kids ",
        "30": "in salary this there's a few here this is in Greece fjord guys he was bought pilot he was in the RCP I did you each other for quite some time we were actually in the element together so this was a little trading store or a lot of the first stuff the Fox was what they came there they got accustomed some money to buy some stuff there or buy some tobacco stone back in Santa Fe that would be yeah survey would run this I guess but I thought I thought he said it was the RCMP that actually come because the strange that has the the NWT coat of armor something I'm sufficiently ",
        "31": "obvious me think it was bro that's my dad and they came across a herd of muskox and I think they were probably fighting by the day this little one was frightened by the the plane with Atlanta they've got separated from the rest of the herd so he so cute that's one of my favorite photos anyway they managed to get the little guy back into the to the rest of the that hurt get the back to us there and then this is the this was taking obviously a different time in the summer but I was trying to find it for my dad where this was actually taken because it's very it's very green and this lab trauma center and push around yeah is ",
        "32": "either in Greenland or it's just in a different part of southern part of expressing because there's definitely was there a lot of interaction with animals where are your tie the stage like the big goodbye or like did the musk ox like herds or groups I don't think most of us around them but they definitely have yeah I think so just know it's fun of it they shot one of them hundreds did because they can you obviously use the hide and and some of the other president this is backing to to the infant before in the Eureka morning yeah we came from Y element she nice have you guys heard of for their who's ",

        "35": "[Music] trees that's the dogs to stick your brain through out hunting right now you can see on the right here this is a mother used to it's just a white canvas basically with wood so they would hide behind that so that the seals couldn't see them when they pop their heads up and then she live it's the dogs having a break and the guy found sweetie probably a cigarette this product is the Inuit hunters I guess they say polar bear had come across and they didn't see the have any loved ones so the bulgarians live getting getting shot and then it was only after the fact ",
        "36": "they realized if it was a couple of cups that was with us this is America and that's one of the they call those things for minorities yes sir leases so it's basically got the tracks in the back and then there's two skis on on the front two to steer [Music] death of a lot of times when was there were somewhere with the dog tubes and there's planes in stuff like that big sort of have to line up the dog teams in a certain way in front of the plants of the pilots Wonka picture dating with the flame the background hand the dog to them and everything so it's a bit of a process I was about to pass or but I think Sims did some sewing there that's the in the background now this is just a ",

        "46": "when he was there and these special constables were posted and I think both of them came from Bath and Island maybe not exactly sure which communities they came from and so they would have had a bit of English obviously dealing with the RCMP from the jobs there but I'm not sure their family members their wives and their kids okay any English at all so yeah I think the communication was a bit of a challenge at times [Music] he's telling her there that's a little fun yeah yeah they had to anchor it out and then be careful yes so people did you want to go back a ",
