        "0": "Interruption that liquidity shrink was interrupted when Bank of Japan changed ycc they went in and they bought 400 billion dollars worth of bonds to defend their bond market very odd situation they raised rates but then liquidity exploded on it and then obviously the debt ceiling um secretary yellin Drew down the TGA that's basically the treasury savings account from 700 billion to practically nothing last week that also ended up in non-issuance of government debt so that was a big boost of liquidity all that is set to change now actually the TJ is going to go the other way she's already stated she wants to build it back up to normal levels so you're going to have probably about 800 billion in treasuries issued between now and Year End the Fed will be continuing on with QT you've got the student loan thing which I think has kept consumption up that's all changing ",
        "1": "in September they're going to have to actually God forbid the United States somebody actually pays interest on a loan so to me the probabilities haven't changed it's been pushed out relative expectations but in no way does the fact that it hasn't started yet change the probability of whether it's going to be hard or soft I would actually argue since it's taken so long the FED has ended up with a higher terminal rate and in fact inflation gets stickier the long it stays in the system that it increases not decreases the probability of a hard Landing by the way after the 87 crash I was convinced we're going to have depression so I've been wrong before and if I'm wrong on this I'll I'll adjust but I have to weigh the probabilities and do what I do with my process and right now that's where we are and when uh I have been I think September is the first time when ",
        "2": "I was sort of a boom afraid of booming economy inflation guide to I'm more worried about um growth that I am about inflation and originally I was fourth quarter of 23. I temporarily maybe lost my mind or maybe I was ripe when the Silicon Valley thing happened and got anecdotals and stuff that is traditionally LED like trucks in retail move that up to now I think I'm probably wrong and I'm going to go back to the end of 23 but the real answer is I don't know so recession or no recession though one thing that's interesting and you included a lot of people are very encouraged by certain areas of the market particularly the AI boom there's always stuff to do we had a hard Landing in 74.75 and chemicals and oils and that stuff did great I'm sorry go ahead and answer well do you think that all of AI makes it through this recession or do ",
        "3": "you think that some areas of the market particularly in AI start to look like they're in bubble territory well all of AI is not going to make it through whether we have a recession or not because they haven't separated the wheat from the trash shaft yet but I do believe um unlike crypto I think AI is real it's probably it could be as transformative as the Internet it's a huge thing and I think I've argued publicly that if Staples can go up in price in a recession why can't a company like Nvidia if they go up if they go up if their orders and earnings go up 70 percent in a hard Landing which is what I think would probably happening it's not clear that me that Nvidia goes down despite the Loft evaluation level history has proved if ",
        "4": "you do if you have very good earnings in a recession and they're sustainable if they're not the market somehow figures it out those stocks will do just fine so um we have some lungs we have some shorts and the AIS have sort of dominated the long portfolio for five or six months how do you think about going short in this market our shorts have been fine this year except by in-depth shorts which have been a disaster but we always short the same way I just try and look at the current situation and then I try and think of a situation 12 to 18 months from now based on my forecast and I think if I think the security prices are going to be less um then I short them frankly I'm not sure I've ever made money if I took back the last 40 years I'm afraid to look I've never had a down year but I'm not sure I've made money in shorts I like it ",
        "5": "it's fun but you can get your head handed to you and it's a game that really only professionals and the maths against you if you're if you're dead wrong on a long you can lose a hundred percent if you're dead wrong on a short you can lose 10 times your money and in when I was at Soros I shorted 200 million dollars worth of Internet stocks in March of 99 and in three weeks covered them at a 600 million dollar loss I lost 600 million dollars on a 209 investment in three weeks I was short 12 stocks they all went bankrupt every one of them don't try that at home point when you look at the AI kind of Boom here are there lessons to be learned from the.com Bubble yeah uh their lessons they're definitely lessons to be learned don't get emotional don't get crazy but I will I will say this about the AI ",
        "6": "Nvidia bottomed in October in the low 100s it's true it's 380 or 390 it's a nosebleed territory if this is a secular move if this is if this thing is real you just don't have 10 month moves that's not how it works even the dot Tom bubble lasts in the two two and a half years for many of for many of the guts of the internet it lasted four years the Cisco is the sun micros so could Nvidia go down materially in the short term from any point yes but I would be I would be surprised if I'm right on AI and the impact on it I mean it's already making the top coder seven to eight times seven to eight times more productive than they were five months ago if it's as big as I think it is um Nvidia is something we're going to want to own for at least two or three years not for 10 months ",
        "7": "and maybe longer certainly the top the top are talking about is the promise of China this idea and you know it's time to get your global view here because so many people rely on you for for the macro perspective The View here is that the GDP in China will expand faster than the United States and a lot of investors are kind of shaking off geopolitical tensions on the back of that theory do you see the same promise that the China Bulls are seeing I do not um I was in love with China until about six or seven years ago you go over there and the energy in Shanghai was like New York on crack I mean just it's just fantastic energy the entrepreneurs who are exciting they were into it um and then Xi Jinping did his thing and if you look at China and the rise of China I think it all sort of happened you had this internal capitalist system ",
        "8": "with a bunch of people that act like crazy New Yorkers building new businesses in a dynamic economy but he has proved he's not a capitalist he's definitely not a monopolist there's only room for one monopolist in China in his mind that's him anybody that gets their heads stuck up and I honestly think he either either doesn't understand why China grew and succeeded the way they did or frankly he doesn't care because in terms of staying in power but I would be looking out 10 or 15 years I just don't see it I unless there's a change in power there at the top I think that's going to be a very undynamic economy it's not so much the geopolitical concern I will say this that if I'm right it makes me more fearful of ",
        "9": "military action because that's when dictators become more dangerous is when they've got a divert attention from the immediate problem so what they're doing now is very stimulative we're expecting a sugar high and some kind of robust growth there maybe for six or nine months but looking out I'm I don't I do not look at them as a big challenge in the United States in terms of economic power and growth there's equally been a lot of investor questions about the future of Japan as well how do you think about the opportunity set and how to invest well when I went to Soros Japan like set me off like a rocket ship because I I saw the Nikki at the top and I had everything and then I think every trade I made like five years later and on I've lost money in Japan it's been the biggest value trap in history but I will say right now I I haven't checked this but it's it's by far been the the deepest breadth and the best Market uh ",
        "10": "this year yeah our Market's up I think you said 12 but it's like seven socks and everything else is not even up that's not the case in Japan the breadth is tremendous there you have a couple things going on they look um they look like they're solving deflation plus so you're getting nominal growth they've also it's more than just talk they're really into the whole shareholder value thing and then you got a guy running monetary policy and he sounds like Jerome Powell two years ago I mean inflation's taking off there and he's saying we haven't quite achieved our Golian even though he's like doubled his goal that has stated so you put all that together um for now you have a dynamic Market but given my record trading Japan now the last 15 years you do the opposite of what I sing back to the United States I promised you politics so we're going to get there uh you know because the fiscal will ",
        "11": "overtake the the monetary pretty soon as well especially as we look forward to a 2024 election cycle in the United States and when you look at the wide range of Republican hopefuls uh who are either challenging or May challenge Donald Trump Nikki Haley Chris Christie Mike Pence Ron DeSantis Tim Scott Glenn youngin who has your money and who has your vote um I love Tim Scott I'd like to be the next president whether he has a name recognition whether he's too nice a guy for this fight I don't know but um I'm not really into dividers I'd like to see the country United and I think from that party he's the one that could probably most accomplish that um I'm kind of excited about Chris Christie taking on Donald Trump the other's kind of like dance around the subject they don't even use his name I think somebody needs to ",
        "12": "hit him in the mouth with the way he hits people in their mouth and Chris Christie could be very good at that I was very disappointed the way he handled the 2016 thing um for those who don't know it on National Television I said that Donald Trump had the um economic understanding of a kindergarten of the U.S economy on national television with John Kasich and then I came a year later and said I overestimated his economic standings so just just just so you were now oh no but anyway um I don't think Chris Christie can win but I'm excited that he's getting in the race because I think he can maybe expose Donald Trump and he really needs to be exposed especially Ron DeSantis I you know the way that he has approached corporations in Florida in particular what do you think that means for him as he enters the race ",
        "13": "I actually think until recently he did a great job in Florida if if you look at the record um he's very smart um not that broad in terms of the people around him he'd have to build that going in um but despite his intelligence it seems like his calculus is to go after the Trump voters I don't think the Trump voters care about policy I don't think they can be moved and by going after the Trump voters he's alienating the other 30 to 40 percent of the pie particularly women and others that care a lot about the social issues he's not my he's not my favorite but um frankly if he ran against Joe Biden I vote for him enthusiastically I wonder you define yourself as an independent as well is there anybody in the and you voted for Democrats in the past is there anyone in the Democratic party ",
        "14": "that excites you well I'd love it if Gina raimondo would run but apparently we're going to put an 80 year old who's going on 100 up on the ticket I I don't understand what the Democrats are doing I voted for two Democrats out of the last five elections I'm not like some partisan crazy person but what are they doing um so you know I don't know I don't know there doesn't seem to be anybody other than Bobby Kennedy who's willing to take him on Bobby Kennedy is a little nuts but mark my words he's going to scare this guy because when people go to the polls particularly a year from now because Joe Biden is a moving puck I wouldn't be surprised if if Bobby Kennedy doesn't get more support than any of us could imagine you know democrat or republican the kind of trajectory you pointed at at the very beginning of this higher spending no ",
        "15": "matter what no matter what scenario we're in in the next couple of years in the United States do you think investors will be facing much higher taxes eventually outside for a hedge um yeah the only the only way out of this is I mean given what I talked about earlier taxes are going to be much higher in 20 years if it's a Republican president can they hold out for a few more years I assume so but taxes are going up it's either that or you know 30 or 40 inflation which I don't think is going to happen so before I let you go I know you won't perfect me on this with a lot of specific Ally I know I had any perfect answer well what is the fat pitch you've been saying that you have been kind of cautious when it comes to markets at what point do you start to get in and you start to have a conviction trade that is much bigger I think my record ",
        "16": "is as much knowing not when to play as when to play and because I deal in five or six different asset classes I've had the luxury if there's uncertainty inequities usually that's a good time for bonds and currencies they're doing crazy things when the world's blowing up so there's a lot of volatility there and I I would love to answer your question but this is the most complicated non-road map unanalyzable situation I've ever seen in terms of having a lot of confidence in an economic prediction going forward so I honestly and I hate not to answer questions I honestly don't see a fat pitch right now what I do think is given the change in liquidity giving everything I've outlined some really fat pitches are going to emerge in say the ",
        "17": "next eight to 24 months and I don't want to blow my cash and being being a horrible mental state being down eight percent making a big bet on something that I didn't have amazing conviction on when I think the road map is going to be good so um you talked to me about this interview in January I probably wouldn't have accepted it if I knew that I was going to be as messed up in the head as I am right now in June but uh I also thought it would be bad to cancel [Laughter] so I don't have a fat pitch but I hope uh I hope I've imparted something to your audience yeah absolutely we will ask you again in eight months you said thank you so much thank you appreciate it ",
        "18": "[Applause] [Music] so welcome everyone and thank you very much Adina for spending time with us today it's a hard act to follow that really was but you can do it if anybody you can do the noise Reliance 10 to tell us what's on his mind exactly uh so um let me start with those basic thing I actually as I mentioned you looked you up on Wikipedia today and it said NASDAQ is a Securities Exchange which I guess it is but I think you have a larger Vision tell me what you see NASDAQ as being today sure while NASDAQ is a Securities Exchange but that is and that is our foundation but today we really are a technology company that serves the global Capital Market so we have our own exchanges and it's a very technology ",
        "19": "driven part of our business but we also then have really deepened our relationships across corporates investors Market participants and other exchanges with technology so we provide the technology to 130 other exchanges around the world we serve about 5 000 asset managers and asset owners with insights and intelligence to help them make smart asset allocation decisions we also provide corporates with a lot of tools that'll enable them to be better Public public companies and then we have our anti-financial crime Suite that really supports the banks and Brokers around the world so today we've really taken that foundation and really extended and expanded our relationships with our clients through technology so goodness knows Tech is the byword right now for just about every company and a lot of those asset managers and corporates and financial institutions have a fair amount of Technology themselves so what do they do and what do you do what do you add to what they already are doing or want to do right well I think that it's really important to recognize that workflows you know the world has become a lot more complicated ",
        "20": "and therefore we have to find ways to enable them to do their jobs better more efficiently as well as to give them better access to insights to it and that's really a data part a data play so to have allow them to have better data better workflow tools to be efficient and and smarter in making those decisions so with regard to asset managers and asset owners we provide a tool that connects the asset measures that asset owners together so NASA owner would say I'm really interested in the strategy I want to understand who's out there who has funds that I can invest in in that strategy how what's their performance what's their management team you know how they done how do I make sure that I'm I'm able to allocate assets into that strategy so that's called investment Nazi investment and then on top of that we then provide those asset owners with portfolio management tools that allow them to manage their portfolio is very dynamic organically so it's a it's that's just one example I think as you know in the anti-fin crime Suite we have a complete end-to-end solution to manage fraud and AML detection investigation and ",
        "21": "reporting for banks and then of course within the exchange business we provide our core technology to exchanges all over the world yeah and I want to get to the financial crimes issue because it's a very big issue that you're you're very active in but before that how much of what you're providing NASDAQ is providing is if I can put it to the pipeline the connectivity and how much of it is the add-on the of the Analytics I think certainly within the exchange business itself it's connectivity and then of course the interaction of those orders within our exchange business within our workflow tools and analytics tools it's a lot of intelligence so it's really what we do with certainly both with Nazi investment and with verifin is they're both cloud-based tools we pool data together across thousands of Institutions and we then are able to run very very Advanced algorithms and analytics on on them both for asset allocation decisions in one one use case and then for anti-financial Crime Management in the other use case and so we are very Tech forward it's all very modern technology and we are now running ",
        "22": "AI algorithms I'm really focused on that in our anti-financial crime suite and starting to figure out how to leverage that over in our other on our other businesses as well because I think a lot of financial institutions have invested an awful lot in technology particularly the Big Money Center Banks how much of your business is with some of the smaller Banks and financial institutions as opposed to the big guys who do it in-house well I actually more and more the big banks are looking looking for outside technology Partners which obviously accrues to our benefit but but with with verifin we started and that's our anti-financial crime technology we started with the smallest Banks actually you know in a way you have to think about every bank has a responsibility to manage manage out fraud manage that money laundering and be really good great at it and at the same time they don't all have the same resources to do it so with the smaller Banks um verifin really started there to say we can provide you a single platform end-to-end fraud and AML detection across all of your payments whether it's wires checks ACH all of those capabilities as well as and they look at every transaction and ",
        "23": "the reason why they're more successful than others is that they then pulled the data so instead of just looking at that one bank's transactions they pull that data into 25 a pool of 2500 Banks now where they're able to look at you know patterns of behavior across all of the banks when criminals don't just Bank in One bank so they leave little data crumbs across the system and verifin is we think the best in the world to be able to root out those criminals through their algorithms we now are going up to the largest banks so the largest banks have used traditional on-prem Technology Solutions from outside firms or they've built their own capabilities but they're realizing that the problems becoming more and more complex and again criminals don't just bank with them so if they're able to leverage the data that we have and Leverage The workflow tools we have they'll be more effective so we now we signed our first tier one Bank um last quarter and we're running a lot of pocs where we can show the benefit of this um this technology across this tier ones and we're getting ",
        "24": "more more squarely into the tier two Banks now we can't have a discussion with technology where they talk about artificial intelligence uh and it's been around for a while actually but certainly since chat GPT really a great marketing move by the way yes it is I open AI but we all talk about it tell me what you're doing right now in terms of the modernization of the markets with AI already and where do you see it going I mean first of all we have been leveraging AI within NASDAQ verifin has been using it for several years and there it's really kind of advanced algorithms self-learning algorithms getting smarter and smarter and identifying patterns of behavior and so we're able to learn from them as to how they've been able to integrate that into their product suite and into their product development Suite to make it so it's more effective at NASDAQ we actually um are asking the SEC to approve our first AI driven order type within NASDAQ and and a big part of that is we have billions and billions of messages that flow through our systems every day about you know anywhere from I would say 60 to 80 billion messages a day so it is we ",
        "25": "have a big data pool and what we're trying to do is structure order types that give institutional investors better fill rates so we have a certain kind of order type called a midpoint extended life order a little technical but it allows it's a time there's a timer on the order it actually introduces latency to create a pool of liquidity you know it's kind of segmented within the market and um and what we're trying to do is see what is the optimal timer on that order that maximizes the fill rate at stock by stock level and we we evaluate about 175 different characteristics of the market to try to identify what is the right timer each stock by stock and it updates every 30 seconds so it's a good kind of self-learning tool for the market to create a better experience for our investors you know we'll see um you know that's just the first foray but a big part of our strategy also is bringing our marks to the cloud and that's a foundation because the more you can put your your capabilities into a more ",
        "26": "scalable more resilient kind of infrastructure and the more you can use their tooling the more the smarter we can get with our technology tell us about that SEC approval that you're seeing talking because one of the issues a lot of excitement about AI some trepidation but one of the issues is is it right because we hear all these anecdotes about really wonderful things that are just flat wrong coming in right a generative AI what does the SEC put you through to make sure what you're using gets it right because in financial transactions you got to be right yeah I mean I think first of all with an order type that what I just described we're able to demonstrate what all the inputs how all the inputs generate an output right it's a self-learning mechanism but it's a very defined package you know of of AI algorithms so we are able to show explainability of the model and I think that's going to be a core underpinning of early AI implementation in the markets however you know when it comes to anti-financial Crime I think that's where we have to unlock the potential of the AI to help manage crime and my view is criminals they have they don't follow rules and they don't follow laws and ",
        "27": "they're going to use the best technology available so if if they are able to use tools that are even more advanced that may not be totally explainable but get them to an outcome that they're looking for to take advantage of the system I think that the the banks and Brokers they have to be able to leverage those same tools to combat those criminals and so we are asking Regulators to think more broadly about how to leverage the next generation of AI which is not is easily explainable to be able to find patterns of behavior and root out criminal Behavior so we're hopeful that they can kind of look at use case specific ways of of identifying how how the guard rail should be applied let's talk about financial crime something that's very much in your mind you've written about it just recently actually they're not bad piece about it one of the things I learned from that is how big it is it and how little it's detected give us some statistics on that yeah well there's about four trillion dollars of money that's estimated to be a launder through the financial system globally and only about one percent of that is really caught and so that means ",
        "28": "that it is a massive problem for for the world economy it's also you know and very frankly the banks are being put on the front lines to come back this problem and yet so they have to have the best tooling available to do that I think what we're what we're challenging The Regulators to think about is number one as I said you know criminals don't just Bank in One Bank in the United States we're allowed to pull data into a third-party kind of container to allow for banks to pull the data to look for criminal Behavior across the system but in Europe that is not allowed in Canada that's that's just starting to be allowed I mean and and so therefore they're really hamstrung and they can only look at their own transactions to try to find criminals I think that's number one number two putting more AI algorithms and kind of unleashing the power of the next-gen technology to find those patterns of behavior so you can root out the criminals as number two and then number three is a feedback loop you know Regulators receive probably millions of what they call SARS reports which are suspected ",
        "29": "um suspect you know suspicion of criminal activity by the Banks but they don't ever tell the bank yes this was in fact criminal to act or not if we had that that feedback loop back from The Regulators we could then make the algorithms either even smarter we could say oh we've got validation that this was a real criminal act so let's make sure that we can use that to kind of be smarter with the next the next Stars report so that gives me a good sense of where we are today where are we going start with Europe first of all is there a real movement toward allowing some Consortium data sharing to get past that problem you described yeah and that's the way to say it it's Consortium data sharing and the answer is that there are some rules being proposed to allow for banks to start to share data within the EU and within the UK um so I think that that's a really important development and of course you know there are privacy concerns but the fact is that there are new technologies that today that where you can take that data in and encrypt it in a way that makes it so that you're only using the data that you need to find the right you know that specific type of behavior ",
        "30": "you're not having to expose pii from bank to bank in any way you're you're basically maintaining the the Integrity of the Privacy while still being able to leverage the right amount of data in an encrypted fashion to root out the criminals so if that's Europe come back to the United States as you said there is some permission to have some sharing among banks in the United States about this data at the same time there are issues about Ai and approval AI actually to sort out the financial crimes as I understand it what are the problems there yeah I mean I think that the fact is that we end up the banks end up putting in as I said so many different suspected reports of activity without that feedback loop back to say um this is real this is not because the more that we can tune the engine the better we can tune it the better more effective we're going to be and a big part of it is reducing false positives right the banks have to have an army of people to look at every single you know pattern that is suspected and then they they have all these false positives they have to walk through the great thing about verifin is that we're able to reduce false positives by 25 to 50 ",
        "31": "percent within the banks because of the use of the Consortium data and the algorithm and the AI algorithms but now even still if we had even more of a feedback loop we could make them even more efficient I mean it is a very unfortunately still a very inefficient process you describe what the SEC is putting you through to get approval of your AI in a very different part of the forest how does that apply to financial crimes are you going to have to go through a similar process and does it work as well it's not quite as specific about inputs and outputs yeah so I would say that with regard to anti it's a different regulator so it's kind of the OCC the fed and others and they actually require the banks to have complete explainability of their models so are they that's an expectation that they have we have to we have to prove to the banks they do diligence on us we have to prove to them that we can prove explainability in order for them to feel comfortable using our system and that's where I think we we want to engage with The Regulators to say what's the next generation of AI going to do that's going to make it even more effective and therefore maybe it's not totally explainable but you understand that we're not using it we're using it for ",
        "32": "the right purpose and so changing the regulatory I would say process around the use of AI is going to be an important next step for every industry and certainly for the financial industry we are a data driven industry we are probably the most data one well one of the most data-driven Industries in the world we're also kind of on the front lines of technology in many many regards so if they can work with us to kind of figure out how to use these the right the technology the right way I think it could become a blueprint for other Industries as you seek ways to help financial institutions other customers get their work done part of that work right now has to do with ESG what role can you play with respect to data again talking about data when it comes to environmental social and governance yeah so we actually provide corporate with tools that help them manage those programs a lot more efficiently so you know corporates are having to deal with different rating agencies taxonomies investor expectations there's no uniform you know approach to it there's no uniform there's even no uniform taxonomy around it and and that's very confusing ",
        "33": "for corporates and it's frankly very labor-intensive and expensive for corporates so what we look at is on our role as an exchange operator is to really help corporates navigate the public markets more effectively and and efficiently so we've actually built um we've bought two small companies that have built these tools to help with ESG generalized reporting put it in one container and then we map it to all the taxonomies and all the rating agencies that are out there and and also one that's very focused on environmental so we have one that's more General one that's focused on environmental and all of the sustainability metrics that companies need to put forth we think that that makes it so that they can be more efficient and effective and then we actually have an advice advisory team that helps them figure out how to communicate the right way with investors to make it so investors can give them the credit that they're that they're owed for the programs they have so we're not trying to take a stand on it we're just trying to make it so that corporates can navigate it more effectively and actually it's one of the it is the fastest growing tool within ",

        "35": "and the way that we evaluate it on the basis of very discrete listing standards as well as governance standards and we do kind of do a governance overlay do they have proper Independence do they have you know is the board composition appropriate for the risk that they're taking you know or do they have an independent audit committee things like that and then they come on SO in this particular case where you have you have um you know some changes in the risk factors I think that the question is are they disclosing those risk factors and that's really a job for the SEC to evaluate at the same time do you have to independently take a look at it now given the fact you're around we would actually work with finra and the SEC so it's a very collaborative relationship across finra and the SEC in that context okay Adina thank you so much really great to have you there's Adina Friedman she's the chair and CEO of NASDAQ thank you thank you ",

        "41": "we're able to fill the Gap and and do things secondly uh we bought several companies that we just did all equity and we'll Finance later when rates come come down and we've got plenty of equity Capital we'll buy them with just which equity and so what you're going to see I think is a sustained period of time uh where the capital markets will stay tighter it is not to date a credit issue could become a credit issue but it's not there yet it's more of a liquidity issue right now as to why you're not seeing as many uh private Equity deals done I want to get in based on what you just said get into a little bit of the guts of KKR because what you just described is a very different firm from what you and Jerry Goldberg and your cousin George Roberts started in 1976. 95 of the money that you raised last year was not private Equity it was all in those areas that you described and more ",
        "42": "how would you describe this firm right now well I think you have to go back a little bit and understand uh the the most important conversation that jury George and I had in 1976 and that was what kind of culture did we want to have and it was very important to us to have a culture where everybody was included in everything we did that meant that everyone was paid for uh and got part of the carried interest part of the fee income because all we did when we started was Private Equity whether you worked on a deal or you didn't whether you were a partner at the firm or you were not a partner at the firm fast forward 47 years we have 26 offices around the world maybe 40 45 different products that we have at KKR today ranging all the way from every kind of credit product infrastructure real estate uh private Equity growth Equity Etc um and today it is exactly the same ",
        "43": "culture everyone at the firm gets to participate in everything we do so that means that if I came in to see you and you're the CEO of a company that used to be all we could talk about is your company for sale today let's get to know you we are very big Believers that people do business with people they like and trust and so Bill build a relationship and that's really how we go about it and then eventually you find out because everyone at take care has a tool kit they find out that wow this company needs to redo their balance sheet this one wants to make an acquisition but they don't have the banks covering them anymore because we're in a tighter credit situation Etc we're able to be able to provide Capital up and down the capital structure so yes that is correct that last year about 95 percent of the money we raised which was somewhere ",
        "44": "in the 75 80 billion dollar range was non-private equity and the reason for that was we had finished raising large private Equity uh pools of capital already so that money was used for uh for climate for ESG for real estate for credit all kinds of credit and for infrastructure so uh today we're very Diversified for firm able to be a Solutions provider to many companies anywhere in the world and that's really was by Design what George and I and and Joe Bay and and Scott nuttle really worked on over the years one of the interesting things that you've gotten into and Joe Bay the the co-ceo talked about this a couple weeks ago or in the in the last week or two was getting into the the high net worth uh area uh a new fund related to that I mean this has been long been the Holy Grail a holy grail for for folks in the alternative ",
        "45": "investment business talk about that opportunity if you will Jason that's a huge opportunity first of all uh in the high net worth areas about 178 trillion dollars of of uh of capital uh net worth uh uh income Etc today one percent of that is in the alternative space invested so think about that if you just got to three to five percent what does that mean that's trillions of dollars that will be able to go into the uh the alternative space where I talk about alternative what I'm saying is that's private Equity that's infrastructure that's real estate uh it's maybe private credit Etc and so we have come up with democratized products across the board uh here um and uh we're working with different registered advisors and getting on ",
        "46": "different platforms to sell these different uh products this is fairly new for us but uh initial reaction so far has been very strong because if I if we'd have this conversation 10 years ago and you said to me do you think that KKR will ever be dealing with the high net worth a population I'd say in a small way but today we're now able to deal with the high net worth population globally in a very major way and that's going to change the complexion these are pools of capital that will you know be fairly well tied up for five years at least if not longer and we're going to I hope take advantage of the opportunities there today so one of the things that's going on at the firm you're now a year or so year ",
        "47": "and change I believe into a pretty major transition which is your job has changed you hand you and George handed off the CEO rolls to Scott nuttallen and Joe Bay so what's your job like now well first of all I'm glad after 45 years to finally get promoted so I'm really happy about that so George Roberts and I uh we both founded the firm with Jerry kohlberg and uh for 45 years George and I were co-ceos and we're now co-executive chairman we meet officially once a week with Joe and Scott we help them think through strategy they're running the business this is uh you know given to their uh to them and by the way this took a lot of thought on George's in my part this didn't we didn't wake up one night and say okay let's just pick some people out of the air we actually ",
        "48": "uh started with about seven people that we thought possibly could do the job narrowed it down to three people that was over a seven year period and what we did then was to make Joe Bay and Scott nettle co-chief operating officers in I believe about 2017. George and I stayed as co-ceos and we kept giving more and more responsibility to them let's see how they do and they did a phenomenal job particularly during covet there The Firm grew dramatically during that period of time and they performed magnificently they showed real leadership now picking two people I've heard over and over again I know two people never worked yes we've got lots of examples where two people don't work at KKR you know George and I grew up together we're uh four months apart in age we met when we were two were first cousins and best friends and uh that's ",
        "49": "the best partnership you could have so what we saw in Joe and Scott was the fact that they came into the firm together probably 25 26 years ago now um grew through the firm together and their families are best friends but there was one piece that we focused on very much obviously they've got capability of leadership did they believe in and live by our culture and that was critical because if we lose the culture at KKR this culture of inclusion everybody participating we lose our DNA and they live by it and so that was a very important part George and I've always believed that if you because we're often asked how did you make it work so well uh and by the way uh you two must fight ",
        "50": "a lot oh yeah we had uh I think we had a terrible fight we both were seven and he he wanted to ride my new bicycle he had just come up to Tulsa from Houston for Christmas I got in his new bike and I got chased in the house because I wanted to ride the bike first I wasn't a very good host and I ran in the corner of a wall and cracked my head open and I had 26 stitches that's the last fight we've had there's no reason to fight go bust your head open so so uh we uh uh who says Wall Street isn't a contact sport come on that's right so um in in Joe and Scott we saw many of the same characteristics and same friendship and camaraderie with their families and and the two of them that George and I have and so it became Pretty Natural for them to then succeed us but you know we built this over a long period of time because we always said we wanted a firm that survived long ",
        "51": "after George and Henry were gone and it contained the same DNA that we've been able to build uh for many years in the past one of the things I always like to ask you about is New York City because you've been a steward of this place since you came to Columbia business school back in the day you've been very involved from a Civic philanthropic and obviously business perspective what do you see in New York City right now you've moved to Hudson yards the firm is now located there what does New York City feel like at this moment you know Wildfire is notwithstanding no no I I worry about New York and I think it's going to take a long time because we have something today that we didn't have before and that's the aftermath of covid of just getting people back to work now I'm happy to say that at KKR we got people back uh about two years ago and what we said was we're a uh a an apprentice model people learn from each other so we ",
        "52": "expect you to come back in and they did now it didn't hurt in New York for example the fact that we had a brand new office we had great food and people uh wanted to be together and you learn from each other one of our biggest challenges in New York and the challenge for mayor Adams is going to be to get people back into the office and that's going to be tough it still isn't happening yet it's better than it was so that's one worry the second worry that I have is just crime um you know I wish that uh the mayor and uh and others in in the government could figure out a way to be much more focused on penalties for people that commit crimes you didn't go into stores and take up to a thousand dollars and not much happens to you if anything that's wrong and so we've got to I think start getting tougher on crime and it's like a broken windows Theory you know one window gets broken now it's broken ",
        "53": "pretty soon a whole neighborhood's gone well that's what's happened here in part so I think this whole turnaround of New York it can happen I love New York I've lived here since 1967 and coming from Oklahoma but I think it's just going to take a long time to get back to where we should be all right well as we start to wind down a little bit I have to ask you about a very important topic golf um you're a very good golfer I know that from a number of people including my boss and your friend don't believe everything here um you're a deal maker we saw a hell of a deal yesterday uh putting the PGA and lived together at least on a commercial basis as a deal maker and a golfer what do you make of it look I don't know all the details and there's my bet is there's a lot more than what the headlines say that the fine print is is really important ",
        "54": "but I think getting together is the best thing for golf this fight that was going on and the lawsuits that were outraging in uh one side the golfers from live and uh you know taking shots at the PGA and vice versa that's not constructive for the game uh you know golf for a while was very flat years ago Tiger Woods got into the game and all of a sudden uh you know the number of participants in golf uh increased by two three million participants and then it started back down so the worst thing yes it sort of makes interesting reading but it is not constructive so I would say this is constructive as I say I don't know all the fine print the details but I'm very happy that they've gotten this behind them you've got some very capable people on the PGA side that are on the board there headed by Ed Hurley he and Jimmy Dunns on that board they know a lot ",
        "55": "about Golf and they're deal makers they know how to get things done so when I saw the headlines come across I couldn't be happier that this is I hope now behind us and we're going to be able to go forward with the game of golf because the game of golf is not just what you see on the TV or just the pros it's all of us that go out on weekends and and get a chance to knock the ball around and as you reflect on on where you are I mean we've talked a little bit about succession we've talked a little bit about what you're doing um what energizes you at this point from a business perspective or or even personally I mean this is this is a pretty remarkable chapter that you've entered into well I happen to love where I am right now um first of all uh I'm asked from time to time so what drives me well for years what's Driven me into they it's exactly the same if not even more so is curiosity I don't think that anyone can ",
        "56": "be a great investor unless you're curious but you got to be curious about a lot of things it's not just the stock or the stock market if if I took people to the window uh on and our office and we go from 74 to 80 and said look out what do you see out there I hope that they would say I see possibility as opposed to I see the tugboat in the Hudson River you've got to see opportunity and see where connect the dots and so what drives me so much today really is curiosity I'm spending a lot of time which I've done since 1998 but I did it out of my back pocket in the Venture startup world we didn't do it at KKR so I was able to do that today I built that up significantly and having a lot of fun meeting with young companies uh entrepreneurs Etc that's fun secondly I'm very involved in an organization called sponsors for Educational ",

        "80": "thank you for joining us my pleasure there are as you all know a lot of long-term questions I have for you but I figured the first place that we start giving your view of the Financial Health of so many Americans how do you think about the next six to 12 months as they navigate this macro environment that looks to be facing a recession yeah well again it's a pleasure to be here when I think about the overall economy right now clearly it's strong when you look at the underlying fundamentals we're in a strong economy but there's some real headwinds when you think about inflation when you think about rates continuing to rise when you think about the broader geopolitical environment we still are battling a war Etc so what does that mean in terms of what we're seeing we do anticipate a mild recession the latter part of the Year going into the first quarter but I think what's most important as someone who runs a company that exists to ensure millions of Americans can have a Secure Retirement what we are seeing right now and what we ",
        "81": "will expect to continue to see is that 25 of Americans have reduced their contribution towards their retirement plan and within that 25 50 have taken it down to zero and so when you think about an environment where rates are so high inflation is so high it has real short term but also long-term impacts as we think about what that will mean for millions of Americans on their path to having um you know confidence in their retirement you know it's interesting you see a very different view when the banks think about savings and deposit rates going up the reality too is you're seeing Americans not only contribute less but dip into their retirement and it's a real problem I mean just to kind of anchor on some key stats there's a four trillion dollar savings Gap in our country we know that 40 percent of Americans run out of money we know that women retire with 30 percent less than when you look at people of color 54 of African Americans are not saying enough to retire and so when you think about ",
        "82": "that backdrop and when you hear stats that within that today people are taking down their contribution and some are depleting it will have a long-term impact that I would say we're in a crisis as we think about real risk for the average American it's interesting let's talk about the here and now because if you look on Wall Street people say Okay inflation is coming down it's coming down but it's still high yes and you know actually I want to pull up a poll here to kind of talk a little bit about whether we've even seen the worst effects of them the questions are is will there be aftershocks are we in the clear or are there new problems coming when you look at the inflationary picture for Americans is that the result I've never been in a room with senses yeah no but we'll let people here we'll answer a little more I think this new problems are coming it's an interesting uh idea here you know let alone if we're out of the woods or not I mean the idea that we're still in a prolonged inflationary ",
        "83": "environment how is that impacting consumers in particular because you know Wall Street doesn't really get a view of the whole consumer picture here yeah I mean if you just think about the everyday needs of people how they are filling up their gas tank the price of food the cost of clothes whatever that is that impacts their overall Financial picture and so when you hear stubborn inflation inflation is still high we're already seeing the impact on the average consumer to have people go into their retirement plan and reduce their contribution because they're making an impossible trade-off is a concern and when you think about what does that mean that means they're taking income that they're going to get taxed on so that dollar is not a full dollar and they're losing pounding value over decades so the real question for us is when people are making those tough choices today specifically in a high inflationary environment how do we make sure that as we're navigating through this cycle that they can get back on track so it's not ",
        "84": "just about the here and the now and the decision that an average American is making today it is also about what do we do to help that average American get back on track to make sure that they can make better investment choices through the long term in order to make sure that they can have a Secure Retirement I do want to get into this idea of what companies and the government can do about this problem but before I get there I want to kind of outly outline the the disparities we see here there's this sense out there that inflation is not impacting everybody equally so what does that look like when you look at you know the American demographic and what are the Ripple effects of that type of widening inequality well I mean we know and history has told us is that we're whenever we are in an environment of economic uncertainty it can have an exasperated impact in different for different populations particularly people of color and again when you look at the first stat 40 of all Americans and then you have 58 54 of African Americans we know the impact for women retirement 30 percent less ",
        "85": "these issues compound and one of the fundamental questions I think we all ask ourselves that are committed in wanting to close the economic Gap the inequalities well if we are not dealing with the long-term implications for retirement then that debt is being transferred to their children those issues become compounding Which is less disposable income to put back into the economy because you're taking care of Mom or Dad's basic needs so I do think it's an issue that we all have to understand and address and understand the decisions that people are making today how will that impact decisions tomorrow how does that have a disproportionate impact in people of color in women and then what decisions do we need to make in policy as well as in business to have better outcomes it's interesting that you put the burden transfer generationally there are some that would also say that that burden also gets transferred to the US government yes we started today talking a lot about kind of the US debt load how unsustainable it is you know how do you ",
        "86": "think about the response ability of governments here versus corporations when you think about Americans Financial Health well I don't look at it as an or I look at it as an end you know we know that good policy matters especially when you're thinking about long-term investment Solutions and when you ask the question about social security we know that Social Security was never designed to be the full replacement for someone's retirement but the reality is a large percentage of Americans are relying on almost 90 percent of Social Security to cover all of their financial needs which is not sufficient and so when I think about the role I think about it in a couple Dimensions one we need Social Security and so hopefully we'll we'll figure out how to address the entitlement and what does that mean but there's real risk that it could be less and we also know that we have longevity risk in our country people are living longer which will put another strain on the government and so as we think about business as we think about the investment Community as I think about a CEO being the CEO of Tia I think about how do we look at the allocation ",
        "87": "and talk about low-cost implant annuities as part of that overall portfolio when you think about not just stocks and bonds but you think about guaranteed income in a low-cost way I think about what employers can do to say are we do we have a strong 401k or 403 b plan but it's not enough to say that we have those benefits I think we also have to ask the question are all of our employees participating in the plan at all levels are they all enrolling and are they all increasing that percentage so that they can have confidence that they have enough coupled with Social Security and then coupled with their broader Investment Portfolio so good policy matters and I am encouraged when you think about secure act 1.0 and 2.0 it was bipartisan so we need more bipartisan conversations because this is an American issue and then we also need business to continue to make sure that the plans that we are providing for our workers are working hard for them while ",
        "88": "they're working so that they can have confidence later that they can have a security title how much of this is a call to action for the private sector to step it up if you're running a business there are a lot of things you're thinking about right now I think it's a big question the good news is we all know that business matters when it comes to health benefits when it comes to retirement benefits we understand the importance it's not just the wages it's also about the benefits that we provide in order to be able to attract and retain talent and so it is a call to action it's a call to action because we know with all the great work that business has done it's not sufficient when the outcome is 40 and so when I think about basic practical steps I would suggest a few things one make sure that the plan is working investing in your 401k plan or 403b plan Auto enroll Auto escalate one percent every year to get to that maximum contribution clearly the employee has the option if they need to opt out but the next year you opt them back in and we know studies show ",
