        "1": "Brian um I think I did I did get your hair cut but I have the stronger beard I think you um uh you and I see eye to eye on a lot of things be uh Beyond haircut and one of the most important things that I think coinbase has has taken the lead on and maybe not gotten enough credit on is um is everything that you've done on the policy side the last 18 months uh coinbase is a public company the first major public company in crypto um you've been secure in kind of a trusted brand since day one in the industry you have uh been very vocal in a positive way on and and I think right on some of the values oriented policy issues like how do we maintain censorship resistance while also making sure that we protect consumers and and you know kind of abide by the existing of of uh the the spirit of existing consumer protections law and and kind of fair and efficient markets ",
        "2": "why do you think the media doesn't see the same thing uh and and do you think that you get the short end of the six sometimes is there something that is like a misconception or are we just in this Perpetual cycle of they build you up to tear you down because um I think there's a disconnect between how this room feels about coinbase which is very positive and then some of the last 12 18 months some of the the public perception that you've had to battle on the media yeah well it started off with the good questions I guess um look I mean yeah coinbase has been around a long time and I think I've started to shift our point of view over time of not just trying to build coinbase but how do we actually go out there and be a champion for the whole industry and defend the whole industry right and as you mentioned I mean we've always tried to be the most trusted brand you know make products that are easy to use to get more and more people into crypto but you know sometimes people get confused if you're the most trusted brand you know why are you funding these lawsuits you know versus the treasury or why do I sometimes get into these unfortunate ",
        "3": "tweets you know with people um and the way that I try to think about that is um you know we're trying to be the most trusted to our customers right and I think 95 of the time that is aligned 100 with being the most you know the most compliant and being the most trusted to various policy makers and governments around the world but you know five percent of the time we see something kind of bad happen where we see something that's not treating crypto fairly or it's prohibiting Innovation or it's exceeding Authority and those are the moments where I kind of do feel like coinbase has a bit of an obligation to defend the industry and fund uh some of these pushbacks so um I hope that Nuance is not completely lost I agree in mainstream media sometimes um you know Nuance is completely lost and it's and it becomes a little bit of a they're just looking for anybody to fight and you know great crazy headlines um also if you're if you're the leader you tend to get some more um more hate as well and we kind of went out first as a public company but look we're just we're just one other company building this movement it's much more about crypto space broadly than anything ",
        "4": "coinbase is doing at this point how's your perspective changed being a public company CEO because I think there is more scrutiny maybe on coinbase versus some other companies in the space because you are public and you have that added level of scrutiny but the market has also just gotten an order of magnitude bigger again it's more liquid it's on the institutional radar so I think the stakes are higher as well um is it the market increasing in value that has changed your perspective or has your perspective changed or is it mostly just driven by the the public scrutiny from the uh the the stock being listed yeah well before I decided to go public uh with coinbase take company public I did a bunch of research I went out and talked to a bunch of CEOs who either had gone a public route or some of them who had decided to stay private or handed the reins over to somebody else and I tried to get a little bit of a rundown of what are the pros and the cons and you know look I'll tell you the pros um one thing is that it definitely has put us on the main stage you know so to ",
        "5": "speak where we're able to get deals done with BlackRock and companies like meta now and you know we're the first kind of abortion 500 company that's doing crypto and so we can kind of go do deals with other Fortune 500 companies now and they sort of treat us more uh as a more legitimate Force out there the amount of you know attention the positive and negative has been has been much bigger and that's been fine it's also easier to raise money as a public company at least last year it was now the markets are a little different but you know for instance we raised uh three billion dollars of debt last year and at very attractive rates and that whole process took one week and I didn't do a single meeting our CFO literally just went out to the public markets the debt markets and we had the money in our account one week later which was pretty crazy because as a private company you know fundraising is really hard um and by the way it hasn't been that different different my job I mean I do an earnings call every quarter and things like that and I go meet with public market investors but I was kind of meeting with private Market investors too and that part hasn't been as different I'd say the downside is you know like you get a mark to Market every every day as a public company and you know I think some in the private Market ",
        "6": "sometimes you may not see that things have come down a bit but we felt it pretty pretty quickly this year um and I do think some of the scrutiny is uh not like that helpful to be honest it's just people you know pushing their own narrative or um trying to do like anti-tech biased pieces or whatever uh opinion pieces that are actually they should be labeled opinion pieces but they're not there's various things like that that we encounter as well but I I don't think we get our unfair share I think that's true of all crypto by the way it's not that's not specific to coinbase so there's the famous Bezos uh quote of in the short term maybe it's Warren Buffett maybe I'm conflating billionaires but uh the in the short short term Market is a voting machine long term it's a weighing machine right what's what's unique is yes you are the first big IPO and kind of public company in the in the US in the space but there's a ton of these assets a ton of these communities a ton of Founders that have tokens affiliated with their projects or the protocols that have have dealt with this um just uh chaotic you know extreme ",
        "7": "volatility for years and in some cases several Cycles how do you manage that transition uh from uh from your your team from your Community when when things are going well they're going really well and it's like you can do no wrong and then obviously the market corrects maybe it over corrects and you got to keep people focused on the weighing machine uh component of the market versus the the euphoric highs yeah I think you know every crypto company has and actually not even just crypto I mean Tech broadly kind of came down a lot like Netflix that was down 80 or whatever right yep it's not just a crypto thing but everyone's kind of learning a bit about resilience and leadership in these moments and you know a couple things I always remind myself of is like you know human psychology is is very interesting it's like hardwired into our our brains and we kind of have um like a Reptilian Brain and a mammalian brain and then the neocortex which only humans have and you know our mammalian brain is kind of hardwired with all this stuff like a flight response right and it's imagine you're ",
        "8": "an animal on the on the Prairie or whatever and one of the animals gets spooked and starts to run off well you know you we all have an instinct to run with that animal even if they got spooked by nothing because you don't want to be the last one around there if some Predator shows up so um the same thing happens to human beings in these in in public markets right like where you see someone get spooked and then everyone gets spooked and then we all kind of have this herd mentality so I always try to think about all right separate out my my mammalian brain or whatever that thing is that's causing these fight or flight responses and what's the neocortex thinking right now you know actually it's sort of a weird comment but I try to actually compartmentalize it right and um you know you know you were talking about in the last session just about the contrarian bets right and so Ironically in these moments when things are down it's the best time to to buy in the metaphorical sense um build and you know invest in the future and when things are up and up and up it's like it's maybe irrational exuberant and it's the best maybe you should be in the opposite of that so I always try to think about how I can introduce this contrarian ",
        "9": "um thinking and and also just think or think longer term you know um there's way too much attention gets paid in my view to the price of these assets and it's sort of inescapable but the more the more I can separate myself from what's happening with the price at any given quarter or a year um I think the better decision making we make as a company to just keep building uh for the long term so that's what we're trying to do do in this in this down Market we've been through a couple of these Cycles uh you probably won more than than I have but you know what we what we know and I think a lot of people in this room probably appreciate is the bear Market can last longer and it will take a little bit slower ramp to get out of than most people think at the time especially because of recency bias and just kind of coming off the highs and still being really convicted in the long term for coinbase you're a public company now so we know what your numbers are right at least a private company you could there was a little bit of ambiguity in terms of how the company was doing and um and now you're under a microscope in terms of like what the different line ",
        "10": "items of the business look like going forward Vault prices down volatility down volumes down Core Business coinbase also down it's easy to project it's a simple model assumption but coinbase and we had surged on you know uh on Wednesday for for conversation around product we talked a little bit about some of the other non-exchange products that you have cooking where do you think you really need to get things right in the next couple of years as you de-risk coinbase as a platform and go from just having the exchange as the 80 90 driver of value and fees and revenue to something that's a little bit more multifaceted and has all these other service offerings and truly Bridges web 3 Beyond just Exchange absolutely yeah so I think if you look at the last 10 years the first 10 years of crypto if you will you know exchanges were the best business model and I think if you look at the next 10 years uh we are going to see the the best businesses ",
        "11": "kind of diversify more and for companies that were this sort of first decade of exchange companies I you know coinbase is a great example of this we've started diversifying our Revenue stream going back a handful of years and planting the seeds of these things which will eventually start growing so um we call this subscription and services Revenue in our public statements um but as opposed to trading fee Revenue but that's the subscription Services Revenue has now grown from about four percent two years ago to about 18 of our Revenue which is really good and some of those those seeds we planted are turning into saplings you know and hopefully they'll keep growing over time so it's things like coinbase Cloud right we're building kind of the picks and shovels for hopefully all kinds of companies and startups to be integrating crypto and it's things like um you know coinbase card and coinbase earn and our staking business has turned out to be a really good one as well even things like USD coin right which has been um a nice counter-cyclical uh piece of revenue for us as we're seeing interest rates get hiked in this uh down market so you know ",
        "12": "it's it's interesting as a public company you basically get higher multiples for predictable revenue and trading fee trading for revenue is just not predictable right and so um I think it's going to be a very important part of our strategy to keep diversifying revenue streams over time and start to think about coinbase the parent company as almost like a portfolio of different um products or companies that that are each building with different revenue streams and cultures how do you manage the build process now that every single time you want to launch something new it seems like you have to go get permission from some Regulators that in the last couple of years have seemed to have grown increasingly hostile right so you kind of alluded to your Tweet um uh from uh from about a you know six months ago 12 months ago regarding the uh the coinbase well not earn but it was the uh the the interest bearing product that you had which was tough to get from zero to one and you're kind of behind the eight ball versus all the overseas or or lightly regulated or less ",
        "13": "regulated companies they were able to ship these without necessarily the the oversight and the permission elements um is that something that's going to persist across product lines or there's some areas where you're able to move a little bit faster that you're leaning into on the services side yeah so so coinbase really again the parent company is really almost like a portfolio of different products and almost like their own companies at this point with their own P L's so for instance our retail product that most people know us for you know probably has the highest regulation um and there's a lot of consumer protection and kyc AML and a lot of the products you know we engage with Regulators all over the world on various products we're launching and you know it does slow down the process sometimes but I don't think that that's abnormal like there's there's lots of value to be generated in regulated markets and we think you know at this point regardless of what we we think about regulation it's going to be a regulated market and so we just need to get become excellent at that some of our policy efforts have helped with that we also have our Prime business which focuses on institutions and that's also ",
        "14": "regulated but there's less of a consumer protection um you know lens around that because Regulators think of those are big boys you know they can they can handle themselves if they if they lose funds or something like that it's their their hedge funds and you know family offices and things like that and we also have a part of our business you know we call it kind of like web3 or ecosystem but it's things like our self-custodial wallet coinbase wallet right or um coinbase Commerce or coinbase nft and cloud is in there and things like that and actually that's probably the least regulated piece of our business I think in the self-custodial world we're going to see a lot more Innovation just because um in the so you know self-custodial wallet that we as a company we're never taking custody of customer funds and so it's regulated more like a software company instead of a financial service company so just by the nature of there being less regulation there I think we'll actually see um more Innovation and frankly even better consumer protection because like there's lower switching costs between um the different products you know if people don't like the coinbase one they can it's all interoperable built on ",
        "15": "these Open Standards so you can move your stuff over to another one and um ironically like you know regulations often there to create more consumer protection but it also creates more um hurdles for startups to get created so there's higher switching costs and you get sort of regulatory capture by the incumbents in a weird way the more regulation there is in the world around crypto probably the better our our regulated retail and institutional businesses will do um so I kind of like that we're doing the self-custodial the web 3 stuff the decentralized piece as well because it's going to drive Innovation and create consumer protection in a totally different way by just lowering switching costs I'd imagine you're spending more time in DC than you probably thought you were going to be at the beginning of the year um but you have been there and spending time there for many cycles in in different contexts right like explaining what is bitcoin probably in the early days what is crypto more generally and what's the potential and now how does it actually interface with the regulated Financial system and how do we minimize systemic risks and solve some of these bigger challenges that have emerged as the industry's grown ",
        "16": "What's um what's the vibe right now right like you know what what's what's going on in like the smoke-filled rooms the proverbial like smoke-filled rooms um and and what do you see coinbase's role in that conversation being um historically when we've gotten to this point in you know the internet days or kind of with big data monopolies they um they'll they'll engage they'll talk the talk they'll they'll sit in these rooms and then ultimately they're subject to regulatory capture and that becomes a moat for them um coinbase is interesting because you have made all of these web3 Investments you mentioned the wallet you mentioned cloud and you've been very public about some things like how you would treat a staking as a service as uh core service if certain transactions were going to be censored or you were going to basically be you know subject to censorship yourself as a as a custodian of these assets so how do you get that balance right you know you've got shareholders now you've been through multiple Cycles with ",
        "17": "with some of these folks in DC you've got a lot of advisors giving you different information I'm sure what's the balance and what do you think your responsibility is to your end users and and kind of the industry at large since it is still early stage yeah so you're right I mean coinbase is a global company and we've tried to engage with Regulators all over the world from from day one you know first to be just an educational resource and just show up and be legitimate and then after that it's been to sort of try to help shape some of the policy behind the scenes and in rare cases you know we do have to we feel like we have to push back if we see something that's egregious or it didn't kind of go through a good process to gather input from the community and whatnot but specifically on DC yeah so for a long a while now I've been going to DC I'd say on average about twice a year um you know it's one of those things where as a CEO you always have constraints on your time right and you know I like focusing on building great products with technology like that's my favorite thing but obviously we need to invest some amount of time in DC and so um I've been I've been going there and I think just showing up starting to get to know the people you know um having repeated uh conversations with them is ",
        "18": "helpful so they you just want to basically put a face to the name so they look at you and they're like okay this is like a reasonable person trying to do something good in the world they're not crazy you know and and sometimes if it's just purely through the internet and they're just reading your stuff online it's so easy to be dismissive of somebody but if you meet them in person most people can't help but kind of like you more so um most of the people we've interacted with in DC are actually like super reasonable you know I think um most despite what you may think I don't know that like the folks in we've met with in Congress I think there's really good progress happening um on a couple of different bills I'm actually kind of optimistic that by end of next year we'll see some comprehensive regulation passed in the US that sort of clarifies the role of the cftc versus this versus the SEC or you know versus treasury kind of makes good definitions of what's a commodity what's a security what is a stablecoin what is you know artwork like nfts and and that kind of stuff and so there's you know one of those bills is sponsored by um stab now and Bookman which are two uh policy makers there and and it's ",
        "19": "bipartisan support by the way that's one of the things I was really excited to see in DC is that there's actually strong bipartisan support for crypto legislation so the midterms will be an interesting moment where I think you'll see a shift of power but it won't probably pause or harm any of the progress on uh crypto legislation that's now being contemplated in DC I do feel like um yeah it's been frustrating at times where you know I think the cftc has been like a pretty um good regulator for us to interact with I mean they're they all want to we all want to you know create sensible regulation things like that but they seem like fairly easy to work with I even think the SEC staff has been like quite cooperative and easy to work with in many instances I do think um there's been a lot of rhetoric from the SEC chair which has been had this kind of chilling effect on the US and I I do think it's caused a lot of startups and asset issuers and all kinds of people to sort of uh get nervous and maybe get crazy legal advice and we're starting to see some of that move overseas which is probably really bad for America I think it's been kind of unhelpful and ",
        "20": "you know the US is actually a little behind where um the rest of the world is like the EU has just passed this Mika regulation and we're seeing the UK and and Hong Kong and Singapore and Australia are all kind of on the cusp of passing this really clear regulation ahead of the U.S so I think the US is a little bit behind um but the good news is the majority of legitimate you know kind of reasonable people in DC whether it's the white house with their executive order Congress bipartisan support um the cftc even the SEC staff um Folks at treasury they all seem pretty reasonable and they're moving towards clear regulation so I think that's a that's a good positive trend how do you how do you balance between doing things like funding uh the defense of the uh tornado cash developers and and you know coming to the fence or or um speaking out against the sec's interpretation of Securities or what they consider Securities on your platform through the side door mechanism of of a case where there was an insider trading element which you reported and ",
        "21": "and is being prosecuted by the appropriate authorities um you know you have to kind of pick your battles and we're trying to educate policy makers regulators and win converts down in DC while also holding a firm line and that seems like it's very much at odds or can be at odds or you know potentially explosive and damaging if it's handled the wrong way so what are the what are the precedents on like yeah where I guess that another way where are you guys willing to go to the map and you know where are you like really looking to engage and compromise to come up with you know the best available policy for us and are there guiding principles um for those two buckets or do you just try to take this kind of case by case as it comes yeah so look I mean honestly it's a little frustrating sometimes because you know I think the most valuable thing that we can be doing with our time and resources at coinbase is building great products with technology and you know I ",
        "22": "want to be making sure we're integrating all the l2s out there getting scalability the blockchains better and better and you know we should be making it just super simple for anybody to kind of not just own crypto but then access any web3 app out there and and just make that whole thing seamless so it's not like the average person I don't think we're gonna get to a billion people if it's like you know you have to learn how to bridge to an L2 and then move it to your Chrome extension and like you know the security needs to get better oh that's the stuff where we can add the most value so in some ways it's frustrating because I feel like every few weeks there's some kind of piece of information that's running rampants around the world whether it's through media or in government there's some kind of proposal and it's like really like that's the idea that they're proposing um and so you know we kind of have to jump in and often we have an awesome policy team and like people not just us like actually the whole crypto industry has like really dialed up the policy efforts which has been awesome so I think we have more and more coverage around these things but to answer your question specifically if we see some kind of Regulation or policy come out that we think it's ",
        "23": "basically treating crypto on an unlevel playing field with traditional Financial Services or it's just like punitive right um we're probably going to push back on that right if if we see something that um we think exceeds the authority of the the institution that's doing it like which is what happened in my view with this recent um treasury case with uh tornado cash you know we we support their their progress and their effort around sanctioning Bad actors I think that's a good thing you know we should be able to basically Blacklist like addresses of you know known terrorists and things like that but that's not what happened in this case they sanctioned an entire technology not not a person or property which is what their Authority is articulated as at least that's my understanding by Congress that that Authority is given to them so if we see things like that that's the areas where um we're gonna push back and I think just in general I would say I think the exchanges and any company that's kind of storing customer funds is probably going to be regulated kind of like a financial service but what I ",
        "24": "really want to preserve in the world um you know for freedom and Innovation and all this is is the decentralized piece so that's like self-custodial wallets I think you should be able to kind of access whatever you want there you know you shouldn't need to like upload a bunch of documents like proving your identity or whatever um I don't think those fun you should be able to seize those funds from people like I I basically like I'm you know I'm pro-freedom in the world and I think it creates better Innovation and better outcomes for individuals and so um I'm going to be a champion for freedom and um and for the whole crypto industry I think that's what's going to create the most positive outcome in society long term and that's what the mission of our company is about is economic freedom how to increase that in the world and so uh that's where you'll see us go to the map do you think we'll have more successes in Industry if we all just Rebrand as effective altruists you don't have to answer that I don't want to get you in trouble I don't know I'm just trying to stir the pot a little bit no uh look I know no issue with whatever ",
        "25": "other people are doing I I'm I've been trying to learn about philanthropy too to be honest like I I went to this um you know giving pledge conference and like um I don't know I'm still figuring it out I I honestly like the best way to add value to the world so far that I've seen is through creating great companies um and even for-profit companies I think add a ton of value to the world um you know what we've tried some philanthropic efforts like we did something called give crypto and you know I would say it was like a good V1 and like some stuff didn't go as well as we hoped but like I'm damn glad we tried and we'll probably keep trying stuff like that so um yeah I'm trying to figure out philanthropy too let me know if you if you get it figured out yeah well I'll I'll let you know once I figured it all out in the meeting of life and and whatnot so um all right last question let's let's zoom out a little bit and uh and give people something to shoot for you know the the next 12 months um what's a good outcome look like and what's going to take to get there on the policy fronts and and kind of how what's the most effective thing that people can do to build through the bear market and ",
        "26": "make sure we have a a good country to actually build Services products open protocols and uh and and really you know I think Financial products that espouse you know American values yeah um and yeah I mean they're they're kind of like Western value even outside of America it's just like approach freedom and things like that um I keep trying to think more globally not just us even though we are based in the US I think it's been the best place for us to kind of have an impact um but in terms of your question what's a good outcome I mean I think the two biggest things we can do to unlock the next wave of growth in crypto is regulatory Clarity and scalability of the of the blockchains um so on the regulatory Clarity front you know I think we can uh try to make sure that these bills pass in places like um in the US with this stab now Bozeman Bill hopefully the language gets really nailed down it preserves Innovation with in defy um you know we get similar stuff ",

        "28": "with slower internet previously I think that's the kind of stuff that's it's on the order of that level of importance to get the change even more scaled up the last thing I'll say is just in the down Market you know don't die right like all every crypto startups out there has got to be managing their costs carefully um and you know look nobody can really predict how long this this sort of recession is going to last but it seems like we're going to have more interest rate hikes um there's going to be more pain for a little while but you know this is always dangerous to predict but like my base case at the moment is you know by end of 2023 2023 hopefully we're kind of seeing signs of life and maybe coming out of this thing um but it could last longer than that right it could be shorter it could be longer but that's kind of my base case is uh Q4 2023 or second half or something like that um so we'll see I'm guessing but uh make sure no the companies don't die in the meantime you're pretty buttoned up on Twitter do you have an alt d-gen Spartan no I mean I don't really ",
