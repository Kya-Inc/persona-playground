        "1": "ladies and gentlemen good morning and welcome to officially welcome you all to the event joining us on stage from the coinbase india team put your hands together for pankaj gupta namaste and hello friends i am so thrilled to welcome you all to today's coinbase crypto event our very first one in india this event is being streamed to thousands of online viewers thank you all for joining us first a bit about myself ",
        "2": "my name is pankaj gupta and i'm vp of engineering at coinbase and the site lead for coinbase in india i was born in dilli i grew up in a small place called berserai in south delhi today i live with my family right here in nama bengaluru i wanted to share a little bit about how i got into crypto and web3 for many years i worked on this wonderful app on your left that is built on top of upi and hopefully many of you use daily while working on upi i saw the power of open and interoperable networks they can really spur innovation they can really impact the lives of common people and at this time i chance to chance upon bitcoin and ethereum white papers with my computer science background and a little bit of fintech knowledge working on payments product ",
        "3": "i could really understand the power and the huge leap of innovation than the these new technologies are even beyond traditional financial systems and technology i kept reading and tinkering and i was hooked so when coinbase was looking to start a tech hub in india last year i jumped on the opportunity now the story of the last decade in india is the story of a country having gone through staggering digital revolution whether it is the aadhaar identity platform that provides identity to more than a billion indians today or the hockey stick growth of upi which all of us experience daily or the standardization provided by gstn i think it's safe to say that india today is digitally one of the most advanced countries in the world today ",
        "4": "more than a hundred years ago mahatma gandhi said i do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed i want the culture of all lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible thankfully we live in a free india today and as mahatma gandhi said we need to continue to be welcoming to new ideas the new and modern ideas of crypto and web3 are these new ideas that i believe can help us can really further our goals of economic freedom as well as bring wealth and jobs to india to further our economy to help build a self-reliant india an arthur and i'm convinced ",
        "5": "i'm beyond convinced that the next digital revolution the next big thing is crypto and web 3 and not just me right all of you who are here everyone who's watching online as well as tens of millions of indians who are engaged in this vibrant ecosystem in some shape or form are convinced that crypto and web 3 are the next big things and that's why we are here today friends we have an action-packed agenda today we will kick it off with a keynote by brian armstrong co-founder and ceo of coinbase this will be followed by product keynote by suroji chatterjee our chief product officer then i will have the pleasure of hosting brian for a fireside chat hopefully it will be very interesting this will be followed by a special guest talk by balaji srinivasan on open problems in web3 following which we will ",
        "6": "have an entertaining fireside chat by none other than than bharat with both execs and coinbase as well as industry leaders today's speakers include executives from coinbase i already talked about brian and surojit we also have manish gupta who's executive vp of engineering at coinbase and sean agrawal who's the vp of co-op development and the head of coinbase ventures in addition to executives from coinbase we have special guests today tanmay and baloji again i talked about i'm thankful to richard yoshi from epns and jyan lakshmi from quest book also join us today ladies and gentlemen i have the utmost pleasure to welcome mr brian armstrong co-founder and ceo of coinbase to the ",
        "7": "stage please give it up for brian i'm very excited to be here today we're here to celebrate coinbase's long-term investment in india and the efforts that we're making to bring the power of this technology to this region of the world my name is brian armstrong i'm the co-founder and ceo of coinbase and i want to start by telling you a little bit about the origin of coinbase back in 2010 i read the bitcoin white paper for the very first time and it talked about this new technology that had the potential to revolutionize how we move value all over the world fast forward to today and what started was with just an application i started coding on my laptop has now become a global company we have ",
        "8": "89 million verified users all over the world just in q4 of last year we traded over 500 billion dollars of crypto customers trust us to store crypto for them we are storing 278 billion dollars of crypto and of course we have 4 000 employees now all over the world including many here in india which i'll talk about in a minute last year we were fortunate enough to become a public company listed on the nasdaq in the u.s so why did we start this company why did why are we all working so hard to advance this technology in the world what comes back to the mission for coinbase it comes back to that initial insight that i had when i read the bitcoin white paper more than 10 years ago now so our mission as a company is to increase economic freedom in the world we believe cryptocurrency offers a unique moment in history along with the proliferation of the smartphone and internet access to everywhere in the world to bring about economic freedom economic freedom is a term that economists use kind of like gdp or ",
        "9": "something like that and it looks at a number of different factors in society things like are property rights enforced is there free trade can people start the companies they want to start and can they work at the businesses they want to work at is the currency stable and how prevalent are things like corruption and bribery and what's so exciting about economic freedom why it's such an important measure of the different countries of the world is that it correlates positively with many things that we all want in society not just economic growth but also things like higher life expectancy and income of the poorest 10 percent better even self-reported happiness and better treatment of the environment and economic freedom is negatively correlated with things that we want to avoid infant mortality corruption unemployment even even war so it's this really incredible and powerful idea which is that if we can inject good financial infrastructure good property rights into countries all over the world societies can benefit in really profound ways ",
        "10": "so why is crypto such a unique moment in history to create this economic freedom well this technology is inherently suited for economic freedom if you want property rights well now anybody with a smartphone anywhere in the world can store their own wealth crypto also offers things like stable coins it offers ways for people to store their value in a way that it can't be eroded from them crypto is inherently global and cross-border so it enables free trade and of course crypto doesn't care about who you are what you look like where you're from where you were born it anybody in the world can access it on a level playing field which is a truly profound thing there aren't these middlemen and gatekeepers now india is especially an important market for us because it's the second largest company country in the world and a very large number of people here are still i think something like 180 190 million are still under banked or underbanked and of course india has shown a great ",
        "11": "willingness to adopt financial infrastructure with upi adar india stack to help better their own lives and the lives of everybody in their communities so how do we think crypto is going to evolve over time and what is coinbase doing to help that happen well a lot of people think about cryptocurrency primarily today as a speculative asset something that people trade and they hope it might go up and down or value in value and that that's true that is like that is the early way that a lot of people are getting access to cryptocurrency today they want to buy some of it that's how it started in other countries as well as an asset class but the potential of it is much much more than that and in countries like the united states we're already seeing more than 50 percent of our active user base do something other than just trading of crypto so what else are they doing well crypto is moving beyond an investment and it's also becoming a new financial system so people are using it to make commerce payments they're using it to earn a living they're using it to borrow and lend get access to credit ",
        "12": "and even earn yield on their assets in novel ways this is things like defy for instance and crypto is now going beyond even just new financial services it's actually creating a new type of application platform where people are building all kinds of new applications things like identity systems voting and governance with dows types of artwork with nfts and games and you know every basically every type of new application today by the best entrepreneurs in the world they're looking at crypto to see how can we build on top of it as a new platform just like the birth of the internet in the early 2000s so coinbase's role in all of this is that we try to build products that are trusted and easy to use cryptocurrency is still very new it's very technical it's it's kind of scary and so we try to make it trusted in a number of ways one of the ways we do that is we work proactively with regulators all over the world to try to make it trusted and regulated we in policy makers we also work a lot on ",
        "13": "cyber security to ensure and consumer protection to ensure customers are protected on our products and services and then we also try to make crypto easier to use you don't need to understand what a private key is or a protocol or a blockchain you can turn on a light switch and use electricity even if you don't understand how electricity works you can benefit from these technologies and that's what we're doing with our products we're trying to make them accessible to a billion people in the world and more so let me talk for a minute about why i'm so excited about india in particular so india of course is a country with incredible engineering talent it's incredible entrepreneurial talent and they've shown a really great willingness to embrace new technologies as a way to improve the world and and their lives and coinbase's role here it's going to be a very long-term game we're making a long-term investment we know it's not going to be a straight shot to bring this technology we don't know exactly how it's going to evolve but we're committed to working with bank partners ",
        "14": "regulators most importantly the indian people because they've shown a real spark of interest in cryptocurrency and there's a real desire to get access to some of these services and products so i'm excited to announce that uh coinbase now has 300 employees in india and we'll have a thousand employees here by the end of the year we've already made 150 million dollars in investments in indian crypto startups not coinbase as a company but indian crypto startups and we'll be making many more investments like that over time i want to wrap by saying before i turn it over to uh surajid our chief product officer i just want to wrap by saying a big thank you to the india team here at coinbase including pankaj gupta sanchez and everybody on the team here they're the ones who deserve the credit for making this happen and getting it to where it is today so let's give them a big round of applause ",
        "15": "and with that i want to turn it over to serge chatterjee our chief product officer thank you hello everyone i'm surajit chatterjee i'm chief product officer at coinbase and i'm excited and a little bit humbled to be here today and having this opportunity to share with you an important announcement for coinbase in india now growing up in a small town near kolkata i had my brush with financial lack of financial inclusion pretty early on and that's why this announcement is so personal to me let me tell you a story and it may resonate with many of you who grew up around the same time in india as i was ",
        "16": "anyone recognizes these anyone ever used this okay there are few hands over there you probably still have nightmares about these tokens so these were the brass tokens you needed to withdraw money from your account your bank account you know back then i would tag along with my mom when she went to the local bank to withdraw cash and the process used to be epic let me tell you the process so you filled out a form that's the first step and then you stood in a line just like this and then you got one of those tokens so you take the token and you wait sometimes the wait is many hours and you wait for your number to be called on the screen or sometimes they'll just announce the number when they announce the number by the way you have a sense of accomplishment already that your number has come but it's not done yet you have to stand in another line like this ",
        "17": "and maybe another hour or so will pass and then you are at the front of the line and then they will try to match your signature and often the signature would not match so you repeat the whole process again and sometimes you know your child may lose the token which happened in my case at least couple of times and i can't forget the scolding i got from my mom because you have to go and pay a fine if you lose that token and you have to start the process all over again now think about it for a moment why was it so difficult why is it was it so hard to take money from your own account now at that time in india there are only a few nationalized banks in fact in my town there was only one bank and the name of the bank had the word state in it you can probably guess which bank it was and less choice really meant less freedom ",
        "18": "by the way having said all that i think my family was still the luckier ones we at least had a bank account at that time hundreds of millions of indian families were completely excluded from the financial system fast forward to today things are a lot different you know india has made tremendous progress in a relatively short time in financial inclusion and technological innovation and we think there are two key drivers for that number one is this rapid proliferation of mobile internet everybody has a mobile phone now almost everybody at least and number two the upi just made it very simple for anyone with a mobile phone access digital payments we think crypto is going to drive the next step in financial inclusion in india we think crypto and of3 has the potential ",
        "19": "to create the next step change benefit for the indian society just like the upi or mobile internet did back in the days you know vcs actually already knows this investors knows this india is going through a fintech revolution and investment in fintech has grown from 600 million in back in 2016 to almost 7 billion last year it's a tremendous amount of money coming in to power financial inclusion innovation in financial inclusion in india and we see there's no stopping today india boasts many unicorn companies in fintech and what's interesting is many of those companies are actually crypto with three companies and another interesting fact is that coinbase has been involved in this innovation in this process of innovation pretty early on in fact we have invested over 150 million dollars in over 10 companies in india ",
        "20": "and some of the names on the screen here are coin in coinbase ventures portfolio names like polygon by economy point dcx coin switch and many more to come and that's what makes it interesting today i think crypto can power the next revolution in financial inclusion in india and i think coinbase can play an important role so i'm going to talk about what we are announcing today what we are launching today the idea here is giving every indian every indian user with a mobile phone and internet connection the power to tap into the global economy the global crypto economy the power to access global financial products and giving them exponentially more choices than my family and hundreds of millions of families ever had when i was growing up as a kid let me show you how you're going to do it so very simply you go to google play store or apple app store and download ",
        "21": "our app and you click on get started once you click on get started we'll ask you to fill out some simple information about yourself and set a strong password by the way you'll see this theme throughout brian also talked about it trust and security are the foundational pillar for everything we build at coinbase so you'll see that as we set up your account so next you'll have to verify your through an email verification that you start initiated that account setup and then you'll set up your two-factor authentication this process may be familiar to a lot of you in india today because it's very similar to what you do in many other apps so we're going to send you a few quick messages and you confirm and that's it you set up your two-factor authentication next we are going to ask you to verify your identity and this is really important to comply with know your customer laws ",
        "22": "and any money anti-money laundering laws in the country so we'll ask you to verify your identity fill out a couple of simple forms again and upload your government issued id which is other in case of india once you do that and confirm you are verified and that's it now you are ready and you are at the on the home screen of coinbase app this is really the launch pad for your journey into the crypto economy now you can buy sell send receive stake and do many more things with crypto and i'm going to demonstrate today how you can buy some crypto in few simple steps so first step in buying crypto is setting up your payment method it will set up upi so you can buy crypto instantly from your bank account with just a few taps so you go to set up your payment method you choose upi and we are going to ask you your api information you can form that ",
        "23": "you add your api id and now you have connected your upi id with your coinbase account and you have saved that information so next time you don't have to do that again you can just instantly buy and then you are back to the main home page of coinbase and you'll see an invitation to get started you click on that and you can click on tap on buy and you will see a choice of many assets that you can buy today we're going to buy some ethereum and you can buy as little as 100 rupees of ethereum so you just put 100 rupees you pay with upi you can form the fees and etcetera the the order review page uh and then you go and tap on that and then in on this step it will go to your upi app and just quickly confirm just like buying anything with upi and that's it you have bought your first crypto so as you saw buying onboarding to coinbase and buying your first crypto is super simple very ",
        "24": "easy and and very very fast all right so you come to their port home page and you see you have bought crypto so we have been actually experimenting with this for last few weeks and i'm thrilled to see the excitement the indian users already have about this product we have got a lot of good comments on twitter but we are not done yet we are going to keep iterating and making the product better it's just the beginning so what's next what's next is web3 you know if you remember the early web was the read-only web aol and yahoo are examples today's web is read and write web read write interactively so you know large companies like facebook and google actually own and control a lot of the infrastructure of today's web and it's monetized by advertising india actually has leapfrogged web one and directly went ",
        "25": "into web two the next version of web will be web 3 and it will be a decentralized web which means it will be driven by blocked and decentralized blockchain infrastructure where users actually own a stake in the infrastructure and users are rewarded for participating and operating that infrastructure and they are rewarded with crypto tokens we think every service on the internet that exists today community gaming media and of course financial services is going to be disrupted and reimagined for web 3 and we think that means billions of users and trillions of market cap waiting to be unlocked in wave 3. i have a dream that someone in a small town just like the town i grew up in is already working on a project that will become a trillion dollar market cap company in web 3 in india ",
        "26": "and and of course the world this is india's opportunity to lead globally and we think we can help that's why we are here i already talked about coinbase ventures we have invested in a number of op3 companies and will continue to do so and we are also building powerful tools and services like coinbase cloud coinbase wallet to help developers build a better version of the web a more secure a faster and more decentralized version of the internet i can't wait to see what we can accomplish together or in my native tongue my mother tongue challah [Applause] i'm not done yet one more thing ",
        "27": "please scan this qr code or use the promo code to start your journey into crypto and web 3 you can quickly download the app and punch the promo code in or or just scan it and you're going to get free money 201 rupees in bitcoin once you make your first trade on our app and of course if you want to work in the cutting-edge web 3 technology we are hiring we are hiring here in india we are hiring all over across the world and the interesting thing is we are a remote first company so you can be anywhere in any corner of india as long as you have a good internet connection you can work on web3 and you can work at coinbase so please check out coinbase.com carriers and see if there are any positions that interest you and please reach out and join us so thank you so much for spending this time with me and welcome and and for the warm welcome back to india i can't wait to see what we can build ",
        "28": "together in of3 thank you [Applause] and now for a conversation about coinbase and india and how crypto and web3 technology can help accelerate india's economic and financial inclusion goals please welcome back onto the stage brian armstrong and pankaj grouper [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey brian how are you doing that was great that namaste is is a picture which will be flashed in everywhere so thank ",
        "29": "you for doing that um welcome again to india thank you um we are really thrilled to have you here and okay so i have so many questions to ask you friends this is a deck of 52 cards no let me just dive right in we'll start with early coinbase years your personal journey so my first question is would be great if you can tell us a little bit about coinbase's origin and how you got into crypto yeah sure so i studied computer science and economics in school and i was a coder i was doing some engineering jobs i had a couple of formative experiences before coinbase one of them was that i had moved to argentina for a year and i lived there and i got a chance to see what that economy and country had gone through with hyperinflation and that as you know having only grown up in the united states that was a formative experience to see something a little bit different and i think the second thing was that i worked at airbnb so i got a job early at airbnb they were moving money to 190 countries all over the world and i was ",
        "30": "an engineer there working on some of their payment systems and fraud systems and i got a front row seat into what the global patchwork of different payment systems looks like all over the world and it really is like every country almost having their own proprietary system usually it's a it's a local oligopoly of players and there hadn't been a lot of innovation and transparency and efficiency there yeah so when i first saw the bitcoin white paper in 2010 which i mentioned something went off in my head and i said this seems pretty cool i i didn't i didn't really fully understand it i didn't know if it would work um i thought about all the different ways it could fail i went to go talk to some of my smartest friends and they all told me i don't get it it sounds like a scam i don't think this will work and so i had a lot of self-doubt about it i was going to these early bitcoin meetups in san francisco california and there was this mix of you know computer science phds and anarchists and just crazy people and so it was a very unique group of people that were interested in it early on but what happened was on nights and ",
        "31": "weekends i started coding up this prototype and i thought you know maybe if this protocol is out there now kind of like you know email has a protocol and the internet has a protocol with http and tcp maybe somebody is going to need a simple way to access and use this protocol kind of like you use gmail instead of running your own email server or something like that so i created that prototype i applied to y combinator which is a startup incubator in san francisco and they were the first people who wrote me this check for 150k and they were the first people to really say maybe you're not crazy you know maybe this is worth trying something and that's what gave me the confidence to quit my job and start working on coinbase and from there it was it was a wild wild ride well thank you for thank you for doing that uh that certainly is the reason why i am here in coinbase today so thank you for that um what were the early days of coinbase the startup like yeah well once the company had actually been founded and ",
        "32": "um i had gotten you know i was lucky enough to find fred ursum who was a end up being the co-founder of coinbase and we were basically working 12-hour days you know during the day we would try to write code work on the website talk to customers you know nobody was using the product we put out the product in the first version of it really nobody stuck around and used it and so we were just coding talking to customers during the day and at night we would think about why it wasn't working and so one day we just called up these customers and and we said well you signed up for the app you know you didn't you never came back what was wrong and they said well i like the app but i don't really have any bitcoin you you talk you talk to actual customers like and ask them hey what's going on yeah i mean it was just us two in an apartment so there was no and we were just calling up people and they said one of them said you know well i would have used the app but i don't have any bitcoin and i said if we had put a buy button a buy button in the in the app would you have bought bitcoin and then had bitcoin and he and he said yes maybe and so we went about trying to get that simple buy sell ",
        "33": "experience working and i'll gloss over all the details there was lawyers and banks partners and lots of skepticism and legal opinion letters but we eventually got it we launched it and from there we saw a spark of interest and it started to grow organically and so really it felt like for you know a year or two there we were just toiling away not having no idea if it would ever work and suddenly we got the right thing fixed where it started to work i i would say those days were fun they were but at the moment they didn't feel fun there was like a lot of sleep deprivation and there was hackers trying to break into our site and lots of you know we were desperately trying to hire as many good people and raise money so i feel very lucky there was probably a couple moments there early on where if the coin had flipped the other way we wouldn't have been here today do you do you recall an especially scary moment in this journey i'm sure there were many um but do you does does something still give you kind of like shivers yeah well i remember ",
        "34": "early on there was one bank partner that we had and we went you know they were always a little bit nervous about crypto and they started to see the numbers were getting you know bigger and bigger every day i remember one day they called us in and the compliance officer there and they were just like we don't know what this is we don't know what you're doing this was back in you know 2013 2014 and they said we're going to close your bank account in um in 90 days or something like that and we we were that could have been the end of the business and so we went around and we met with all these different banks in the u.s we finally got other bank partners online you know we invested so much in our compliance program over the years and i mean now today it just feels like we're that was like you know five ten years ago now today we work with the biggest banks in the u.s and around the world and so it just completely shifted but we still encounter people every day where we go meet them for the first time and they're skeptical they don't understand it and so i suspect that will be true 10 years from now too there's only only 200 million or so people in the world have actually tried ",
        "35": "crypto at this point and well i think about how do we get it to be two billion people or the majority of the world if you look at how the internet adoption grew over the years we're still in the very very early innings of this this change thank you thank you for sharing that um and it's been quite a journey um for yourself it's uh amazing that when i think about you started the company in 2012 and um what did you learn about yourself while building coinbase uh all through these years yeah well i guess one thing i learned about myself was that you know i was always kind of an introvert i was kind of shy i didn't think of myself as being very um good at communicating with people i was good at writing code you know and so i was kind of like the typical awkward engineer a little bit especially especially as i was younger and i never thought that i could be a ceo actually i thought ceos were these people that were these like you know i envisioned them like military generals like giving orders to people and super charismatic and i was like that's not really me ",
        "36": "um but what i learned over time is that you can be any kind of ceo you want and actually there's a lot of very good ceos who are technical nerd founders you know if you will running some of the largest companies in the world today and so that it sounds maybe silly i i don't know at that time i didn't think i could be a ceo but i learned i can i can do it and i can play to my strengths and then surround myself with people on the team who are much better at the things that i'm not as good at that's wonderful thank you i learned a little bit how to be an extrovert so oh thank you thank you for sharing that yeah um let me move on from the early years to today yeah um [Music] about coinbase you know there's just so many fascinating things about coinbase but one of them that i find the most fascinating is that we are completely remote first yeah and um can you please share with the audience uh what that means how you decided on this and how's it going so far yeah well of course during covid it we all had to start working remotely at least in software and what we realized ",
        "37": "is that this was not just a setback it was a bit of an opportunity so what we did is we decided to lean into this trend and we said coinbase is going to be remote first that means no one's required to come into the office and work but if you want to you can but what that means is if you're going to come into the office you have to continue to work as if you're in a remote environment you know everybody should sign in separately to video conference for instance and make sure that it's not a disadvantage for anybody working at home now there's pros and there's cons to this but i believe the pros outweigh the cons the cons are that it can be harder for teams to feel a sense of belonging it can be harder to get sparks of creativity in the downtime you know the typical the proverbial water cooler talk um so that sense of bonding is a little bit lost and what we do to try to mitigate that is we try to get every team at coinbase together in person uh once a quarter or so we're not perfect because of covid but like that's our aspiration and so we mitigate it with these basically we go do off sites in person um and the benefits of remote work are ",

        "107": "see this is good for those who are very new who have a lot of time in their hands but if you see experienced web 2 devs who have 6 years of experience 10 years of experience they have families they have people to go back to home they can't keep building and shipping for 24 hours right and the company culture that they get into is like this it's build it ship it i know nobody's saying it or probably nobody wants to talk about the smile on manisha's face right now but this is the reality right i know bunch of experienced folks who are working with me on grant projects like small grant projects right fifty thousand sixty thousand dollars but they have the potential to go full on web3 because they are such amazing full stack devs but they just don't want to they feel like the pressure is too much so i think because we are still nascent and there is so much pressure to build and ship companies need to consciously come up with a culture that is you know that is conducive to like okay you can take a ",
        "108": "break you can you know you can build and ship but you don't have to do everything in like you know you don't have to work for 24 hours every day right because that's that's genuine there's a burnout culture right even if experienced devs come into a web 3 project and this has happened to quite a few of my friends who are literally forced to go into web3 but but they're amazing devs and they i want them to experience this ecosystem i want them to experience the innovation but they get burnt out right they burnt out three months six months and then they went back to their web 2 jobs they were like i'm going to contribute in the form of projects so i think there's a big culture mindset that has to come for this migration to actually happen right so when the culture starts becoming better and better down the line an year two years we are going to see a huge influx of these really good web to full stack devs wanting to explore the innovation in web3 and until then i feel like it's going to be more of a push from the community from the ecosystem that hey this is good why don't you do ",
        "109": "it kind of you know slow migration but yeah i feel like culture is one of the barriers uh that's going to set set back this migration that is like i'll say this is the beginning of an evolution actually like uh everybody who is currently in web 2 they'll have to think about how they up skill like up upskilled themselves to uh be more into web3 like my prediction is that every company that is pure web 2 today they will likely have to reinvent themselves or they will get disrupted and you see this from companies like google starting their own little blockchain unit you have facebook going all in on metaverse and things like that so um the expectation is that an engineers and all employees in all those companies will have to become more and more uh web free aware and with the enthusiast and that is skilled eventually yeah i asked an aj a friend of mine who moved to web3 i said what made you move he's like look three greater than two ",
