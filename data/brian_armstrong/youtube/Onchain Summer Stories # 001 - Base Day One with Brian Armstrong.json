        "1": "um you know why are you here what gets you fired up about base where do you think we're going in the next few years oh Brad we're not getting your audio we're not getting your audio we're doing this live you did you did unmute but it didn't work some reason check those settings how about now there we go now we got you it's sweet hey Fred who needs airpods anyway um okay so I think there's been a huge open question for crypto over the last five years which is are we ever going to go beyond just simple store value and digital money um and I think a huge limiter on that question has been do we have the infrastructure to build scalable applications um and I think the answer starting in ",
        "2": "2018 was sort of for really high value transactions as demonstrated in D5 but even just for regular payments and then I think for more consumer oriented applications where you need to be doing a lot of transactions and you needed to be doing them very cheaply I think in practice that's been really hard and that's been a huge limiter on crypto um which is I think why we're here today thankfully there's a whole bunch of people working on l2s and bases one of those along with optimism that I think is really exciting and just how many applications it can enable for crypto I love that and I'm curious um you know you've kind of watched the whole journey of coinbase from the beginning to where we are today what do you think it means that base is coming from coinbase and where do you think that that kind of puts us in our trajectory well first thank God for Jesse um I think my biggest fear and maybe ",
        "3": "Brian's too uh thank God for Brian making this happen it's been a massive team effort that's true too I think Brian deserves a lot of credit as a leader who is very open to new ideas and wants to see um as many people try as many great experiments within the company as possible I think it takes a special type of leader to allow that and not feel some need for uh too much top-down control um but going back to coinbase I think my biggest fear was always that coinbase would be kind of this old it basically would be the AOL of crypto um that it would be kind of old it would be the Fiat on-ramp but it would forever be the centralized company in this decentralized world um and one of the reasons I'm really excited about base is it's a true um experiment that is crypto native um coming from what could have been sort of the centralized dinosaur ",
        "4": "um and I'm excited about it as a result not not just for the space of crypto but also for for coinbase then hopefully this is the first of many things that coinbase does that is really crypto native I love that well thank you for sharing Fred I know you got to get to the airport so uh thank you for making the time to be here happy face day one excited to keep building with you in Paradigm and the incredible Builders who y'all are working with um thank you for being here congrats guys and here's the onshine summer baby let's go on chain summer awesome um now Brian we got 45 minutes 40 minutes uh you know the goal of this is just to talk about the summer talk about on chain talk about where we're going I want to start um maybe going back to the beginning of coinbase uh you know you started coinbase in 2012. it was the place to just buy Bitcoin um how how have you seen that kind of vision of coinbase change over the last ",
        "5": "decade yeah well we started off and the most important thing we had to do at that moment was just help people get a bunch of Fiat money into crypto that was this industry was never going to kick off unless we could provide that reliable bridge and I think that's an important function that we've served but even from the very earliest days of the company in 2012 you know myself and Fred we were sitting there thinking the reason we got into this is not because we wanted to just build a trading platform we wanted to see this create more economic freedom in the world create an entirely new updated Financial system that was more empowering to people had better property rights injected Good Financial infrastructure and people all over the world and and hopefully it added a bunch of non-financial service use cases too we did we couldn't perfectly see that at the time but it turned out you know identity and artwork and all these kind of things could be revolutionized by this as well so I think sometimes in the early days we were so focused on just keeping you know the on-ramps running because it went ",
        "6": "through periods of crazy hyper growth um and there's lots of challenges just with that piece but it I think people sometimes in the community maybe pigeonholed us into that like well that's that's what they do but at that even early on we were investing in things like self-custodial wallets right we were investing in things like Commerce how could that happen um in crypto we were investing in things like you know the debit card and um trying to find ways to add more chains and more and more assets and um so you know the really the big shift that I think we all have to do as an industry in a community now is help crypto grow from this early use case where people bought and sold some of it just kind of speculating on the value to creating daily utility and we've been doing that for a while this is this is not a new idea I mean we've got stable coins we've got nfts we've got D5 we have you know people have been trying all kinds of things with Dows there was like Ico craze so there's been a lot of work and experiments here um and the the big unlock I think one of the big unlocks next is getting Layer ",
        "7": "Two really deployed throughout the ecosystem where it just works you know the average person doesn't want to think about how to bridge to Layer Two um they're just trying to use some dap or pay some Merchant or send some money abroad or earn a living and so if we can as a community integrate these Layer Two Solutions and by the way we're supportive of all Layer Two Solutions in the industry um there's a lot of great ones out there lightning there's a bunch of good ones on on ethereum there's other blockchains which are even more scalable right already huge shout out to all those we're we're not trying to pick winners and losers we wanted to just help do our part to help it move forward and building on the optimism stack was a great way for us to kind of integrate with Community as well so anyway coinbase is very much we're going to keep making sure the on-ramps are solid there's a lot of regulatory headwinds we're going to go make sure good Clarity emerges there we're going to try to make sure there's good on-ramps all over the world but once people have money in crypto let's make it easier for them to actually go use stuff with it and so ",
        "8": "that's the next big push around driving utility I love that and I was I was just thinking back as you were saying we've been kind of building utility equipments for a while when I joined at the beginning of 2017 which I think was like five years in six years into the business one of the first things that I worked on was we had a hackathon and we had Toshi uh which was you know coinbase wallet the first version of coin swollen was just a messaging product um and I feel like that that was I mean that was in many ways your brainchild where you were fine messaging utility you were trying to push these chat apps um back in like 2016 2017 before that infrastructure was really ready it's so cool to see us now what seven years later where we have the layer twos we have the decentralized messaging protocols and now we have messaging in coinbase wallet um we have you know instant payments that are you know cost less than 10 cents in coinbase wallet it's wild to see that kind of transition from where we were and the vision to where we are now in the reality absolutely our day is divided where ",
        "9": "um we have we go meet with you know the biggest financial institutions in the world and they're like just dipping their toe in the water trying to get you know an ETF out or whatever and so for them this whole why would we do self-custody like we're trying you guys are the custodian we want you to and then the other half of our day we go spend the crypto Community that's on the Forefront of this and they're like why aren't you guys doing more Unchained we're like I know we want to do that too so you know I alternate between wearing you know the suit on the east coast and the black T-shirt um you know metaphorically on the west coast although it's really distributed everywhere even in New York and everywhere else too so it's really about what crowd we're meeting with yeah yeah I love that um so we talked about 2017 and kind of like the overall Vision I'm curious what's you know I have my story of Base which has been at this point I think like a two and a half year story starting in 2021 where we started to try and figure out I'm curious what like what's your story on face um what's from where you sat and where you've kind of watched us emerge over ",
        "10": "the last two and a half years how did like yeah what does it look like yeah well I mean I think if you really go back to I mean we started trying to do on-chain stuff way a long time ago we talked about what's Quimby's wallet and stuff but I think I don't know the origin of this in my mind is maybe around when we coinbase became a public company and we did a direct listing and at that time I came to the team and I said you know a direct listing is cool but that's kind of Trad fire like why can't we I mean if we're if we're getting they're gonna allow us to become a public company why can't we officially become a security token and with our own stock and allow people to trade it all over the world like we just did all this work to allow retail investors to be able to trade the company stock and we did a bunch of work on it we had tons of legal research and I was really I was really frustrated because basically the market structure was just not there you know the SEC was not cooperating they weren't allowing broker dealers and exchanges to operate in a regulated way and there was no ",
        "11": "legal way we could find at that time to do it now I think eventually that will come to fruition um with the market structure hopefully getting to a good place and coinbase is working hard on that and collaboration with the SEC to be honest um certain pockets of the SEC are actually much more open to this than others but um at that time so we had to put that on hold and I said okay well if we can't do that how do we make sure that um if you know the the the like the centralized pieces are kind of more mired in regulatory uncertainty right now right so more of the Innovation is going to happen in a decentralized world we'd already seen that start to happen with uniswap and D5 and do idx and like all these you know D5 summer was like a huge thing right right and so if more of the Innovation was going to be happening on chain in a decentralized way then I started to think more about okay great how can we help participate in that and frankly I didn't have the right idea I mean you were giving me a lot of credit earlier the only thing I did was I I when people like you in the gore came and I was like go for it like I want to ",
        "12": "do more of this stuff I don't know how to do it and you know Jesse's been such a great front man for this but it's really throughout the coinbase organization I think a lot of people don't realize that is that there are a thousand Jesse's inside the company who have been pushing to get coinbase to do more Unchained they want to drive utility of crypto that's why they got into crypto is they want a more open Financial system um it's not just about trading and speculation so it's a huge part of the culture at coinbase um and I think that was the origin of it for me was figuring out a way to get more of this utility going on chain and so anyway Jesse took the reins and ran with it and um this is what we got yeah well it's been quite the journey I feel like uh your description of kind of where this started is mirrors where my memory of where this started is and then I feel like we have like three or four other starts between that and what we got with based uh and it was uh I don't know like one of the things I feel incredibly grateful for and ",
        "13": "um you know I think is the reason why we're here today is throughout kind of a bunch of starts and stops to kind of trying to figure out like what does it actually mean for us to build more utility what does it mean for us to build in a more decentralized way um you just were there as a North star being like let's figure it out and even if these perfect you know these ideas that we're trying right now aren't exactly it like go back go find another one um and I think that that gave not just me and the team that's kind of been building base but you know there's thousands of people or the thousand people at coinbase uh the space to actually experiment and and try and fail and um I think create some some pretty cool stuff you know bass is one of them but there's a lot of other stuff coming too uh that's going to be on chain from coinbase absolutely and and so thinking a little bit about kind of uh the future from here I'm curious like what why do you think bass is important for the crypto economy why do you think later through is important what is this unlocked for ",
        "14": "us going forward yeah I think people are going to look back on this transition to Layer Two which has been in slow motion for happening for a while but I think things happen gradually and they happen suddenly and I think people are going to look back on it as a watershed moment um I'll give you an example which I think about a lot and my friend David Marcus kind of reminded me of this recently I hadn't thought about it in a while but you know text messages was was a big innovation at the time and it hit a peak of about 25 billion text messages per day globally and people thought you know that works pretty well it's great um but when WhatsApp came along it got to I think about 125 billion 5x messages per day um and of course WhatsApp is just one messaging app there's like a simple huge number going through Telegram and you know signal and all kinds of stuff and so it really showed that when you reduce the friction of something you don't just get a linear increase sometimes you get well like an ",
        "15": "order of magnitude right and it's not like text messages were even that high friction I mean they might have been like 10 or 20 cents or something like that you know they basically worked there was a character limit there was a few quirks like that how they worked in certain countries MMS wasn't really working super well so getting that level of friction out of the way you know probably 10x the amount of messages people wanted to send every day it turned out they wanted there was demand for a lot more just a little bit of friction held it back and so if you think about how does this apply to payments how does it apply to various things we're trying to do in crypto today there's an order of magnitude more demand than at least you know because I think actually the friction in L1 is probably much higher than what a text message was we're seeing you know five ten twenty dollars to get a transaction confirmed in 30 minutes or whatever on some of these l1s and so imagine if that's what text messages were so it kind of boggles your mind like what if payments were actually that low friction ",
        "16": "what might people do right I mean so think about lots of little things right I mean today most people get paid every two weeks for payroll and there's an entire industry built around this idea of payday lending which is basically just trying to get people their money a little sooner at some onerous rate right why aren't why isn't your role streaming to you just every hour or every minute or whatever right every second yeah why not um there's similarly for businesses by the way there's an entire you know industry of like Revenue recognition where you know you aren't paid on time and and it's like this massive issue right we've seen glimpses of what can happen when you have lower friction payments in uh places like in Asia where they're having these super apps like WeChat and of course they only work in one country and your privacy is kind of you know absent so I think the decentralized protocols could be much better than this for a global and privacy preserving way but an example is you know there there's like in China you can if you're listening to a podcast like you listen to the first ",
        "17": "five minutes for free and then it's like okay if you want to pay 50 cents you can listen to the rest of the podcast right it's a great monetization thing for podcasts like why have these ads that people have to listen to and whatnot um but they don't have that yet in the world because payments are too high friction like you know there's a on a credit card there's like a base fee and uh doing small small transactions doesn't really work real-time transactions don't work you know so that we could probably come up with dozens of examples like this um and I think that people are going to be streaming payments all over the place um and it could be even things we wouldn't even think of traditionally as a payment today right like if you're in a decentralized social World maybe if you're just hitting like the upvote button or the like button you know it's it's a small transaction or if artists are putting out their content on sort of like this imagine a decentralized version of Spotify or YouTube or X Twitter whatever um you know you could basically be doing microtransactions you could be buying you could have direct relationships with ",
        "18": "the fan and imagine your people these people are putting out their content and they're just watching funds like streaming in real time right so that's a powerful idea I think like Fred was talking about earlier the only transactions that really worked in D5 with layer one were things that you do infrequently like like borrowing and lending maybe a trade once in a while but there's lots of things in financial services that need cheaper faster payments and even going Beyond Financial Services think about all the interactions you have in web 2 if every if every button click or you know post or tweet or whatever was on chain we got to make that dramatically dramatically more scalable and so that's why it's important to keep focusing on these l2s seamlessly integrating them into the blockchains from a user user experience point of view they shouldn't even know they're using an L2 probably um and so that's why I'm excited about it I love it I love it and you um that's kind of l2's in in general what's your vision for bass ",
        "19": "um you know a lot of people have heard me talk about bass and kind of where we're going um what the plan is for decentralization what the plan is for kind of bringing users on board like how do you think about where where we're going with base over the next few years from your perspective yeah well I think you know it's great that it was incubated at coinbase but what's really important is that it it follows its path to decentralization over time and I think you know we've outlined some of that we'll outline more of it as we go along um it's important that we just we fulfill that commitment to decentralization I think um there's lots of pieces coming together just that blockchains provide like you know better property rights we can have stable currencies we can have better free trade globally um make some better you know equality of access to these different services so based on l2s generally I think we'll just be an accelerant on top of this um and our hope is that you know because it was incubated at coinbase we can help Shepherd it in a good direction where it moves quickly it's deeply integrated ",
        "20": "with lots of different developers and products around the world um it continues to ship improvements quickly where we get the the cost and the confirmation times down not just where it is today but hopefully you know another order of magnitude over time down as well so I'm hoping that you know the collaboration we've had with optimism by the way is really incredible and we're a huge shout out to them um the collaboration has been good and it allows it's allowing us to move very quickly with this uh particular L2 solution and we hope it gets broad adoption across every kind of product out there in the space yeah yeah and a huge plus one to that on optimism you know when we were just trying to kind of get started building an L2 we obviously uh thought about kind of how do we want to approach this and I think the the thing that was a North star for us was decentralization it's like how do we get this decentralized network incubated inside of a public company and then like fully decentralized over the next few years and as we were trying to figure out how to do that I think what we identified was having a partner having like a ",
        "21": "collaborator in doing who could kind of help lead the way on decentralization help kind of push those boundaries for us um and help us figure out our path was gonna be really valuable and I think that's where optimism has really kind of uh been a great collaborator for us you know they are on the other end of decentralization from us if we're the centralized public company or I mean it's a centralized public company optimism is the kind of decentralized dap that's doing next Generation governance um and they've really kind of pushed us forward uh and and made it possible for us to get started made it possible for us to keep base open and permissionless with this kind of neutrality commitment that we've made I think they're going to make it possible for us too um kind of continue accelerating the technical decentralization of base over the next few years so I you know it's been awesome for the last year and a half it's been uh I think really rewarding for our team to join as the second core developer of the op stack I'm really excited about what we're going to do in the years ahead Okay so we've talked a lot about base ",
        "22": "um I guess maybe one more question on base and then we'll switch a little bit to on-chain Summer um and kind of what's happening this summer uh so I guess last question on base is um you know like how have you felt about the response so far uh you know we've we launched the test in February uh we opened up for developers a month ago um here we are kind of face day one opening up for everyone yeah what's your experience with that Ben yeah I mean honestly I've been pretty Blown Away by the amount of support and interest I think the industry was just the community was really hungry for something that could turn this around you know we had a lot of bad news over the last year um and they were really excited to see a big company like coinbase jumping into something that could spark a lot of innovation and and not you know they're not like we're not launching our own coin around it or something like that so they felt like our intentions were really good around it um so we've had it's pretty incredible we've got about 100 dapps that are live and ready to go for the first day of main net that's pretty incredible ",
        "23": "um and it's this with on-chain Summer we're really kicking off this celebration which I'm hoping you all can be a part of um it's really a celebration of on-chain art culture music gaming all the different pieces that are coming together to um to be built on base and we've got a amazing set of partners that we're launching with so we've got a bunch of crypto native firms you know Zora open C parallel Blackbird uh We've also got a bunch of Legacy or I don't know you know traditional cup non-crypto companies I don't want to call them Legacy uh Coca-Cola Atari um so people can engage in a lot of you know real world utility at like restaurants or um you know minting a coke bottle but there's also a bunch of on-chain stuff um where people can start to engage and the goal is you know this is not the final iteration of course of what a base is going to be or or just on chain generally it's this is a moment for everybody to kind of get out go try it go kick the tires go go use one of these uh these use cases that we're putting out there for on-chain summer and the ",
        "24": "goal is to work out the bugs you know it there may be something about it that doesn't quite work perfectly like give us feedback you know send feedback to all the different um wallets and apps that are building on top of this because we've got to make this simple enough for the average person to just use it um without even understanding exactly which layer it's on underneath or the you know the computer science the cryptography they don't want to know about that stuff we're not going to get it to be a billion people without making it simple so go try it help us work out the bugs send feedback share it with your friends and I think that's how we'll start to kick off this utility phase of crypto over at Large 100 agreed And the tagline that we've kind of been iterating towards uh front in summer which I love is get on chain this summer that's it it's like do your first thing on chain and we you know over the next 23 days have kind of curated you know one thing that you can do every day uh there's a ton of other things happening that we didn't curate because bass is decentralized and open to everyone we're gonna be sharing those and rebroadcasting those so those are gonna ",
        "25": "be hundreds of other things that you can do I think the way that I think about this is like every single one of those things is a shot on goal and if you or your friend or your dad or your mom or your grandparents even just get one goal from those shots on ball where they get to try one thing that appeals to them whether it's music or food or art or gaming or social or messaging or Community like one thing that gets you to set up your first wallet that gets you to do your first transaction that gets you to experience what's happening on chain um and experience what you can create what you can do how you can participate I think that that's how we bring a billion people into this new world um by starting with one starting with one thing that people actually care about and they find interesting exciting yeah and Jesse there's no there's no hyphen in on chain right there's no hyphen in arcade you know we did a lot of conversations with press over the last couple days um as they kind of wanted to learn about ",
        "26": "10 summer they wanted to learn about base made in that day one um you know awesome response and like I think every article is all said on dash chain and so we're sending out those Corrections trying to change the language um for those who are maybe new to the terminology uh there's an ongoing conversation around should we compress on dash chain into one word on chain you see it right at the top of the um kind of video live stream here uh our thesis and our kind of perspective is yes we should um you know online started as on dash line uh that was before the internet became a thing and then as the internet really became a thing like we got rid of the dash because it looks better it feels better uh it sounds better although it sounds the same um and I think our thesis is like let's live in the future let's live in the future of the world where on chain is so integrated into our lives that it's not this hyphen thing instead it's just a word that kind of we we Embrace and it ",
        "27": "kind of makes uh yeah it makes it home it makes its home in our language um maybe that that's my perspective on Jane you mentioned in a chat we were shy the other day and you said I've started using on chain like what's your what's your word Journey over the last year well I mean this only came on my radar like you know a month ago or something but um there was I I that's how I feel about it too it's it's not two words it's it's a new word it's one word and so it when you're making when you're making a new thing happen it's helpful to have a word for it um and it shouldn't be two words hyphenated it's a new thing it's a new it's one word yep yep 100 agreed and if you're if you're looking to get on chain this summer uh you can scan this QR code which is in the bottom of the screen I'm like trying to point to it Brian can point to it too um it's done yeah there it is down there that'll take you to andreinesummer.xyz uh every day from now until the end of ",
        "28": "August uh we're gonna be kind of featuring one really cool thing to do on today um uh it's by a bunch of really incredible folks who've been building on chain on base uh and then we're also gonna be showing off all the incredible creativity that's already happening on base from the broader Community um so get on chain this summer at on-chain summer.xyz um bring your friends uh and show the world what's possible in this new uh generation of the internet that we're building okay couple more questions and then we'll wrap um let's talk about the far future right end of the decade right you know we've had this summer the first on-chained summer and then we have 100 summer every year through the end of the 2020s um where do you think we're gonna be uh what do you think that looks like yeah well definitely go scan that QR code if you haven't already and um you know the one Jesse pointed out and we'll we'd love to have you on the website there while we're finishing up and talking here um okay so what's going to be the future ",
        "29": "5-10 years out I mean I think bass is a great step in the right direction in terms of getting cost and time reduced by you know roughly an order of magnitude but we've got to go even further than that right how do we get every payment in crypto to be under one cent and under one second both time and money are sources of friction right and so we've actually set up a dashboard internally at coinbase where we look at all the transactions going through our products and the on-chain transactions and you can watch how many are going out every minute right and during certain periods it's higher from something slower and these are happening across a variety of blockchains that are primarily happening on L1 today and so we measure the end-to-end um experience of from the minute somebody hits send to the moment it's confirmed by the recipient not just received but confirmed how much time elapsed ",
        "30": "and what was the cost to the sender and it's way too high today um it depends on the Chain it depends on the time of day it depends on backlogs but it's on the order of 20 minutes or something like that to see final confirmation and um you know five to ten dollars or something like that at times right which is which is way too high it's crazy in order yeah so you know in computer science we like to talk about orders of magnitude right so one order of magnitude Improvement on that is good but it's not actually we're not yet into the one cent one second range you're gonna you're gonna need two or three orders of magnitude right and so there's a road map and these things are going to happen over time um but it's early days and that's where we need to get in the next five to ten years and as we do that we are going to see utility scale in crypto well beyond what you know what we've seen historically ",
