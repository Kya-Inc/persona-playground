        "0": "everybody i talked to actually thought it's a bad idea like any reasonable person would have quit i was filled with self-doubt and then coinbase was valued at a billion dollars crazy brian armstrong ceo co-founder of coinbase largest u.s cryptocurrency exchange i saw technology as a way to try to have a big impact on the world if the thing that got you started in the first place was like fear like fear of never being important or fear of never feeling fulfilled you're just gonna give up cryptocurrency is the biggest transformation of money since the invention of paper coinbase was being deemed the most trustworthy brand in crypto it tipped at a certain point from like oh this growth is really good to okay things are getting a little crazy here if you kind of more than double a company in a year you're really going to start to see a lot of stuff break this morning coinbase just telling employees in an email that it plans to lay off 18 of its workforce we had never done a layoff before i had never done one i remember i went up in for the company and my voice cracked i mean it was awful oh man i actually think coinbase is in deep ",
        "1": "trouble here and let me tell you why the pressure and the scrutiny and the headlines how are you dealing with your emotions this is getting very personal it's a real superpower to like care less what other people think so without further ado i'm stephen bartlett and this is the diary of a ceo i hope nobody's listening but if you are then please keep this to yourself [Music] brian i when i read through people's people's stories they're sometimes really obvious um causal factors that led them to become the people they are today but with you i'm i'm more compelled by the less obvious factors if we go back to your early years when you're a young man on the west coast yeah of the united states what are the the less obvious reasons as to why you've ended up where you are today and achieved what you've achieved in your life ",
        "2": "great question um one of the less obvious reasons probably is that i was an introvert i just wasn't really very good with people i didn't really have that many friends you know as a young person i was quite shy um i really found a love of computers and i liked just being by myself and playing with computers learning about how they worked programming and you know in our technological age i suppose um some of the people who got excited about computers early on and just have found a love of building things have now become you know ceos of companies which is kind of a strange thing for a long time i didn't think i could be a ceo because i envisioned ceos of companies as being like these military generals who barked orders at people and they were these like strong charismatic leaders and i always felt like well that's not me i'm kind of like an engineer i'm kind of a nerd you know and what i've learned over time is now reading enough books and things historically you know introverts can make actually really good ceos um of course by the way ",
        "3": "there's lots of different types of ceos there's not just one mold there's people who love marketing people have operations people who love sales people and then there are engineer ceos um so that's one reason that i think it's maybe a little bit less known why i'm here another another reason is that i just became very passionate about this idea of trying to have an impact on the world and i think it again may have come from that that introversion as a kid and i felt like hey i have good ideas but it's hard for me to get them out there and for people to listen to them and i didn't feel confident like you know speaking in some public setting or whatever i have lots of practice doing it now so i can i'm a well-trained introvert but um you know i saw technology as a way to try to have a big impact on the world and it could get my ideas out there in a scalable way even if i felt like maybe i couldn't and so i don't know maybe that's another un unlikely reason in hindsight then going back to those early years as well what was your luck or privilege what were the factors ",
        "4": "that were out of your control that happened to be the case that also aided to that um trajectory yeah i mean there was a lot of things that went right so i was in a home with loving parents that were very supportive of education and my passions and interests including you know my mother worked at ibm and so we had like an early computer in our home um she was kind of an early programmer there you know we had early access to internet things like that i also had you know i graduated studied i studied computer science and economics and i had um enough this was a very important thing i was not afraid to go try starting companies because i knew that if i failed i could actually go back and still get a job and it wasn't people always think of you know entrepreneurs oh they're such risk takers and all the stuff you know honestly it's not it's not that risky like if you're a young person and you get a little bit of money to go start a company like in in silicon valley people write you angel checks for these things and you can pay yourself a salary go try ",
        "5": "it for a couple years and it doesn't work you go back to a company and you it's often viewed as a badge of honor um that you've tried to start up you have this entrepreneurial dna you're somehow more valuable inside a company now if it doesn't work and you go back in many places in the world that's not the case you know failure of a company is considered a badge a mark of shame not a badge of honor and then i think many people don't have the luxury of being able to kind of raise these seed rounds and things like that which many places in the world you can't do that crypto is trying to help that by the way but in silicon valley you can get angel checks for things and so i tried starting many different things over the years as kind of as side projects but with coinbase specifically i didn't really i didn't even quit my job to try it full time until i had gotten sort of an angel investment so i was able to pay myself something it wasn't a lot but i was able to pay myself something and de-risk it um yeah if i'd asked you then at say 10 years old what you what you wanted to be when you grew up what would you have told me at 10 years old i mean i really i really had no idea i think the first ",
        "6": "glimmer of it that i had was in high school and i i had started building some websites and i remember as a senior in high school i went on this retreat and uh i had i do remember having this thought like the thing that has excited me the most in my life so far was i had built this kind of simple website or app and it felt like it was this really incredible feeling i went to sleep and i woke up in the morning and i checked the stats and like you know 200 people or something had visited the website while i was sleeping and i was like wow that was so cool i don't know who these people are they're all over the world it felt like a superpower like if i could build something that could be working and helping people while i was sleeping you know if not if not 200 people why not 2 000 2 million whatever and so i do remember having sort of a it's stuck in my memory like that of all the things i've tried in my life you know sports and reading and science and in school and whatever as a high schooler that was the thing that really got me excited in a way that nothing else had at that point so i was probably in the very early stages of discovering my passion at that point ",
        "7": "just just listening to you speak there my my brain was telling me that because i was trying to make this link between why being an introvert led you to technology and then also having this sort of desire to have impact but it sounds like there technology allowed you to be be an introvert and have impact because it was the the bridge between the the outside world yeah so when that website goes live you don't have to see these people or persuade them yeah but you can have your impact by by a piece of technology that's enabling something in their lives exactly you go off and study economics in university and yeah college yeah so i had been taking some programming classes um on the side in high school i couldn't help it i i i like in my free time i would just play with computers until like two in the morning three in the morning i was like dead tired at school every day because i was like wide awake at night like playing with computers learning about linux and like all these things and um school was a little bit boring in some ways so ",
        "8": "yeah i basically decided okay if i'm in this interested in computers my parents were supportive of this of course there was like community college classes and i went to go try to take some of those classes to learn programming there was i got some books from the library about like how to program java and things like that and i couldn't i couldn't understand any of it but i was trying to work my way through it so then when it came time to go to college i was basically like okay computer science that seems like the closest thing to what i'm interested in i was also interested in business and they didn't offer a business degree so i studied economics instead that was like the closest thing to a business degree they offered and that was literally my my thinking now of course i had no idea later i'd started crypto company which was literally the intersection of computer science and economics but yeah at the time i just thought i want to i want to write software and i want to learn how to start a business and at some point during college you start your first i guess real company yeah which is a tutoring business yeah was that did you have grand plans of turning that into a a mega was that or did you stumble into that ",
        "9": "more like stumbled into it yeah i mean so as a college student my roommates and i were always trying to think about how to make extra money and i went around and i was looking at these on-campus jobs so you could work at the library there was like a coffee shop and you know they paid like 10 15 an hour or something like that and one of the upper classmen i remember he told me you know i'm tutoring this high school kid and they're paying me 60 an hour i was like wow 60 an hour is it just it was like three or four x what you could make at these other on-campus jobs so i decided to try doing it myself i got in touch with some people i started tutoring high school kids just in like math and science and things like that and it paid really well and so my roommate and i at the time we were starting to just brainstorm like why don't we start a little tutoring company and help high school kids and their parents match with you know the you know tutors at the basically university students at the university where i was going to school and so we got that going we got maybe 10 20 of our of our fellow students kind of connected in and then we said all right let's make a ",
        "10": "website for this to connect even more people maybe try to expand it to other schools you know eventually over a period of a couple years this this idea just kept evolving and we started to think about it as we didn't really know this at the time but it was we were kind of making an online marketplace like airbnb for but but for tutoring and um yeah i got to practice like building web applications um there was payroll and incorporation and sales and marketing and taxes and um it i could never really get it to grow enormous and to make it become like a really big business which we can talk about if you want but that was the seed of it that later became a little bit more of a company why then why couldn't you make it become a big business what was the in hindsight the lesson yeah the barrier okay so we learned this sort of the hard way about creating a marketplace which was that in this particular industry in tutoring a lot of times uh you would introduce a student and a tutor and they would sort of we our business ",
        "11": "we were trying to take like a 10 fee by matching these people and we were basically trying to do all the payments through our website like billing and you know with a 10 fee and what would happen often is they would meet the tutor if and they'd do initially the first payment but then afterwards they'd start paying them under the table and so um we were i realized at a certain point we were basically just getting in the way they they wanted us to just match them but they didn't want us to be the whole billing apparatus it was a much more like a local repeat business in-person business and so for years and years i struggled with that there was a counterintuitive moment which allowed me to kind of pivot away from that so i eventually realized this thing isn't working i need to go get a quote-unquote real job and as i was going to start my the real job this was at um basically airbnb where i became an early employee i was i was about to shut down the tutoring site and i was like feeling a lot of pain about that because like well i don't know there are still like five ten thousand people every month who are kind of looking at this thing and using ",
        "12": "it it feels like such a pain to shut it down or such a bad thing so i was like what if what if i were just to put everything on autopilot you know we're not gonna be involved in any of the payments there's no customer support this is literally just going to be a directory like a tutoring directory and you can contact these tutors you can pay them however you want um and i'm just going to try to make it like a free thing maybe i'll put up some ads and so i basically had like a week before i was starting my my new job i got rid of all the payments i messaged all the people using it i was like you can pay now people directly and um i was gonna put up some ads and i did one more thing at the last hour which is i said if you want to have like a featured profile as a tutor with like a little badge on a featured badge and come up first in search results then you can just pay 10 a month and that was it and i basically stopped looking at the website and i went to go focus on my new job and every year thereafter the site doubled after i made that change um and so basically i guess the lesson was you know stop trying to extract value and start ",
        "13": "trying to create more value and at that point i think that was only the the only tutoring directory online that had free profiles and you could just contact the tutors and so it actually started to grow later later uh um somebody ended up acquiring it for maybe like two million dollars or something so to me that was like it was like a seven or eight year base hit the outcome yeah where for years you know five six years i was struggling to get anything to work but the the truth is okay they paid two million dollars for it yeah but the lessons you learn uh many of those translate into the business that you went on to build in coinbase what is there anything else because i look at my first startup that i made out of you know dropping out of university then started yeah and there's so many lessons one of them is what you said is i was i was so romantic about my hypothesis about what this business should be that i got in the way of what customers wanted to do yeah so hearing you say that really relates but is there anything else that you learned from that seven-year first you know kind of messy startup that of key philosophies for you today in ",
        "14": "coinbase i mean i think one of the big realizations i had in starting that tutoring company which again you can you can always look back and see how the the pieces connect but at the time you're just wandering in the desert you're lost like i felt i felt like i was a failure i felt like i had no idea what i even wanted to do i didn't even know if i wanted to be an entrepreneur it basically wasn't working but looking back with hindsight one thing i realized was how broken the global financial system was because it was incredibly difficult to collect money from all these students and pay these tutors not only in the us but in various places around the world and i remember um going through this pro like incredibly onerous process to like set up credit card processing and then payments that i was sending out and i remember the bank called me one day and they were like you know are you an aggregator of funds and i was like i don't even know what that is and they were basically like treating me like almost like i was a criminal and what are your licenses to do all this stuff and i was like this is crazy it was the hardest one of the ",
        "15": "hardest things about that business was just to get the payments like collecting payments and distributing payments to the tutors as a marketplace and so that gave me sort of a real insight later when i saw the bitcoin white paper years later i was like that system is broken um and this could be an opportunity to fix it so that was one thing what about airbnb so you went and worked as a in the product team at airbnb yeah yeah i was a technical product manager which basically meant i wrote some code and i tried to be a product manager yeah um yeah so i think i was the 40th employee at airbnb and i basically moved back to silicon valley from i was living in buenos aires argentina for a year or so trying to figure out what i wanted to do with my life okay i'm gonna have to talk about that sure yeah what did that give you that experience of travel and going to argentina and living there for how many years a little less than a year yeah what did that give you well it gave me a few things i mean one was that i got to see what a hyperinflation economy looked like you know a lot of people have only grown up grown up in a developed country they've never ",
        "16": "experienced hyperinflation and they've never felt firsthand what that can really do for a population and people so i would it really deeply affects the culture of places like argentina there's just there's kind of this deep distrust of um the government and there's a pessimism about about the future there's kind of you know in countries that i think are the most forward thinking there's a sense of optimism about the future hey we can build a better future and there's you know in places like argentina might you know people may disagree my impression was that people felt like the best days are behind us and live every day like it's your last because hey it could all disappear tomorrow meaning your wealth and everything which has happened many times in their history also just little things like you'd go to the restaurant the next week and the prices are higher and they put a sticker on top of the menu because the prices keep changing so so frequently it really it really harms like the poorest people in in society too because they they're the ones holding their wealth in cash as opposed to wealthy people can hold real estate things that adjust for inflation now they can hold bitcoin um so anyway it gave me a front row seat ",
        "17": "into that it probably gave me a little bit of a sense of confidence too because i had never studied abroad or really um lived in a foreign country by myself where i didn't really speak the language very well so there was things like that i think i was just trying to learn how to become more independent and grow up and stuff like that you were running the tutoring business at this point yeah i mean i was doing a lot of things so i was running the tutoring business i was um doing some contract software development just kind of while traveling i was trying to build some real estate investments in the in the us i i was basically trying to figure what i want to do with my life and there was a whole process i went through to try to figure that out if you're curious too the digital nomad piece which is becoming much more common these days because we've had this pandemic and we've kind of built systems which allow us to work more remotely and but just generally people were were choosing that lifestyle when i did that when i was 21 in the gap between my startup failing and then me pivoting into a new business i found it quite lonely and there was i remember being actually ",
        "18": "on a plane flying from one country to another brazil to thailand or something and seeing this um i think it was textiles or something like this san francisco incubator or new york-based incubate where they were building companies and i was i was living the dream in many people's eyes in these hot countries with my laptop but something inside me was like missing yeah um community a sense of shared mission whatever it is i wonder i wonder if you you can relate to that in any way or totally i i found it actually quite lonely as well so in in some ways that was the point which was to step outside my comfort zone feel like i had to make new friends in new city but yeah i mean there was a good you know maybe five six months there in buenos aires where i felt like i didn't really know that many people um i was feeling kind of homesick yeah eventually i tried to you know go meet some local people like expats like various hostels and like you know event by the time i left i felt like i had a budding friend group and i liked it more but it was lonely there for a while ",
        "19": "you said you used that time to figure out what you wanted to do with your life as if there's some kind of system there yeah i don't know if there's a perfect system but i mean i read this book by seth godin called the dip yeah i don't know if you've read it but and it's funny i went back to read it like many years later and it's actually a relatively simple book but in that moment in that time that's what i needed to hear and it's kind of a very fairly simple idea um which is that you know what's the thing that you would still want to be doing 10 years from now even if you hadn't seen a lot of success because most things in life you know you start off you're a beginner you have a fast pace of learning it's kind of fun but then after you after you're a beginner there's this dip in the middle where you're not an expert you're not one of the best people in the world you're probably not making money from it but you're not a beginner anymore and there's like this long slog to go through the middle you know put in your 10 000 hours there's lots of various people have talked about this so i was doing a variety of things at that time i was i was as i mentioned running that tutoring company doing some real estate investing i was like learning ",
        "20": "martial arts and like all the various things traveling in argentina and i and i basically sat down one day i was like what's this what is the thing that i 10 years from now i'm still going to want to do this and be passionate about it and even if i'm not successful at it you know because i just love doing it and like the only thing i could like really write on my list was tech entrepreneurship and so par part of the point of that book is if if you're not willing to go through the dip then then quit now because it's you know and so i was like do i really want to be like doing you know great real estate investments 10 years from i was like i don't actually love real estate investing so maybe i should have stopped doing that maybe i should stop doing this and maybe so it was this very clarifying moment okay if i want to be a tech entrepreneur because i had been doing that in some way shape or form for you know five ten years i was pretty sure i'd be wanting to do it ten years from now i was like why do i live in buenos aires i should go to where the the center of tech entrepreneurship of silicon valley you know that's happening all over the world now silicon valley is ",
        "21": "kind of decentralized but at that time especially so i kind of stopped doing everything else moved to silicon valley and went all in on that and then i think within maybe seven years of making that decision um coinbase was valued at a billion dollars crazy so it did really help clarify my ambitions and i just put it all into one thing that is atypical pointless yeah there's going to be entrepreneurs in bruenesaras listening to this that are bringing flights to san francisco but it could it could be any like if you really want to be an actor you should probably go to hollywood or something or if you really want to be in finance maybe go to london new york or anyway i think it's not so i don't want to say like there's one geography for everything but um there is a clarifying thing what happens if you just say this is what is the most important thing to me and i'm just gonna try to make luck my own luck around that it's so true it's something that i don't think especially young people think about when they're deciding making career choices they ",
        "22": "where to live is sometimes not um as prioritized as much as like which university has the best partying or who's offering me a job right now as opposed to that long-term horizon of like how do i surround myself with the most talent and opportunity and funding in the case of business um and inspiration and enablers um for this long-term vision i have and i spent some time in san francisco myself about three years and when i come back to the uk and when i go to other cities in the uk i i've never said this before but i see how much of a disadvantage we have in philosophy in ambition in funding in talent and um it's no surprise that most of the great unicorns that are emerging out of one city and in the world that then leads you to airbnb somehow through i think you take a job first then eventually take a job at airbnb yes exactly yeah i joined a y commenter startup that was really cool but it didn't really work out there was a brief interlude there but basically i i decided okay my tutoring company is not really working i need to ",
        "23": "and that's that's when i pivoted to that thing which had a base hit but what i decided all right i want to go to i want you to go to silicon valley i kind of want to apply to y combinator it's a startup incubator um but i wasn't able to get in and so i was like let me go work at a y combinator company to sort of learn and i need it by the way i also just needed to recharge a little bit because the tutoring company i've been living abroad the shooting company wasn't working i was barely paying myself anything so i was kind of broke i was i was also just exhausted um from the the tutoring company just not working after so many years of trying to get it to work um and you know it hadn't seen it double every year after that that happened on the side um and so i was like great let me take a job at a high growth company that seems to be well run actually make some money for a little bit here save some money and that's how i got to airbnb it just it had a really magnetic culture even at 40 people they had they were clearly onto something it had they had found product market fit it was growing quickly um and i learned a lot there they had a ",

        "89": "tech and all companies really it's not just even a tech thing it is it is more pronounced certain places in the world it's not it's not a broad thing geographically it's it's very pronounced in some cities um especially in the us but i guess probably somewhat here as well so notice much yeah i i i remember our ireland office like there were some people who messaged me during all that and they're like what is you just said like we're gonna work on work do work at work like what's what's so controversial they didn't it didn't make any sense um so it was it was largely a thing that happened i think in the bay area in the us and a couple other cities like maybe brooklyn portland places like that but um look i i don't you know in some ways i'd rather coinbase was like known for our product innovation and stuff this is a weird one because like we've actually been pretty become kind of well known for this stance and others have emulated it but the thing that really made me finally get the courage to do it because i i i didn't really want to make a public stance about this or whatever i just want everybody to get back to work but the reason i did it was that ",
        "90": "i felt like i had been a bad leader basically i had let this kind of misunderstanding accumulate inside the organization where people thought that it was okay to like come to work and just debate endlessly these things or like at the q a that we would host every week or two there would be a lot of questions that were not about our product or the regulators or the the future it would be about like these broader societal issues and these kind of these brush fires kept erupting in in slack channels and things and so oh and there and i think i reached a place where i was like i don't think i really want to be the ceo of this company if like this is what the ceo job entails is kind of like getting put on the spot with like um these crazy difficult societal questions every week i kind of want to just build cool stuff with technology and work on our mission and so i actually contemplated briefly i was like am i the one who's like just not sued for this job and maybe this is how companies are run now and a bunch of i talked to a bunch of friends of mine and people and they were like no like if if that's how you feel there's probably a bunch of other people the company who also feel that way ",
        "91": "and like you started this company you don't need to go they need to go and so it was if i realized i was like either i'm gonna resign or they're gonna need to resign and so at that point i was like all right they need to resign so we made we made an exit package available like i clarified the stance of the company five percent of the employees opted into that package and left and then after that it felt like the company was much more aligned and we were all able to move towards the mission um so it was cool to see some companies emulate it afterwards and there's probably a less dramatic way to do it you know if you kind of said it that way from the beginning but um yeah that's where we are one of the things that i really wanted to ask you about because from reading your blog post you have a very clear strategy and perspective on this and i also see this in hindsight as being the single most important thing that i ever had the responsibility of doing and getting right which is hiring people um i i up for the first three years i hired inexperienced people that were cheap and that i felt i could manage because i was 21 or 20. so i had a bunch of you like you want a job you want a job you want a job you can be director ",
        "92": "director of this yeah my biggest mistake i only learned when i hired someone good and i saw the net impact they had and the fact that good people then hired good people what advice would you give to people that are hiring now and how important do you consider hiring to be super important i mean actually in coinbase's values the number one value is top talent in every seat because it really everything in the company comes back to people like if you want to have a big impact you need to have generate a bunch of revenue and profit if you want good revenue property and you make good products if you make good products you have to have good people build them so it's actually everything comes back to people um so yeah i mean it's interesting to hear that you learned that lesson the hard way i've hiring is super hard sometimes the only way to learn a lesson is to actually go make the mistake and and do it but the mistake that a lot of startups make i think is that they hire too fast they treat the absence of any negatives as a reason to hire whereas it should be not just the absence of negatives but ",
        "93": "hell yes meaning like i learned something from this person they they're way better than me at something at least you know i left the interview with more energy than when i went in um i you know you can de-risk a lot of early hiring also by just having people come in and like try working together for a week or two interviews are actually really kind of a low signal thing you have to get real some people are great interviewers like maybe five percent of people can really assess someone in an interview most people aren't that good at it naturally and so you can basically use references or what we did in early days of coinbase we actually just had people try working with us for like a week or two a lot of people can't do that because they have an existing job but some people can and we you'll know you'll know within a week or two like this person basically delivered a bunch of stuff they got a bunch of stuff done that was useful and helped move the ball forward or they didn't like it needed me it needed me or someone else to come in and edit their work or curate it and like it's not to oversimplify it but basically like if the person can get a lot of stuff done that's advanced is the mission then you ",
        "94": "want them on the team and if they can't you shouldn't have them on the team and that's basically what makes great companies is like you have a bunch of people aligned toward a big impactful mission who can actually get a lot of stuff done every week and um you know you share some values in common and then everything else they can be quirky and weird and different and like from every background and walk of life and like everything else can be different but if you have those pieces right they get a lot of stuff done towards the mission and they're aligned then you got a good company you said about growing too fast i i saw you post recently that you you've grown the company too fast over the last couple of years and that you were having to cut back about 18 of the workforce yeah emotionally in those moments you know the statements were you were very transparent you were very honest you didn't have to publish that to the entire world but you did yeah emotionally what are those moments like does it get any easier for you to to to cut back the workforce when you you signaled in the memo that you take responsibility for that as well like you weren't skirting blame or anything ",
        "95": "so yeah so there's always something challenging every year that like really puts you out put you outside of your comfort zone and that's part of what i like about running a company is like you're constantly learning so so this year that was one of the things was like we had never done a layoff before i had never done one and um yeah i did kind of suck to look back and say um ah i actually made them stick you know we were everything everything crypto was so up and up and up last year that it it felt irresponsible not to keep hiring more people because we had like lines out our door you know virtually of like customers trying to sign up like institutional clients and new products and competitors and all these different markets and we were like we're just being reckless and irrational not to keep building the company with all this revenue we're generating and so but i think we found the breaking point and basically if you kind of more than double a company in a year you're really going to start to see a lot of stuff break the culture erodes um decision making is unclear communication channels break down and so we we definitely like exceeded that threshold last year in ",
        "96": "2021 and earlier this year we were on a pace to kind of keep going too quickly so you know it really it really kind of is a bad feeling to look at a problem and say oop i made a mistake but the only worst thing that is to like bury your head in the sand and pretend that you didn't make a mistake because you don't want to admit it or whatever and so um facing reality while it was deeply unpleasant and it was really unpleasant for the people that parted ways with the company um it was the right thing to do that now we have the ability to kind of learn how to operate really efficiently at this new size 5000 people still a lot and get a ton done with that and we got the cost structure to a place where we know that we can not only um have enough cash but like really thrive in this in this recession we're all going through at this point and whether that lasts one year or three years or four years whatever we're now we've set the company up to ensure that it has a better chance of accomplishing the mission long term so in a way although it was a super hard decision and it was tough for a lot of people involved it made me feel good ",

        "100": "most people disagree with you on hmm give you some time well i mean one kind of um contrarian view that i have that i think most people would disagree with is that um i think a lot of regulation is well intentioned and it actually causes more harm than good um you know it's not really probably a commonly held view in our society because a lot of people haven't tried to build something but if you've just only been an employee to company or you know consumed goods um when something bad happens in society people want to say what can we do to make sure that never happens again and so you create a rule it's sort of human nature right um but every rule has kind of these unintended consequences down the road um you know for instance uh in the cryptocurrency industry right like we're using kind of money transmission laws that were originated when there was like stage coaches moving cash between states and so in the united ",
        "101": "states we need to have 50 state licenses plus multiple federal licenses and that's just one small example you could actually go down many many many rules that are there in society they were created for a good reason at the time but they they've now accumulated so many of them that it makes it harder to get um to get innovation you know another good example just randomly is like in the us there's a the federal aviation administration regulates like airplane travel and things like that they've been incredibly successful at making airplane travel safe and so the fatality rates in air traffic and everything like that are airplane flights are very low but there's been an enormous cost to society as well around the lack of innovation so for instance like the boeing jets that we fly today they're very similar almost to the ones that were in like the 1960s that jfk flew on like you can't go faster because it's they they haven't allowed like people to break the sound barrier over over land um basically the things they're innovating on are like fuel economy and ",
        "102": "stuff like that and so it it does stifle a lot of innovation and so people don't think about that cost because they're more thinking about the acute short-term problem so i think it's a real risk that in society basically enough rules accumulate over time where it creates it throws sand in the gears of progress and um a lot of new innovation is harmed by um by regulation unfortunately even with good intentions brian thank you thank you for your time i realize you don't do things like this very often so it feels like even more of an honor for you to come here today and coinbase as i said i'm a customer of um it's it's always felt like the most trusted the safest way to involve myself in crypto and that's why i've always stayed with with coinbase and you as the ceo have a very um innovative approach to building a company in a new time in a new industry which i've learned from as a business owner myself so thank you for the inspiration thank you for your blog post as well i've sent many of them around to my company i think i sent two to all of my team today ",
