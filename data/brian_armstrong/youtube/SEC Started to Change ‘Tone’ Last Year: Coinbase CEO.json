        "0": "yeah coinbase and the SEC have been kind of in this months maybe years-long dispute here over uh defining a lot of the crypto environment and they brought a certain amount of charges against you to which your Chief legal officer yesterday told me that you guys are willing to fight this pretty significantly when you saw those charges brought against you what is the first thing you did and how how far do you think you're going to have to go here yeah well this was not um unexpected you know we've been in discussion with the SEC for a long long time even going back to before we were a public company we started sharing with them how we operate our business how we list assets on the platform how we think about our staking program and through a large number of dialogues back and forth they allowed us to become a public company um you know we had many discussions with them in the last year when their their tones started to change and they started to come to us with more questions about the business so we were very forthcoming we met with them probably 30 times over the last year and we started to kind of ask them ",
        "1": "for feedback and we said you know we would like there to be a robust Market in the U.S to trade crypto Securities of the thousand plus assets we've reviewed today we've rejected 90 of them the ones we've trade We Believe are Commodities what feedback do you have for this for us how can we come in and register how can we work together and unfortunately we were met with silence we really got no feedback in those 30 meetings um the first meeting where they were scheduled to come and give us feedback they canceled it a few days before that and then we got a Wells notice a few days after that so it's really unfortunate we work with Regulators all over the world other Regulators here in the US I think I'm a reasonable person to get along with but unfortunately the SEC under you know this chair has taken a regulation by enforcement approach instead of creating a clear rule book in the US that can allow this industry to be built in a safe and trusted way met with Gary Gensler and what did you say right so when he first came in as the ",
        "2": "chair um I I flew out to New York I made I reached out to him our team has reached out I tried to make an effort to connect with him in person because that's what I try to do whenever a new regulator kind of comes in um unfortunately we were not able to connect at that time I'm not sure why we couldn't get on his calendar um and we followed up a few times in the in the year after that we eventually got a meeting that was virtual you know it may have been coveted related or something like that but we were able to get a virtual meeting but unfortunately it was frankly like a pretty icy reception I would say um you know we sort of came in hat in hand and said hey chair Gensler you know you've asked people to come in and register respectfully we're here to register what would you like us to do what what um process would you like us to go through and his response was um you know talk to your lawyer I'm not here to advise you and that was kind of how the conversation started and so and at that point you know we realized um there was a gap you know we felt like this was an important technology that we felt needed to be built in a safe and ",
        "3": "trusted way here in the U.S in a way that consumers were protected and um I don't know what his motivations are or pers you know his personal views were but it didn't seem like he was on the same pitch so what does this mean for you if the government cracks down so hard on crypto on coinbase the SEC does coinbase exist in five years absolutely we do and I want to make an important point which is that the SEC chair may have a certain point of view but that's not representative of the whole US government in fact quite the opposite I would say um the SEC chair is a bit of a is really an outlier here kind of in the US government so when I meet with members of Congress I think the broad consensus probably amongst 80 of people I talk to both sides of the aisle it's a pretty it's a pretty reasonable view they have which is we don't know exactly what this technology is going to become but we're seeing every other major Financial Hub in the world move towards clear legislation we need to make sure that this Innovation happens in the US in a way ",
        "4": "that again let's just protect consumers let's apply some some basic good ideas around AML kyc and audited financial statements and make sure there's no wash Trading let's create a clear Market structure where you know businesses can understand which cftc SEC who should who should they talk to about which types of assets so Congress is is recognizing this and the the White House is as well actually the Biden Administration put out an executive order about a year ago kind of asking all the branches of government to sort of say get your act together on crypto we don't there's some risks but there's some real important opportunities with this technology let's create a clear regulatory framework will you fight this all the way to the Supreme Court do you think you'll have to and do you have the financial resources to do that yeah so um even if this takes some time you know that's okay um we we've so in q1 we've we're adjusted even a positive as a company even in the depths of this crypto bear Market if you want to call it that we have over five billion dollars of balance on the balance sheet right so um ",
        "5": "and and frankly even though that this complaint came in from the SEC it's really business as usual today right we're continuing to trade the assets that we have on our platform um you know we trade over 200 assets on our platform the SEC complaint mentioned just 13 of them so a relatively small percentage of the assets we trade we also have business overseas in other countries we we derive a lot of revenue from other sources that are not related to trading fees so um you know coinbase is well capitalized and adjusted even a positive in q1 I think we're going to be fine going to court in fact it's a relatively small portion of our company that you know we have a great legal team policy team et cetera that's working on this and what I really want you know 90 95 of the company to be focused on is is just building great products for our customers and making sure we don't lose sight of that and so this is a very serious matter that I'm going to work on with a couple of our Executives but really the vast majority of the company needs to keep building because that's how this technology is going to ultimately benefit a billion people ",
        "6": "hopefully how long does the regulatory overhang last the reality is this could take many many months and do you think that your investors might lose some Faith or even your customers while you go through this yeah well I mean look this is not a New Concept right um there's been lots of discussion the SEC has had rhetoric around this for several years that I think has influenced the market um and so the investors in the coinbase are you know comfortable with that if they're because they're it's all public right it's not like some secret thing that's being revealed um and I think they're taking a long-term view that coinbase is a very different company we're kind of in an end of one right we're we're really the only company that was based here in the US that went public that has audited financial statements that's taken a compliance first approach um you know even in this recent SEC complaint by the way that came out yesterday it was unfortunate they sort of did it back to back with other another complaint that went out there and you know that may have been intentional to try to conflate the two but I think people are smarter than that ",
        "7": "and they recognize that um you know this complaint against coinbase there were no allegations no allegations of misappropriation of customer funds there was no allegations of wash trading you know myself and the executive team were not named personally it's really debating this more technical legal question of are some of these assets Commodities or are they Securities and I think that's something the court will have to decide to sort of get some legal press some case law out there which will ultimately benefit us because we that's what we've been asking the SEC for for a long time is how do we get more clarity so if we need to go to the courts to do it it's not our first choice we'd rather the regular had just published a clearer rule book but if they're not going to do that the courts are there in the U.S to Avail ourselves of so part of this was about Securities being registered or not in terms of how they're listed on your exchange but part of this was about staking also so staking obviously is becoming a more important part of the crypto ecosystem do you plan based on how The Regulators ",
        "8": "are treating staking to wind down your staking service no we're not going to wind down our staking service again as these court cases play out it's really business as usual we're going to continue to operate that you know snake staking only represents about three percent of our net revenue but it is a it's a very important function in the crypto community and it serves an important part of these decentralized blockchains and I guess I should mention also that you know coinbase's staking product is is architected and built in a way to be compliant and we've actually think it's materially different than some of the other ones out there which have been called staking and so yeah we're going to continue to operate our staking business so so if users wanted their funds back in the staking service at this point in time does coinbase have the ability to service that at scale in case that there is a larger run on the staking business yeah so um you know staking is really something that's a decentralized part part of these decentralized protocols so ",
        "9": "coinbase is really just um you know it's a pass-through mechanism we're helping people access these decentralized protocols so some of the decentralized protocols have for instance like a lock-up period of you know some number of days when you initiate the withdrawal request and so we're just making that kind of information available to the customer but it's yeah you know all the the funds are there backed one to one that when you're when you're staking something it's being pledged into these these decentralized protocols and we actually don't even have the ability to you know move it somewhere else at that point it's um we're just giving people access to these decentralized protocols so the business face have a material impact on ethereum's price how does Columbia prepare for something like that um what do you mean is there kind of a broader run that you have to be prepared for oh well okay so in in our business we're not we're not a bank right we don't do fractional Reserve um and so there's not really this concept of a run right all the all the funds are there backed one to one and you don't have to take our word for it ",
        "10": "you know our as a public company we have Auditors Deloitte in this case who's gone in and verified all of that you can kind of confirm it in our financial statement so um you know if people want to withdraw funds they 100 of it is there there's no such thing as a run really so how do you answer the question of you know on one hand there is SEC that is uh you know causing a big overhand in terms of both you guys and the industry on the other hand just financially you know rates are higher in the United States people are more inclined to keep their money in a bank why should they keep their money with you well what's interesting in crypto um there's been the evolution of something called stable coins right and so um we're actually uh in Consortium with another company in the circle in the space we've we've created a USD coin which is the second largest stable coin out there and as you mentioned interest rates in this environment that's been both a good source of revenue for us but it's also something that we've passed along to customers so customers can actually earn rewards on usdc ",
        "11": "um and get get access to some of these higher interest rate environments broader question not just about coinbase but about the industry as you know more regulatory enforcement actions come to the Forefront how much of an overhang do you think that will have on crypto pricing you know it's hard for me to say it was actually kind of surprising yesterday with with this complaint that came out crypto was up um which I would not have expected so I don't know what to make of that I don't know if it means that people knew something was coming but they expected it to be worse than it than it actually was or um um if they just felt that you know they're they're still a believer in it or something but you know I I don't try to predict what's going to happen in these markets you know we don't operate a hedge fund or anything like that um we just want to provide a good service to our customers around the exchange and all the products we offer before I look about not crypto I want to ask about artificial intelligence even talking about it all day as a crypto entrepreneur how do you see uh AI do you ",
        "12": "see it as a competing factor in terms of dollars going towards technology do you see dovetailing with your industry at all well AI is certainly one of those couple really important technology trends that the US needs to get right along with crypto and I think we're seeing a similar question start to happen in Congress along with crypto is like hey how should this be regulated so it can be done in a safe trusted way um I do think there's a couple interesting intersections between Ai and crypto one of them is that you know in the world of AI there it you know it's so easy to mass generate things whether it's a news article or images um and so the provenance of those and the authenticity of it can be a little bit hard to figure out and in a world of crypto one of the great things about crypto you know with nfts and whatnot you can actually have a digital signature that proves um you know this was issued by Bloomberg or um by Brian Armstrong or whoever so I think it could be useful to track the provenance of creative Works whether that's text audio video Etc the other ",
        "13": "thing that might be interesting is that a lot of these these you know Bots or autonomous agents um in the AI sphere they're going to need to go get things done in the world right people are already using them to sort of say hey order my groceries or you know maybe build this website and spin up this server and so they're going to need um Financial money they're gonna need money to go do things in the world these these AI agents and so I think that actually in the future you're probably going to see a lot of crypto transactions happening between AI agents or Ai and various businesses around the world because crypto is kind of the Native money of the internet the internet internet is global it's decentralized every country everybody in the world can participate in it and so it wouldn't really make sense to use um you know the dollar or the euro in a truly Global context if you you know what you want to be country agnostic so I think AI will use crypto more much are you actually working on that future here so our we're not trying to build ",
        "14": "something that is um allowing Bots to like transact in crypto at the moment but what we are doing is we're building good infrastructure you know picks and shovels if you will so with coinbase Cloud for instance um we're making our apis around how crypto is stored and transacted and commerce happens and we're just exposing those kind of like Amazon web services but to any business that wants to integrate it so I suspect more businesses will integrate that over time and some of those may use AI we're also using AI in our business in a few other ways I mean we use it a lot for fraud prevention um you know unfortunately we get people signing up putting in stolen credentials and things like that and so we've developed a lot of really good machine learning to detect that and um you know we're occasionally we're testing it in a few other areas too just like around actually like you know our design teams um they'll sometimes look at mid-journey or Dolly and sort of generate an interface using AI at least like you know show me five ideas for what an interface space might look like to do remittances in crypto or for Content ",
        "15": "creators to have a direct relationship with their audience and what would the interface for that and AI is just like a great assistant you know it doesn't I don't think AI really is taking people's jobs it's taking tasks off their plates largely to make their jobs more efficient and so um having like a you know a research assistant or someone like that you know a tutor a mentor or a therapist whatever everybody can have one of these um paired with them and I think it'll just make humans more productive "
