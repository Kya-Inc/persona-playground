        "0": "to the chair other Commissioners and staff of the Securities Exchange Commission I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak directly to you my name is Paul Grewal I'm coinbase's Chief legal officer and with me is Brian Armstrong the chief executive officer and chairman of coinbase I'd like to start by turning things over to Brian to say a few words Brian yeah thanks Paul so again thank you for the opportunity to respond to this Wells notice and I thought I'd share a few words just about the founding story of coinbase and why I decided to base it here in the US and how we've practically sought out compliance over the last 11 years so back in 2012 I had just read the Bitcoin white paper and you know something clicked in my head when I first read this that this might be a very important technology breakthrough that could help update the financial system globally you know I had a first-hand experience seeing how difficult and challenging certain aspects of the financial system were I had been a software engineer at Airbnb and I had seen how difficult it was to send and receive payments globally to ",
        "1": "190 countries it was slow and expensive and difficult I had lived in Argentina actually for a year studying abroad and working abroad and I had seen what a country looked like that had gone through hyperinflation where people had lost trust in the currency and they didn't have access to Good Financial Services they couldn't get loans for instance to buy a car or a home and so when I read the Bitcoin white paper I thought this might be an important breakthrough something on the order of what we saw with the internet a new Global and decentralized system that could make it easier for people to transmit value and update Financial Services globally the next decision I had was where do I want to start this company once once I realized I wanted to start a company and you know I went to some early Bitcoin meetups in San Francisco and people were telling me you know you shouldn't base it in the US it's going to be too challenging there's 50 state regulators and multiple Federal regulators and you should start in Hong Kong or Singapore and there was other firms that were starting at that time that did that but I made the choice at that moment to ",
        "2": "start the company in the US because I knew that even if it was more difficult the US was a major Market there was respect for rule of law the US was a financial Hub a technology Hub it was a place where I felt entrepreneurs could work in good faith with Regulators to help Define clear rules for new Industries as they emerged and so I was lucky enough to raise some Venture Capital money you know the Prototype on my laptop nights and weekends turned into a small company and we went off to the races you know 11 years later fast forward this strategy of proactively working with Regulators in in cases where it really wasn't clear what we should do because it was a new history we tried to do the right thing in the absence of clarity and demonstrate good faith effort that would allow us to bring this technology in a safe and thoughtful way to hopefully a billion people someday so here we are as a public company I think we've made enormous strides and I think the message I'd really like to leave with the Commissioners and the SEC is that we're committed to working in within the regulatory perimeter we want to see a ",
        "3": "clear Market structure for trading crypto Securities not all crypto assets are securities there's also crypto Commodities there's stable coins there's crypto that's artwork we're going to work with multiple Regulators to make this industry safe and trusted and a Wells notice at this stage when there is not a clear rule book is not constructive and it's not good for America we are prepared to defend that position in court but it doesn't have to come to that we welcome a true dialogue about a workable path forward for our industry now I'll hand it back over to Paul coindes has been talking to the SEC about our business for many years now including sharing our legal views on our asset listing and staking Services we have repeatedly asked the SEC for its own views on how Securities laws might apply to coinbase and our industry and to be candid we've mostly gotten silence in response but we were very proud when two years ago in April 2021 the SEC declared effective coinbased ",
        "4": "registration statement allowing coinbase shares to be sold to millions of retail investors that moment came after months and months of review by the SEC the SEC asked a lot of questions about our business and our services which looks very much like the business we have today and we answer those questions in detail that included questions about our asset listing our staking service coinbase wallet and all the legal analysis we've done related to those products we understand that new technology can pose challenges for Regulators we understand new laws are sometimes needed that is why coinbase's core commitment to regulatory compliance has never wavered we welcome new regulation but we believe that regulation needs to be created in a fair way and shared with the public I understand that the Well's notice means that the staff has reached a preliminary determination that aspects of our company's Core Business violate Securities laws so I want to be very direct with you coinbase does not list Securities we use a robust process based ",
        "5": "on SEC guidance to make sure that we don't list Securities we reject some 90 percent of the assets that we review it might be better for our short-term business to be less conservative than we are but that is not who we want to be as a company that's why as proud as we were when we became a U.S public company just two years ago we were just as disappointed to receive the wells notice from the SEC a few weeks ago in the past two years coinbase's business really has not changed in any fundamental way we remain just as committed to following the rules and engaging collaboratively with the SEC on the best way to regulate our industry but we ask that those rules do not change mid-stream and without any notice to the industry as Brian said coinbase has approach to regulation hasn't changed the law itself has not changed either even though we would welcome legislation or rulemaking for our industry so what has changed when coinbase became a public company the view of the SEC appeared to be that ",
        "6": "the SEC lacked statutory authority to regulate businesses like coinbase in May 2021 just one month after we became a public company that's what chair Gensler testified to Congress he said quote the exchanges trading in these crypto assets do not have a regulatory framework either at the SEC or our sister agency the cftc and the very next day he said the SEC would work with Congress to develop such a framework specifically he said the SEC will be working with Congress if they see fit to try to bring some protection the wells notice we received appears to say the opposite just two years later as the SEC staff contends the significant aspects of coinbase's businesses are now subject to and violate Federal Securities laws this new view doesn't come from any change in coinbase's business since becoming a public company two years ago coinbase is at its core the very same company today that we were on April 14 ",
        "7": "2021. nor does this new view come from the SEC staff's discovery of something that coinbase concealed or misrepresented in our extensive engagement with the SEC including during the registration process absolutely nothing like that has been suggested so what accounts for this change in December 2022 following the collapse of FTX a digital asset trading platform that is entirely dissimilar to coinbase the SEC appears to have adopted a new view that month chair Gensler said in an interview I feel that we have enough Authority I really do in this space to regulate crypto companies of course in the time between this statement and the prior ones Congress did not pass any new legislation to fill the statutory void that chair Gensler previously acknowledged and the SEC has not tried to fill the void itself through rulemaking even though the industry and coinbase specifically have repeatedly and formally requested that the SEC do so ",
        "8": "to be candid this is pretty startling for coinbase as a compliant U.S public company to watch unfold and it is all the more startling given the different views expressed by other regulators the cftc has recently formally identified Bitcoin ethereum Litecoin and usdc and other stable coins as Commodities not securities when the Department of Justice charged a former coinbase employee for improperly front-running asset listing decisions it declined to bring any Securities related charges meanwhile coinbase is regulated for example coinbase holds a bit license from New York Department of Financial Services and part of that bit license means we cannot and do not list Securities on our platform we believe that legislation or rulemaking is needed if the SEC wants to expand its oversight of our industry a specially contrary to the views of other federal and state Regulators but regardless we remain ready willing and eager to engage with the SEC on any topic about how ",
        "9": "Securities laws can or should apply to our industry just last summer the SEC asked coinbase to develop a proposal for crypto companies to register with the SEC if and that's an important if they want to list securities coinbase does not list Securities today but we would like to do so using an SEC registered platform and we certainly would like to get rid of the cloud now hanging over our industry given the sec's new view of its jurisdiction over our industry but it's not clear how that view applies in practice to specific products and services so we said absolutely yes to the sec's request to work on a framework for crypto companies to register and after months and months of coinbase sharing ideas with the SEC on the eve of the meeting where the SEC had promised to give us feedback and its views for the first time instead the SEC call off the discussions all together a few weeks later after just two cursory depositions we got a broad yet fundamentally vague ",
        "10": "Wells notice we still do not know exactly what it is that we do that is of concern to the SEC ultimately as chair Gensler told Congress less than two years ago today no law or regulation authorizes the SEC to charge coinbase for the alleged violations in the wells notice no law at all so we are on the brink of a fight that doesn't need to happen and frankly shouldn't happen at a time when we could be working together to provide Clarity and stability to an important new industry for consumers and investors not to mention the US economy as a whole we are instead gearing up for litigation coinbase does not want to litigate against the SEC and the SEC should not want to litigate this case either litigation will put the sec's own actions on trial a road public trust in the sec's mission undermine any incentive for Market participants to engage with the SEC and put at risk broad aspects of the sec's enforcement ",
        "11": "program so we're asking you directly not to waste the sec's limited and important resources on unnecessary litigation that will only harm the very investors that the SEC is Mission bound to protect the SEC has other productive options available to it if the SEC believes that certain digital assets are securities or certain parts of coinbase's business should be registered coinbase continues to welcome that dialogue at a minimum those assets need to be identified we know that chair Gensler has said that he believes most digital assets are securities but even if that were true coinbase does not list most assets we reject more than 90 percent of the assets considered for listing and there are mountains more that we don't consider at all the better path here is for the SEC to initiate rule making or at least respond to coinbase's pending petition for rulemaking if the SEC believes that coinbase should set up a registered Securities trading ",
        "12": "platform for certain parts of its business coinbase is open to that discussion too but it must be rooted in a fair and proper application of Securities laws and there must be an actual path to register which does not exist today coinbase will defend itself vigorously in litigation if it comes to that but it does not have to come to that we will show up at your offices any day anytime to discuss a workable path forward for our industry but we won't find that path without true dialogue I'd like to again thank the chair Commissioners and staff of the SEC for your time and careful consideration of these important issues and with that I'd like to turn things back over to Brian for a final word thanks Paul so I'll just end with a closing thought here which is that coinbase has always been committed to being built in the U.S within the regulatory perimeter we've proactively sought out regulation and we're committed to working with Regulators all over the world a Wells notice to the company at this ",
        "13": "stage is not constructive and it's not in America's interests there are many aspects of the current rules which really are not clear for operating a crypto business in the US our petition to the SEC made those points and I think it deserves a thoughtful and clear response and dialogue with the industry so we would like to continue to work with you to make a a regulated market for crypto Securities to be traded in the U.S I think our interests are aligned in doing that and we hope that that's the path that we can go down versus a path of litigation and enforcement thank you foreign "
