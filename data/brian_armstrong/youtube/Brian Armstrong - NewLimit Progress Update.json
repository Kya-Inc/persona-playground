        "0": "all right everyone thank you for coming I think we're starting the live stream there in the back I'll wait for the thumbs up but welcome to New limits progress updates we're glad to have you here we're doing something a little atypical for a biotech which is we're going to talk about what we're doing in public and we're doing that both for a recruiting event here but also to get your feedback on what we could be doing better so thanks for joining all right so what's the origin story um back in 2021 coinbase went public and it was a great event for lots of people and when I started to have more money I started to think about what are the big problems in the world that needed more funding there's lots of good teams working on the hard problems out there you know if you've made some money in software I think you have a go from bits to atoms I think everybody has a good responsibility to do that and so there's already good teams working on Fusion Energy and brain machine interfaces and going to Mars but I thought you know aging biotech I haven't seen as much happening there and I reached out to my ",
        "1": "friend Blake Byers we started hosting some dinners we invited the best you know scientists and biotech CEOs we could find we go around the dinner table we say what's the most exciting thing on the horizon that you feel like isn't getting enough attention and funding and this idea of epigenetic reprogramming kept coming up Blake and I started doing some more reading met all the top scientists in the space fast forward six months we were lucky enough to meet Jacob Kimmel and Greg Johnson the co-founders and um a company was born so the key Insight that we had was that most diseases out there whether it's Dementia or heart disease or cancer diabetes the big killers these are all highly correlated with age and so it kind of makes sense when you're young you're in your 20s and your 30s you get some sort of insult to the body whether that's inflammation or DNA damage and your body has the ability to repair itself but as you get older you kind of fall victim to these things and all these diseases come in with age and so what if there was an opportunity to kind of attack the root cause of all of these ",
        "2": "diseases that would be pretty amazing and so new limit is attempting something very ambitious here we're gonna we're gonna talk later about this you know I think it's important for companies to have big ambitious missions but we also want to have more near-term opportunities for revenue and more realistic milestones and so Blake's going to talk about that later but what we're actually doing is we're inventing these therapies which treat these diseases of aging and it's based on this idea of epigenetic reprogramming or partial reprogramming so here's a quick primer one slide for many of you this is going to be very obvious but um you know epigenetics what is it well every cell in our body has the same DNA whether it's a skin cell a brain cell a muscle cell it's the exact same three billion base pairs but what makes those cells different is what genes are actually turned on and off the ones that are expressed so you can think of epigenetics as these little markers on the DNA that tell the cell which genes are being are on or off and as we get older sometimes the information gets a little bit deteriorated as we as we get ",
        "3": "older and so this is one of the theories of Aging is this epigenetic Theory where you know instead of our cells accumulating damage that's somehow irreversible it's actually the epigenetic data you know a gene that's supposed to be off is on or or the opposite and it slowly starts to lose its function as we age now there's something really interesting about this epigenetic Theory of Aging which is that in the past when we had a Theory of Aging we had to test it with you know animal models and we'd have to make some kind of therapy to that animal wait a few years see if it died earlier or later and it took a long long time but with this Theory we can actually test individual cells themselves which means we can test this at a scale that's never been done before and that often helps get breakthroughs if you look you know at other things in the past the other really important thing about this is that we already have an existence proof that age can be reversed through epigenetic changes alone this isn't a completely crazy idea and if you think about it um you know all of us start life as as an embryonic ",
        "4": "cell here we get older we eventually you know age and there's other teams um not not here at new limit but this is all prior work we're standing on the shoulders of giants here um they've been able to take a skin cell from an aged Mouse and through epigenetic reprogramming turn it back to this embryonic stem cell and that and it can help make a mouse with its whole life ahead of it they can do this on repeat you know at generation after generation after generation and so this is pretty profound if you think about it it shows that this aged cell in a mouse there's not some accumulated damage in there that's irreversible we can actually turn it back into a new mouse with its whole life ahead of it and so our cells are actually quite plastic and it's not just mice um if you think about it humans have been doing this you know as long as we've existed where a sperm in an egg cell no matter whether you're 20 or 40 or 60 when you have children you can you know create a cell of a new human with its entire life ahead of it and so it's this is at least some kind of existence proof that you know age reversal is built into our art biology and it's not just the ",
        "5": "reproductive cells either got the Nobel Prize in 2006. for showing you could take this aged skin cell and turn it into this young embryonic stem cell and you know of of the three billion base pairs of DNA and the 1700 transcription factors in the human body uh he was able to find just these four transcription factors these proteins kind of like a secret code out of those that huge number or a password almost that he cracked and if you expose the cell to those four you can change both the cell age and the cell type this will become important in a minute subsequently people have been able to show that you know you can change just the cell type but not to sell age so instead of moving along the X and the y-axis you can move just along the y-axis turn a skin cell into a liver cell a neuron a vascular cell and again they found novel transcription factors maybe one to six in these examples that would again change one cell into a different type and so what new limit is doing is we're ",
        "6": "trying to change just the cell age without changing the cell type and to do that we need to look for novel transcription factors if you think about it it would actually be a little bit surprising maybe if we were able to change both cell age and cell type and just cell type on the y-axis if it was not possible to do it just on the x-axis that would be a little bit surprising but this is certainly an ambitious goal and there's a big big search space of transcription factors I mentioned earlier there's 1700 transcription factors in the human body let's say we were really smart and we we got managed to narrow that down to maybe 400 . if you take uh how many combinations of five out of those 400 it's a huge number right 10 to the 10. this is a massive search space more than can be done you know manually in a lab dish by dish even with Automation and so we're going to have to develop novel ways to search something this big and we both need to get really smart at choosing um you know which experiments to run and also do it at a scale that probably has ",
        "7": "never been done before so I'm going to invite the team up here in a minute and you're going to hear from each of the key members of the team we're going to talk about what we're building at new limit it's a discovery engine that is going to hopefully enable us to search this space in a way that hasn't been done before and um just to wrap up I think you know I wanted to touch on why are we why are we up here why are we so excited about this why are we working on this well you know one thing is that I think there's a huge moral imperative to work on Aging roughly 56 million people die every year from aging and you know in any other context that would be considered an incredible tragedy probably the most important thing happening on the planet but because it's happening to aging it's sort of hiding in plain sight we're desensitized to it and we don't think about it the other reason is maybe a little more out there which is that you know we're seeing the birth of AI and I think eventually we may actually be in some kind of competition with digital life and biological life and we need to make sure biological life continues to improve in advance it gets better and ",
        "8": "hopefully maybe eventually even integrates with AI so I guess in that sense new limit is a bit of a transhumanist company so with that I'll bring us back down to earth and I'm going to introduce Jacob Kimmel our head of research at new limit to talk you through our discovery engine "
