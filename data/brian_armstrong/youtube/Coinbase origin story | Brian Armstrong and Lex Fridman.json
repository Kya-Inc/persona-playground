        "0": "you started coinbase when bitcoin was ten dollars yeah um and you just mentioned an incredible system with security with transactions everything is thought through there's a lot going on but what was version one back in those early days the first prototype of coinbase what did that look like yeah like what what did it take to write it to think through it and and uh make it work enough to at least make you believe that it's going to work well i definitely didn't know if it was going to work i mean it was kind of i felt like i was just following my gut so i mean i was working at airbnb i was a software engineer there project manager i was working on some fraud prevention stuff for instance and um i read the bitcoin white paper in kind of december of 2010 i started going to some bitcoin meetups in the bay area um met lots of interesting people there like crazy people anarchists you know like really brilliant people all the ",
        "1": "above and so i started nights and weekends trying to hack put together a prototype and my initial thought was well you know smtp is a protocol that runs email and you know git is is a protocol for version control that and but people made like gmail and github they don't most people don't want to run their own email server or even their own git server they just want to like use a hosted thing that you know will do all the security and backups for them so the thought in my head at that time was bitcoin's this new protocol there's probably going to be somebody who makes a hosted service that does all the security and backups for you makes bitcoin as a protocol easy to use so maybe i should maybe i should make like a hosted bitcoin wallet or something that would that was my it was gonna make gmail for bitcoin or something and a bunch of people told me that was a bad idea like bunch most of my smart friends when i told about it they were like well first of all i don't really get what you're doing at all like bitcoin sounds like a scam or something you got you've gotten involved in um but then other people who understood what bitcoin was told me i thought it ",
        "2": "was a dumb idea because they're like dude if you store all this bitcoin you're just gonna get hacked like nobody you know why would you why would you do that and so i i kind of had this thought like you know what i'm not going to go all in and like make a story everyone's bitcoin that would be too much right now i have a job i have a day job you know but let me just make a prototype and i'll tell people this is like a beta thing like don't put any real money in it and just see if there's interest and if i feel like i'm onto something maybe i'll go do this as a company because i did i really wanted to be an entrepreneur at that time i was like i was 29 i was almost turning 30 and i was i always wanted to like start a company but i was i was you know i wasn't yet i was an employee at a company that was great but so anyway i had this prototype i was hacking together nice and weekends i actually wrote a whole bitcoin node in ruby which turned out to be a maybe a weird decision in hindsight because ruby wasn't the most performant language we've subsequently had to rebuild that many times but yeah i had this hosted bitcoin wallet and the thing that i didn't have any users for it by the way i applied to y ",
        "3": "combinator because i was like maybe if somebody there writes me a check this will like make it feel like a real company and i was trying to find i was trying to find a co-founder at that time unsuccessfully so i was basically just wandering in the desert i had a lot of self-doubt about this because i i was like i don't know all my friends don't think's just kind of dumb and maybe bitcoin is just going to get shut down and like this all be some stupid thing so there was definitely a feeling of just wandering lost in the desert lots of self-doubt um paul graham and the y combinator group kind of wrote me the first check after i went and interviewed and stuff and they they wrote me a check for like 150k and that was the first time somebody who i really looked up to kind of said this is this is worth pursuing like maybe maybe you're onto something maybe or not but like let's at least try it and so i that was kind of what gave me the confidence to quit my job and try it and um i'll wrap the story here by saying that like we i you know i found the right co-founder after y combinator we still didn't have any customers the thing that you know i basically launched the hosted bitcoin wallet ",
        "4": "there were people signing up um i just posted on reddit and places like that and you know maybe like 100 people would sign up and then nobody would come back and so i was like i just in y commented they often tell you like you know talk to your customers and improve your product talk to your customers improve your product that's all you're supposed to be doing try to find product market fit so i emailed like five of the users that had signed up and i was like hey i worked on this app i saw you signed up can i get on the phone with you i get on the phone with like five of these folks and i was like you know why didn't you come back and the guy was like well the app was okay for a for a beta but um like i don't have any bitcoins so i didn't really know what to do with it and i remember this light bulb kind of went off my head i was like well if i put a buy bitcoin button in there uh would you have used it and he was like yeah maybe so then i had this we went about the process my co-founder at that time we like got basically had to get like a bank partnership payment rails you know an exchange basic exchange functionality all that stuff i was mentioning earlier in place and the minute we launched that feature where you could just click buy put in ",
        "5": "your bank counter credit card buy it buy bitcoin it showed up in your account from that day forward like the number of users started go up like this and so we finally had found product market fit after two years of wandering in the desert so you weren't even thinking about to buy the on-ramps you would think it would be just the wall a place to store bitcoin that you've already gotten yeah okay this is i mean uh because that's such a pain to do to have to work with others to convert dollars of any fiat currency into into bitcoin yeah so did you i mean were you uh overwhelmed by the immensity of the task here or where you just um sort of not allowing yourself to think too deeply through this whole thing and just letting the optimism take over here you know i was really looking forward to like doing something crazy and like a big challenge and um i wanted to i i love kind of ",
        "6": "crisis moments like that where you know i'm very determined right especially when i i get like very set on something and i'm just like you know what i'm gonna figure out a way to make this [ __ ] thing work like no matter what and so i i reveled in that i i was sort of i had i had read all these books about startups and like every startup has these like you know major setbacks and just like nothing works and so that was a sign that you're doing something right i had no idea if i was doing anything right at all but i was like i was kind of loving the experience of it in a weird way it felt it felt stressful at the time like you know nothing was working and but i was just i felt like i was on the right path somehow and so i just kept going ",
