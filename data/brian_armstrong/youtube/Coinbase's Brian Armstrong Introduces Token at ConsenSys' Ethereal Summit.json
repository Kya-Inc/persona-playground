        "0": "[Music] [Music] please welcome CEO and co-founder of coinbase Brian Armstrong let me introduce you to Ronald Ronald is a student in Uganda and he can't afford to pay for his education and he can't get a loan but he does have something in his pocket that all of us in this room have and that is a smart phone according to the Gates Foundation there's 2.5 billion people in the world just like Ronald who have a cell phone but they don't have access to financial services that's a huge number of people ",
        "1": "who are unable to lift themselves out of poverty by saving money or getting a loan today I'm going to tell you about how digital currency can help bring financial services to these 2.5 billion in the people in the world just like Ronald and from their grow to the rest of the world so who am i I'm the CEO of coinbase in 2012 we launched the most popular retail exchange where people buy and sell digital currency in 2015 we launched the most popular institutional exchange for digital currency in the United States and just one month ago we launched our third business token so today I'm going to tell you about what token is why it's important and how all of us can help bring financial services to those 2.5 billion people so let's get started with what token is at the heart of it token is really simple it's a messaging app but it has money baked ",
        "2": "into it it has a few unique properties number one those payments work in every country of the world from day one number two it's not just people that you're paying I can force it's also an app platform where we've made it dramatically easier to build digital currency applications I'll tell you more about that in a second number three everybody is in control of their own money on this platform instead of a centralized institution and number four there's a reputation system built into token somewhat analogous to a FICO score in the United States so you know who and what applications you can trust token is a little bit like a browser or a client but it's really speaking all of these protocols underneath and many of them on a decentralized network so for messaging we're using the signal protocol to end-to-end encrypt all the messages so that nobody can read them except you ",
        "3": "this is the same protocol used by whatsapp with hundreds of millions of daily active users for money we're using the etherium network to send money and value over at a centralized global network the applications are using web 3j s and a protocol that we created called sofa which stands for simple open financial application in the identity layer and hopefully in the future the reputation layer will be built on top of you port we launched the Developer Preview of token about one month ago and we have about 10,000 people signed up and using it this is some of the things that people are saying already so in summary what is token it's Global Payments over chat it has an app platform baked in you're always in control of your own money you know who you can trust and it's speaking a bunch of underlying protocols underneath to tie all this together into something ",
        "4": "that's easy to use so the bottom line is that digital currency just got a whole lot easier to use for many people in the world why does this matter so the first reason this matters is that digital currency right now is having its Netscape moment and what do I mean by that when the internet first started it was a collection of low-level decentralized protocols like tcp/ip and people needed to get access to the internet so they ISPs or Internet service providers got created but it wasn't until high level languages like HTML and JavaScript got created along with the web browser that led to the explosion of innovation and new applications being built on the Internet and this is exactly where digital currency is today I want to take a minute to emphasize just how important it is the difference between trying to ",
        "5": "build applications on a very low level protocol like tcp/ip or Bitcoin scripts versus building them on a high level language like HTML javascript or in our case here sofa and solidity so I'll give you a specific example my Kern built an application in the Bitcoin world and Mike Hearn is a excellent developer he's very experienced it took him about eight months to get a basic version of this app working it's called lighthouse this is an app that got built on top of token and it got built by somebody in the community to do something similar the entire thing took about eight hours that's really several orders of magnitude difference and what that means is that if it's that that much easier to build these applications we're going to see several orders of magnitude more applications being created now how many of you have you ever used the app we chat all right well this is an atypical ",
        "6": "crowd a lot of you a lot of you have most people the United States have never heard of WeChat but it actually has almost a billion people using it every single day in China and you know I'll tell you a story I was in Beijing last year and I got on the subway it was really crowded and like the doors closed everyone around me took out their cell phone and I looked to my left my right in front every single person was on WeChat people's entire life and really it's coming it's becoming a bank replacement in China people use it to get a loan to get insurance to order and pay for everything in their life the WeChat only works in one country we with token we're going to build a WeChat for the other 180 countries of the world plus it does a few things even better than we chat number one cross-border payments anywhere in the world and it has great privacy the government's not able to read your messages or have any ",
        "7": "control of your money by putting a bank in the pocket of every person like Ronald out there in the world we're going to be able to bring financial services to everyone the smartphone is the secret to getting these services to everybody in the world and the McKinsey Global Institute estimates that bringing financial services to mobile phones could add three point seven trillion dollars to the GDP of emerging economies so why is token important in summary the first is that digital currency is having its Netscape moment it just got dramatically easier to build applications with digital currency secondly we know that this platform already works because we chat has a billion active users in China we're going to do the same thing in the other 100k to 180 countries of the world and finally when we put a bank in every ",
        "8": "pocket in the developing world we can add 3.7 trillion dollars to the economies of these emerging countries so now what what can we all do to help this change happen faster in the world the first step is easy just search for token browser and any of the app stores and download it and install it next we need your help to build out some of the foundational applications on this new platform and so we are hosting a hackathon it's open to everybody in the world and we're giving away $25,000 in aetherium prizes we have a couple judges joey crude from augur Fredersen from coinbase my old co-founder and wanda name you can go see a video online about just how easy it is to build one of these applications this video which I'm not going to show now so shows in 60 seconds you can clone the template github repository boot it up on your computer ",
        "9": "and within a few seconds your phone will be talking to your application that you just boot it up and we also support adapts using web 3jf so really any decentralized app that you might be using through meta mask or mists also works on token these are just a few of the apps that I think are going to get built on this platform and I'd love to see some of these during the hackathon itself people are going to need a way to get their local currency into and out of aetherium people are going to want to get loans sell their goods send money to different countries earn a living basically the entire financial system 1.0 we want to get the building blocks of it built in this new decentralized finance 2.0 so if you're a developer or you're interested just go to this URL token browser comm slash hackathon and you can register it's starting on June 3rd finally the last steps easy share ",
        "10": "token with your friends especially anybody in the developing world we would love to get their feedback and I'm going to be taking a trip to Nigeria later this year to go talk to customers and work with entrepreneurs in in Nigeria to build out some of these initial apps so it's easy install the app register for the hackathon and please share it with your friends at the beginning of this talk I introduced you to Ronald and I mentioned that there's 2.5 billion people in the world just like him who have access to a cell phone but they don't have access to financial services touken is going to focus initially on the developing world because that's where people have the highest pain point they don't have access to any financial services at all but the truth is that people all over the world want and deserve access to better financial services and so once we've gained a foothold in developing countries I think ",
        "11": "this technology is going to add to the entire world so I see a future where we're all sitting here in ten years and the majority of the world is now running on an open financial system thank you [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have time is like EPA [Applause] all right we have about eight minutes I'd love to answer any questions you have about token if anyone's brave enough to speak up any plans to go to Venezuela yes I mean we would love to go anywhere in the world where they're having a currency crisis I think that's where people having the most pain points right now around digital currency all ",
        "12": "right I'd love to talk about that yeah yeah will we be using ERC 20 tokens so right now token only uses the names get a little confusing there's too many tokens but right now we're only using aetherium underneath there's an open question about whether it makes sense to add all all types of ERC 20 tokens to this platform to be used in various ways so we're still debating that internally but the first version is just standard a theory a moment yeah mmm-hmm how will government's react yeah Oh from a tax perspective yeah so there's a couple ways that this could play out I think in the first world or ",
        "13": "the developed world coinbase and G Dax have really made it easy for people to pay their taxes when they're trading digital currencies so for example on coinbase there's a form you can just print out and we're actually I think in the future it'll move to the issuing 1099s and everybody will just plug it into turbo tax in developing countries the answer is a lot less clear and essentially it's not a great answer but the answer is that it's up to each person to individually report obviously I'm not an attorney so I can't give specifics on what what that will mean in each country and when you will have a taxable event but suffice to say there's a lot of open questions there yes in the back so the first was about the security and the second was about government relation ",
        "14": "or regulation was there anything in particular about that or just you want me to speak generally on that yes yes so it sounds like you're asking about the gray area of losing money and how governments will react to it I think it's a great question I think there are a number of countries in the world that are very concerned about the outflow of currency from their economies Argentina China you could go down the list so I ",
        "15": "don't think I'm going to have a perfect answer for you today one thing I can say is that token is being built in a way that we never have control of any customer funds so we are essentially a software company and we're providing this piece of software to people just like mist or any kind of other desktop software that people might run on their computer or their phone and so I don't think I have a great answer for you on that I mean you could it's a similar argument to running a web browser on your computer right if you're if you're using PayPal on your web browser to send money from one country to another the web browser is a piece of desktop software and it has less of a say kind of in how that happened so like many like many challenges and technologies they are entering a territory where the current regulatory environment hasn't contemplated all of the outcomes so it's probably not a great answer but it's all I've got for you yes ",
        "16": "yeah so how could we use the apps that are already built out there in the world yeah so I think well in some sense there's a community of people who are building gaps already and those those will and do work on coin on a token in terms of other applications that are out there in the world you might be thinking of like FinTech companies that people are already aware of to get a loan and things like that I think we would love to work with each of those people and either you know help create those apps ourself in the early days but I think longer term we'll be able to attract people in to build those apps this is a brand new ecosystem and we're going to ",
        "17": "have to build the initial user base around it and the initial apps and then I think later we'll be able to track in outside third parties to invest in it yes so we don't have any plans to monetize token at the moment but the other businesses that we do run our retail exchange and an institutional exchange and so you could imagine how if digital currency develops utility and starts to add value to people's lives all over the world I think our exchange businesses will do quite well with that yes yeah so how do we add new tokens or new assets to G Dax so I would love to say that by enviar we'll have dozens I mean that's the pace ",
        "18": "that we would like to be going but I think our strength is actually in not being the fastest but it's in being the most trusted in the most compliant so we're being very deliberate about how we new add new assets to the platform including from a legal point of view communication with regulators and our bank partners so the process just to answer it in a nutshell is that we have a risk committee that looks at each new asset we document the decision and we make sure to communicate with our regulators and bank partners so that we're going to be here for the long term yes I think I have time for maybe two more after that yes sir thank you I really appreciate that we need people to help just like you to get this into those countries that's excellent okay thank you yes yes ",
        "19": "so how our apps going to be reviewed or how much moderation this is something we thought a lot about and I want token to really be a browser and it's just like any web browser you can type in any URL that you want to and get there now that's a separate question from which ones are going to be featured and I think the way we've come down to it right now is that the ones that are featured that we put front and center are going to be ones that we feel like have the values of the community that we want to build in the early days and have a high degree of usability and and things like that but we also want to keep it open where people can enter the URL if you will of any gap or sofa app out there in the world and it will load because it's a browser it shouldn't be playing judge and jury in that regard all right is there one last question all right well thank you everybody I'm ",
        "20": "looking forward to hearing all your thoughts about how token can bring financial services to the developing world thank you [Applause] [Music] "
