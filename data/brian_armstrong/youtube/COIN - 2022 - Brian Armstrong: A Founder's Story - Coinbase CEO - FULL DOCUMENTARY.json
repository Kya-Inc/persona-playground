        "1": "okay let's get everybody in the place let's get ready to lock up the doors thank you we'll lock it up game here we go from the top reading from the dolly prompter [Music] settle in please let's roll sound and roll cameras [Music] four cameras I'm Brian Armstrong co-founder and CEO of coinbase when coinbase first got started we were a simple place for people to buy and sell Bitcoin the largest U.S cryptocurrency exchange is about to be a public skepticism from Wall Street about Bitcoin coinbase is a company with an ambitious Vision to create more economic freedom for every try that one again coinbase really helped take cryptocurrency from an internet hobby for coders to a mainstream investment today I imagined a world where anybody with a smartphone could have access to sound money and financial services where every payment could be as fast cheap and Global as sending an email we're helping ",
        "2": "make this happen by building the open Financial system for the world that sounded like a question for the world for the World by building the open Financial system for the world [Applause] I grew up in San Jose California the early days of the.com Boom was happening in Silicon Valley [Music] it was kind of a nerdy household right there with the camera what is your name and how are you related to me hey Dave Armstrong I'm your dad my dad was a environmental engineer too late my mom worked at IBM she was one of the early women computer programmers [Music] I was really shy as a kid and I felt like I have these good ideas but people don't listen to me everyone ",
        "3": "this is Brian's room my molecule poster poster and my he come on he was very interested in computers so we shopped around and tried to find a deal on a used one and we finally got him one that was a pretty good working computer but it had a German keyboard so we said here's your computer Brian it's up to you to figure out how to use it in high school I built this website I remember I went to sleep and I woke up in the morning and I checked the stats and like a thousand people looked at it while I was sleeping it's like making a copy of myself talking to these thousand people all over the world I was like the coolest feeling ever when I went to college my roommate and I were trying to think about how to make some extra cash and I realized if we were to tutor high school students yeah we could make great money we decided let's make a web app it was called University tutor and I thought getting customers would be the hard part but the movement of the money was actually the hardest part somebody from ",
        "4": "our bank called us one day they're like what are you guys doing why is this money moving in these certain patterns and you know are you aggregating customer funds and I'm like I don't know what that means and it felt like I was actually being treated like a criminal I was disappointed I couldn't ever get it to break out and be a real success so after I graduated college I ended up selling it I felt like what do I want to do with my life I wanted to put myself out of my comfort zone so I decided to move to Buenos Aires for a year Where Are You Gonna Live Well I don't know there's this panzion or something I'll go see if they have a room there and I mean it's just sort of really loose Freer than I would have been one of the things I did notice living in Argentina is that they have this really amazing culture and people there are really proud but they also have this history of really deep distrust of the government I got to see what a economy ",
        "5": "and a culture looked like that had gone through hyperinflation and didn't have a well-run monetary system I remember these menus I saw at a restaurant prices would update due to inflation frequently enough that they had to put new stickers on top instead of printing new menus one of the things that stuck with me was that they didn't believe that the future could be better I remember feeling kind of frustrated about that it felt like yeah this is just kind of wrong [Music] around Christmas time the 2010 I came back to California and I was home with my family and I happened to come across the Bitcoin white paper [Music] I think it was Christmas dinner and we were saying come on down we've got dinner hot on the table and he was saying just wait just wait it was describing something kind of like the internet that was Global and decentralized that no company or country ",
        "6": "owned but instead of for moving information around like the internet it was removing value around I thought oh my gosh this could have an enormous impact on the world I remember my mother at some point was like you know come down and spend time with the family and I was like I'm reading this really important thing I don't know and talk about it no no no because we wouldn't have understood it if you did after Christmas I got back on the plane I started flying back to Buenos Aires I remember having this sinking feeling in my stomach oh my gosh why am I leaving I'm going the wrong direction the Bitcoin white paper was a major technological breakthrough it actually solved a number of major computer science challenges and it allowed a new thing to exist in the world that people found valuable each time we figured out how to do a new thing on the internet we fundamentally disrupted a major industry email ",
        "7": "disrupted the postal office the World Wide Web disrupted all media and advertising SSL allowed us to do Commerce over the internet one way to conceive of Bitcoin is it's the technology that allows us to move money over the Internet we've had lots of digital monies for a long time but they were regulated by Banks and other big large institutions like a national government Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that takes a very different view where it's decentralized and not in the control of a Central State anyone can access and earn and receive store and send Bitcoin without asking anyone for permission no matter where they are in the world all they need is internet access Bitcoin is providing a form of economic freedom to everybody on Earth that we never had before Bitcoin is given the power to the people and making it more of an even plan ",
        "8": "doesn't matter their background of race ethnicity poor kids black kids Spanish kids whoever you can participate and not have to be from Wall Street modern money as we know it more or less started in the depression in the 1930s and yet it feels to us that the way money is now is the way money has always been that any other way to do money is ridiculous money becomes money when a lot of people believe that it is money right like if I make up Goldstein bucks and only I think it's money it's not money but if 100 people think it's money then it's like kind of money for those hundred people if we all buy and sell stuff with it it's like money a little bit for us if a million people think it's money like it's pretty money-ish now if a hundred million people think it's money it is definitely money Bitcoin today still feels to many people like an uncertain slightly crazy outside of the mainstream idea back up 10 years ago people who thought you absolutely insane ",
        "9": "I came back from Argentina and eventually took a job at Airbnb but you kind of just couldn't stop thinking about Bitcoin I just had this very visceral sense that the economy is becoming more Global but many of countries around the world don't have stable Financial systems and it's deeply unfair I really believed in the potential of Bitcoin to create empowerment for people but it needs to be dramatically easier to use and trusted and safe using Bitcoin at that time was pretty difficult if you wanted to buy some you had to send a wire to one of the only Bitcoin exchanges of that time called Mount gox which was in Japan frankly it was not the most trustworthy Place authorities in Tokyo arrested the former head of the japan-based mailbox or allegedly falsifying Financial records that were 100 million dollars were unaccounted for also by the way if you actually acquire any Bitcoin and your hard drive crashed your Bitcoin would be gone so I felt like the solution is hosted Bitcoin wallet in the evenings and ",
        "10": "weekends I started tinkering with this prototype the big idea was make Bitcoin use reviews just the concept of cryptocurrency what's that you know and how are you going to make a living off of it I'm not sure we still understand it the analogies that I had in my mind were services like Gmail if you lost your phone or your computer your email wasn't all gone it was in the cloud and people were doing security and backups for you remember I was talking to somebody yeah I'm thinking about launching a hosted Bitcoin wallet and this guy was like oh my gosh that's a terrible idea I thought maybe I'm crazy you know I was like I think this is kind of cool and interesting but like nobody else seems to think so let me apply to Y combinator and see what they say Y combinator is a startup incubator meaning it funds a whole bunch of startups at once and then tries to help them get rolling the minute I got accepted into I commentator I decided I was quitting my job at Airbnb and starting this new company how is he going to survive does he have health care what's going to happen here ",
        "11": "does he have enough to eat so unfortunately very few startups succeed we tend to think of the ones that do Google or PayPal these kind of iconic public companies this is why we created statistically the chance of a startup going public is less than a percent for sure I can't wait to tell you more going public is for Founders what winning an Academy Award is for an actor all right I need to pick some name for this thing I'd happen to be reading the Wikipedia entry for the Bitcoin protocol and I saw the word coinbase in there coinbase is okay I didn't love the name but I'll change it later coinbase is a hosted Bitcoin platform you can access your money from any device you don't have to worry about security and backups we'd love to have you bring it we'd love to have you help us bring it to the rest of them I need a for three months you go through this y combinator boot camp and then you go pitch at demo day in front of all these investors coinbase is doing for Bitcoin with iTunes into the MP3 Brian's idea ",
        "12": "was not a hot deal with investors after demo day this was not the one that every investor in the valley was talking about and felt like they had to have a piece of it was really depressing after I graduated from y combinator there was a lot of things that I couldn't figure out how to do and I needed to find a co-founder I kind of grew up on the Internet played way too many video games my parents thought that was a total waste of time Fred was certainly in high school into that in a pretty serious way to the point where in my opinion he was kind of losing sleep and we needed to tell him to kind of go to bed one time to try to get me to stop playing my mom shut off the circuit breaker for the whole house needless to say she was unsuccessful [Music] after college I went to work at Goldman Sachs as a foreign exchange Trader I thought it was the closest I would get to playing a video game for a real reputable job Goldman is an elite institution and the job that he got was ",
        "13": "well into the one percent when I got there I learned this video game wasn't that much fun unfortunately I found Bitcoin on a Blog one night and became obsessed it got to the point where I was trading Bitcoin in the bathroom at work one day I see this post saying I've created this demo app it makes it really easy to use crypto and I'm looking for somebody to work on with here I am thinking yeah it kind of seems like cryptocurrency is small and crazy and feels like a toy right now but um that seems like something I would really want to spend my time working on my cell phone rings and it's Fred and Fred says Dad I think I'm gonna go join this startup and I said okay he decided to turn his back on Lifetime Financial Security sell all his stuff go out to the West Coast or a highly risky venture the office was a glorified apartment it ",
        "14": "looked like a bachelor pact I think there's an old building and as a matter of fact about a year or two after they were in there a piece of the building fell over fell off and hit somebody in the head it was it was seriously outside the building I mean it was an old old building we spent all of our waking hours together six to seven days a week constantly thinking about what can we do to make this better it became clear that Fred had insane work ethic and we had very complimentary skill sets I didn't know for sure if it would work out but there was something special happening at some level it almost didn't even feel like work just because I think we were having so much fun while we were doing it we both did a bunch of coding and Engineering worked on the product and then we both did a lot of customer support late at night it was getting to a place where like our whole day was answering sport tickets and we realized we need to start hiring hmm I really I remember I came into ",
        "15": "their office and I thought I had a good chat with them I remember thinking this guy is really high potential I reached out to him and asked if he would be willing to consider joining coinbase I am just like unfortunately I am kind of busy with this thing but you know the best of luck with your journey I was in Washington state working as a lumberjack but I was paying very close attention to what was happening in the cryptocurrency landscape and I wanted to see this in the world so I just emailed jobs at coinbase and said I'll do anything I knew I didn't have any concrete skills other than I knew a lot about Bitcoin and I was ready to work hard the team felt like a family what's special about a startup right is that everybody is sort of like sick with you and shared vision for the future felt at the time like we're doing something incredible but people would sign up for the product and they would never come back and use it so business wasn't growing and we were on the verge of running out of money we did not have ",
        "16": "product Market fit one of the key attributes of entrepreneurs is being too stupid to know they're going to fail there's really a very few startups that make any sense at the point of startup otherwise that firm would already exist I called up some people who had signed up to use the app and I was like what do you think and they would say well I liked the products but I don't really have any Bitcoin so I didn't have anything to use it for so that kind of made me think well if there was a button to buy Bitcoin in the app so you had some would you use that and they were like maybe yeah we posted online that the feature was live we went to bed the next day a bunch of people used it and the day after even more people used it and the day after even more it goes from pushing a boulder up a hill every day to the boulders rolling downhill and you're chasing it as fast as you can we were being inundated with customer support inquiries the website was periodically going offline we had all kinds of hackers trying to break into the site from 8 PM until 2 A.M was Brian's uninterrupted moment to actually build the website we developed this ",
        "17": "system where interrupt me if it is if it is some kind of emergency but we had to Define emergency I would run up to him with a Post-It note and I would write Red Alert and hold it up for him while he was still working I think it was like the number of digits of money we would lose if this wasn't fixed in the next hour our bank is like calling us every day we're probably going to turn off your bank account if you don't get some more money in your account and at that moment we rushed out to raise the series a series a is where a venture capital firm will place a bold bet on the company saying hey we think this has a chance of being a billion dollar plus company so in late 2012 I got an email from Paul Graham it said hey Fred we're ready to do the series a in coinbase can I introduce you to Brian and Fred we were so burned out and superprived we didn't really have a slide deck or anything and we basically said here's our Revenue graph we're using our working capital to fund this and we're going to run out of money in the next two weeks do you want to invest in the super early days crypto ",
        "18": "company Founders were either scam artists or they were almost like religious zealots I meet Brian and he explains to me I'm a former security engineer at Airbnb I know how to secure crypto assets we'll comply with the regulations and he just seemed pragmatic [Music] all right we're uncapping the champagne ready what are we celebrating we're celebrating uh the fact that earlier this morning we checked our bank account and it happened to have 5 million more dollars in it than it did last night it is accurate [Laughter] we briefly took of adjournment from the monitors in the office to go up to the roof and celebrate yeah kind of popped it and we kind of ",

        "26": "can you can you buy stuff is it investment it seems quite volatile please explain Bitcoin to us well that was a lot so I'll try to start at the beginning uh cryptocurrency is just digital money and that's the simplest way to understand it and people don't need to understand all the technology how it works underneath they're buying crypto because they want to own a little piece of it because they think it might go up in the future and really there's just a ton of potential about how it can evolve in the next 10 years so for that answer start with Bitcoin sorry Start pretty simply with Bitcoin Brian these days when you talk about crypto currencies to laymen how quickly do people's eyes glaze over bending thing when you first read about it that takes people a little while to wrap their head around the short explanation I give to people is I say this is digital money you know instead of for moving information around like the internet this is removing value ",
