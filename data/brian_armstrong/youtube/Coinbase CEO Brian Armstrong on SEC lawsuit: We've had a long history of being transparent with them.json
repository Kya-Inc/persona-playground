        "0": "yesterday the SEC suing crypto Exchange coinbase in New York federal court the agency alleging coinbase was operated as an unregistered exchange and broker join us right now first on cnbc's coinbase's CEO Brian Armstrong good morning to you uh we've been debating this at the table for really the last three hours frankly already but uh we're glad to have you at the table that to to join in on this discussion um help us understand from your perspective when you first saw this lawsuit uh what your reaction was and what and and to the extent that you have a defense and I know you've taken to Twitter but now you can take it to the airwaves uh what it is you know I mean we were disappointed to see this complaint from the SEC because I feel like we've had a long history of being very transparent with them and really every regulator around the world that we've worked with so even going back to 2021 when we became a public company you know before becoming a public company you have to disclose everything about your business in depth there was many back and forth revisions of our S1 and frankly you know they they had every all the knowledge then and they allowed us to become a public company and then we're going through time and you know chair Gensler has ",
        "1": "statements to Congress saying that he doesn't feel he has the authority to regulate this industry and we're seeing conflicting statements from the cfdc and the SEC chair and we even filed a formal petition with the SEC asking them for clarity about a number of points in the law which they never responded to and then this Wells notice and and a complaint arrives and so this isn't good for America it's not good for the industry obviously and we now need to go get clarity from the courts I want to show you uh chair handler was on CNBC yesterday I want to show you a clip and get you to react uh if I could take a look at this in the coinbase uh uh complaint we note that they have through the coinbase wallet you can trade 16 000 different tokens and there's a lot of debate as to the use cases and whether there's any there there look we don't need more uh digital currency we already have digital currency it's called the US dollar it's called the Euro it's called the Yen they're all digital right now we ",
        "2": "already have digital Investments and you you have digital you have entrepreneurs representing digital Investments on this program all day long and it's it's whether it's the big tech companies the automobile companies uh you name it It's All Digital right now the investing world so what is the real underlying value of these tokens and that's why you need full fair and truthful disclosures do you think this is about disclosures or do you think this is about the underlying currencies that are on on your Exchange it's tough to know what exactly what he means by that I mean um our self-custodial wallet is not trading crypto uh the ones that he mentions some huge number that's happening in defy that that's not something that we actually operate the trading out our centralized exchange is really trading a much smaller number of assets we've we've reviewed you know over a thousand assets in crypto we rejected 90 of them because we felt they weren't appropriate ",
        "3": "for our exchange and about 200 of them are listed on our centralized product and I don't know to his to his point about you know what's the there there um people are using crypto for all kinds of things they're not just trading and they're doing payments with it you know Ukraine raised 200 million dollars and presidential candidates are taking it and it's a new technology that can be used to update all kinds of financial services and we don't we don't need the government picking and choosing our technology winners let's let the market decide that when you spoke just earlier about the IPO and the IPO process and the back and forth that you had with the SEC I think implicit within what you were saying was that they approved us as a business and yet the prospectus itself as you know also says very clearly that effectively the SEC has not opined on the underlying business itself and in fact that the company can't actually legally say uh publicly that that the SEC has do you agree with that well they allowed us to become a public ",
        "4": "company understanding the S1 right and so I feel like that's our moment to be totally transparent with them show them everything about our business and how it operates and so it's not great to have a regulator sort of come back later and say actually we changed our mind um Brian that didn't change their mind we had John Stark the former SEC office of Internet enforcement chief for 11 years he was on earlier he said it's very specific that in the IPO the SEC does not bless does not approve these things and it says very specifically they could come back and say that there is additional regulation that's required or additional disclosures or additional filings and I think what they're very specific about is you call yourself an exchange you call yourself a broker dealer when it comes to prime those are things that you need to register for if you're going to be you know either an exchange or a broker dealer just like the NASDAQ or the NYSE would have to well so a couple points one is that if you're trading Commodities you know that doesn't necessarily apply right we have actually gone out there and acquired a broker dealer license because we wanted ",
        "5": "the ability to trade crypto Securities there's actually I think there could be a big robust Market of crypto Securities trading in the US even though we don't list any Securities today um and by the way I think you're right the regulator does have the right to come you know edit their thinking at times and come back and say you know here's a new set of rules and great we'll be happy to follow those the issue in this case is that we're getting conflicting statements from The cftc Head and the SEC head and then the statements from the SEC are are so you know out such an outlier they're saying everything other than Bitcoin is a security well that's not our interpretation of the law that's not what the law says and so and that's not what the position of every other country around the world their financial Regulators is taking and so I don't think we really had a choice honestly we had to go to court to really see if this otherwise this industry is just not going to exist in the United States warning there could be additional regulation is one thing but but you know bringing enforcement action on something you knew full well at the time was was occurring that I don't see how how all ",
        "6": "of a sudden you make that that leap that just seems arbitrary and capricious and vindictive almost that is a regulation by enforcement approach and you know we met with the SEC 30 times in the last year they never gave us a single piece of feedback about what we could be doing better we just got silence and when we asked them how would you like us to register you know we have this dormant broker-door license could we activate that we got we really got silence and so it's not appropriate for the regulator to come back and and do an enforcement action if we don't have a clear rule book and clear guidance "
