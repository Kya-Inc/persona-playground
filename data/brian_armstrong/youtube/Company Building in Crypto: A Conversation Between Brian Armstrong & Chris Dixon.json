        "0": "[Music] great welcome it's great crowd um thanks Brian thanks for being here yeah all right we're gonna have a hopefully a kind of a fun casual talk about about crypto and coinbase and so maybe um maybe if you don't mind good look we go back to how you started started coinbase sure so let's see I studied computer science and economics in school and I was always even younger than that I was always trying to start things like when I was a kid on the playground in elementary school I tried to sell candy to kids and you know I was always trying to start these various projects but in school I studied computer science and economics and I was really interested in how software was gonna disrupt these ",
        "1": "different industries out there you know healthcare and education and finance was one of those so fast forward a few years after college I tried to start up which you know didn't really go very well it was in the tutoring space and I moved to Buenos Aires Argentina because I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life and that was a country that had gone through hyperinflation right so that was the first time I got to see a country that it experienced that it really just changed the entire culture of the country like I remember being in a restaurant and seeing a menu and they had these prices on the menu with stickers stacked on top of stickers and like basically the prices were changing so quickly I didn't want to print off a new menu every week right and so you know fast-forward a few more years I decided to move back to Silicon Valley I wanted to think about you know working in a startup that was doing really well so I could learn how to do it and so I joined Airbnb which I think I was employed 40 at that time and it had grown really quickly it was you know growing to 600 people and they were moving money all over the world to 190 ",
        "2": "countries and I got ahead sort of a front row seat you know as a software engineer there I had a front row seat into how broken the global financial system was because it was like high fees and and each country we were trying to move money into and out of had these kind of opaque broken infrastructure like a little old agape of different payment companies there and so broad to yeah hi fraud so you know 2010 I was home for Christmas visiting my parents and I happened to read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper for Bitcoin and I think I just saw it on hacker news one day and I remember my mom was like you should come down and spend time with the family and I was like I'm reading papers on the internet you know this is really exciting I remember having this thought actually that like this is the most exciting thing I've read in like five years and I think the reason it sort of captured my attention and I didn't even really understand it at first when I read the Bitcoin white paper it was really complicated I had to reread it like three or four times and the coming ",
        "3": "months but something about it captured my imagination because I remember thinking you know the internet was such a transformative thing in society it's this global decentralized protocol for moving information around but here was another protocol that was also global and decentralized but it was removing value around or money and I remember thinking wow this could be as big as the internet and you know I wasn't really old enough to start a start one of the formative Internet companies because I I was still in school but I was like whoa maybe if this is gonna be as big as the Internet I'll be there at the beginning and I could start one of the formative companies so you know for the next year I just kind of couldn't get it out of my head I started going to Bitcoin meetups in San Francisco and I remember thinking actually in 2011 like maybe I'm too late to this industry because there was already some exchanges in San Francisco like Tradehill and Mount Cox it was in Japan so anyway long long story short I ended up I was still at Airbnb I started ",
        "4": "working out on a prototype that would eventually become coinbase on nights and weekends and I applied to Y Combinator they wrote me a check and I was like all right maybe I'm not crazy because all my friends thought it was like the stupidest thing ever and so they gave me the check and I went to go try it out it's awesome yeah Marc Marc Andreessen tells a story where he I think you moved out in 93 for Netscape and he was absolutely correct that before Netscape and he was absolutely convinced that he had missed like the computer revolution that like it was just I mean thinking back now 93 it was right before you know obviously the 90s and the whole internet thing and apparently the time cd-roms was like the hot thing in the valley yeah sounds kind of funny today was like you know encyclopedias and things like this so yeah you think a lot about this like these technology trends you know VR is it you said no winter is it gonna when is the time where it's gonna have its iPhone moment so it's really hard to time these technology trends but I don't know if you might have yeah no I mean I one of the things I feel like I've learned over the years is the things that I don't know me and my friends or ",
        "5": "whatever people like you think are gonna happen I feel like most of them have happened like I started a machine-learning company in 2008 which turned out to be probably too early but I think we were in the end we were right we were just wrong on the timing I mean which by the way as a star that means you're wrong you're you know it you're really wrong but but so you know but but it often the the sort of these vid so I mean I IV I'm sort of a innovation maximalist like I think VR is actually about to come back there's actually exciting thing tomorrow for those are into VR you know obviously crypto is I mean to me it feels like the you know like you like you know you only get a few of these big things in your career and for me this is clearly kind of a new computing paradigm and a and a you know a chance to really kind of make your mark yeah and I the timings hard to predict who knows like it might take longer and people who know about the stuff know there's issues and UX and scalability and all these other things but yeah I remember I think I like your concept of nerd energy it's like look ",
        "6": "what the engineers are doing in their free time and I think you were the one that told me that you know Stanford has this elective computer science class and they're like you know the number one class is AI and the number two is crypto now internal ected for computer science so it does feel like the engineers in the world are really excited about crypto that's a good new indicator of where things are going well I kind of think of it as like there's not that many like when you go to work 9:00 to 5:00 you're working for a business manager who generally you know in most companies has a one to two year horizon right and and so how many how many contexts are there where people can really work on things that are far farther away right and so government and academia you could to academia things like this like government-funded projects academia and then the other one like how do people in Silicon Valley kind of how do engineers kind of vote so to speak on the things they think are cool it's the nights and weekends right so I think there's a deep reason why you know the homebrew Computer Club like all these kind of great things in the history of Technology did start in garages and you know clubs and sought you know the the Bitcoin meetups you ",
        "7": "went to were in many ways the kind of the this decades homebrew Computer Club right yeah instead of hacking on computers they were hacking on money yeah totally I mean I think we'll see I mean but you think so yeah so okay so great so then so you started the company you know I think you know we invested when in 2013 a kind of one of the I don't know it was it wasn't really the first kind of I don't you know upswing of Bitcoin but that was one of the bigger ones that kind of got more attention and then there was kind of what we call the winter you know what I guess what can you talk about that period and kind of lessons learned yeah well crypto keeps going through these big run ups that are you know enormous and then it corrects back like 50 or 60 percent and then it'll do another one each time it's at a new plateau and it's been really kind of stressful to manage a company during those periods you know and I think you invested during that series B was one of those run up periods where we were just feeling totally understaffed we didn't have enough working capital to service all these ",
        "8": "people who wanted to buy crypto and you know that's obviously a good time to raise cuz like you know it looks like things are on the up-and-up and you go out there and you try to raise when there's a lot of interest now of course that's also when usually everything is on fire in the company and like you know there's a huge backlog of customer support or you don't have enough people or whatever so it's been interesting to manage through those cycles it's also been interesting just to manage kind of you know our own my own psychology as a CEO like and a founder and then the team's psychology as an extension of that because you know you always have this pressure sometimes as a CEO where you're like you know you can step back and say okay this is this part isn't going well this part is going well what do I think the long-term potential is but then you know in the next minute you have to hop on the phone call and like sell a candidate and why they should join and so there's sometimes you feel like you know put on a like a really positive face right and so in the there was a crypto winter which I guess was like you know late 2014-2015 where it ",
        "9": "was interesting a lot of people the price had come down normally there wasn't really that much exciting happening in the space I think you know we had probably 25% turnover that year and I was kind of like week after week getting in front of the company like hey this is this is gonna be a long game like the fundamentals are there it doesn't really matter what the price is we had a lot of people who had joined kind of at the peak and they had just seen the price go down for 18 months two years they're friends and it's like the friends and family thing is a tough one like you go home for Thanksgiving and like oh you're working on Bitcoin like your time said that was a scam or whatever you know and so the family test like people want to be you know they want to feel good in their peer group about what they're working on I think that's an important lesson about entrepreneurship generally actually is that everybody I've ever talked to who said you know I'm gonna start this company and I'm just gonna do this for a couple years to kind of make some money before I go do my next thing which is like the real thing in the kind of in the back of my head I'm always like you're already done you just don't know it because like the first two or three ",
        "10": "years of any startup is just setback after setback and nothing we're works and within three years that thing that was hot won't be hot anymore and so the people who I see that actually make companies successful it's like they have this they're passionate about it for some other reason than just building a company and they're willing they're they've already kind of mentally signed up like this is gonna take 10 plus years and usually after 2 or 3 years you just been like setback after setback by the five-year mark you're starting to see some signs of success and by 10 years it's like it's actually working so we're corn base is about six years in now and you know like clockwork kind of right around the five-year mark we started to really see signs of success but I think we're really like 1% of the way on this journey yeah so then let's suppose maybe before then and so then you know what what happened and I mean so there's obviously things like a theory em and this kind of proliferation of new kind of you know networks and tokens and things like this where ever ",
        "11": "do you think we are now yeah so I remember for a long time you know when coinbase started and for a long time after that it was Bitcoin only right so we were Bitcoin only and I was under the my mental model for this was like tcp/ip got invented you know yeah there's some other protocols that are out there but like the vast majority of the the network is gonna run on this one protocol Bitcoin and I think you know 95% of the investor activity and entrepreneur activity was in that one protocol and of course then this kind of scaling debate happened about you know how he's big playing in a scale and these factions emerged in Bitcoin which I was very surprised by and my initial reaction was like all right let me jump in there and try to help steer the industry towards something that would create a global scalable payment system because you know my minds my motivation for starting point base and and our mission was to create an open financial system for the world I just I thought like that would create more freedom and innovation and all these good things and I saw a Bitcoin sort of turning into like digital gold it wasn't gonna work ",
        "12": "as a global payment system because it wasn't scaling so I you know I flew to China to meet a bunch of the miners I went to some conferences and met a lot of the core developers and I really kind of put out like a statement like hey I think we should move in this direction and it turned out I hope I kind of totally overestimated my ability to influence the you know people weren't using logic they were using emotions or tribalism or something and you know it didn't didn't go in that direction so I remember there was a moment where it flipped in my mind and I was like oh wow like we can't we can't just be a Bitcoin company because Bitcoin may not be the thing that creates the global payment network it might just stay as digital gold and I remember actually the moment where I woke up I was at this conference and the next morning I woke up and I was like oh man bitcoins not gonna get there and so I kind of went back to San Francisco and told the team like alright we're gonna add more currencies we're now a multi currency platform we started with aetherium we now have five on there and then we're gonna add a whole bunch more but I think you know now I think of it ",
        "13": "as a slightly different mental model so it's not tcp/ip that's one protocol to rule them all there's gonna be a couple of these you know like Visa MasterCard Discover or gif jpg PNG if you want to use an internet analogy and in a way that's good because it means there's multiple competing standards and you kind of de-risk any one of them becoming like this slow incumbent in a way it's bad though because it means that people who are new to cryptocurrency they have to try to wrap their head around something that's more complicated if everybody's getting into crypto is like you know you only see it in Star Trek and Star Wars they're like how many galactic credits do you get or whatever so if it was everybody just used one system that would kind of be simpler but I guess it's not gonna be that and so now we have this heterogeneous system was all this Cambrian explosion of new tokens and ideas and protocols which is really amazing but it's so it's de-risked it but it means it's a little bit more complex and on approach you could imagine a you know the one of the beautiful things about software is the ",
        "14": "way you can architect so many different interesting things so for example you could imagine a system where the end user deals with what's called a stable coin or whatever bitcoin or something else has a single thing to deal with and then maybe behind the scenes these networks are you know are interacting using different tokens and maybe it's you know moving across multiple networks and each one is they're trading tokens behind the scenes or something like that right so you could imagine like the ability to abstract away some of that complexity for the end so let's still maybe get the benefits of it yeah and that's been one of our goals certain that coin basis I always tell the team our strategy is to be be the most trusted like secure and compliant and then build the products that are easiest to use and so that that definitely falls into the easy-to-use category is like this technology is really powerful it has all this potential to help the world you know how can we actually make it simple enough for the average person to get benefit out of it and those kind of ideas you know like just abstracting away underneath can be really powerful like you know a great example is on a website you go visit it maybe it's sending ",
        "15": "JavaScript and CSS and HTML all over the wire but it doesn't really matter to the user they're just seeing one thing yeah I mean one thing we should say in case it gets on the internet that I'm I'm a big I think you'll say the same thing I'm still a huge fan of Bitcoin I have a Satoshi white paper on my wall in my office we ever come to my office yeah so for people on the internet yeah yeah so we are pro Bitcoin Twitter don't blow up my Twitter so know that said yeah I'm changed the world i but that's it I want to I want to talk about why aetherium is so cool right which is yeah so and by the way I I by the way I consider it I think you probably have seen I consider ourselves like a crypto maximalist or innovation Maximus we are like all these things and we hold a lot of these things and so just just to be clear like we're not you know yeah but I'm agnostic yeah but but but but but the thing about a theorem so like Bitcoin does have a scripting language but it's deliberately made to ",
        "16": "be kind of limited because for security reasons which is you know the trade-off they decide to make a theory em is sort of take the opposite attack which is to have an incredible script like you know Turing complete is kind of the you know computer science lingo language that's relatively easy ten lines of code like and and that led to for example the ICO thing which was really like those literally it was one of their examples on their homepage was how to do crowdfunding and so it's just very it's relatively easy to get going and that and that I think at least in my mind of what you think kind of helped kickstart the 2015 16 17 kind of Renaissance of crypto I totally agree yeah I mean that was a fundamental innovation on top of Bitcoin was a more sophisticated coding language which allowed these smart contracts and all these tokens and everything to get created which has all kinds of implications we could talk about you know what's cool is is all these new it's really the Cambrian explosion of ideas there's you know privacy coins ZK snarks there's people ",
        "17": "creating you know next generations of top of aetherium things that are even more scalable so it's exciting to see the amout of innovations in space yes if you look at all the protocols we use in the internet today they're all what 30 40 years old there's been almost no protocol development I'm something it struck me was remember when there was the SSL heartbleed bug I think it was two years ago yeah it came out in that process that it turns out there was like a half a developer who maintained SSL which is just insane like it was like literally like some person part time right so think about SSL some SSL you know is the encryption everything on the internet that's encrypted oh my god like all the banking like all your privacy everything and it's it happened and that's because I've been no money and there's no business model for protocol so the only business model was government funding right back when tcp/ip all these things were you know DARPA funded all this stuff and Google Google charity from the ad word you know money pretty yeah and so they'll give so now now I think after that happened like Google and companies kicked in some money to SSL and things but but one of the things going on now right it's just like it's this golden age of protocol development so aetherium itself is you know has all this ",
        "18": "expressiveness and excited people but then it inspired all these haven't you know like wanna file coin or whatever just like all these other people say hey maybe there's a business model for protocols and that was something no one's thought about for 40 years or some things um and you know and a lot of academics now gotten excited about it and so just like that level of I don't know for me it's hard not to to get excited about all of that you know like fundamental computer sound like dan Binet who works with us who's at Stanford and you know he feels like look it's just like unlocked to like half of you know a whole new field for him essentially yeah that's true I remember you know studying computer science and being a software engineer there was I don't think I'd ever met anybody who'd actually created a protocol yeah until crypto you know there was there's like some esoteric fields of computer science or people who do like compilers and operating systems but I'd never met anybody who'd created an actual protocol and it wasn't till the Bitcoin protocol I remember I really tried to dig into it when building the early version of of coinbase and I was like wow this is something totally different and new and like learning all this binary codes they were encrypting ",
        "19": "in there and everything well if you did distributed systems to be the closest thing prior to blockchain stuff just the core assumption was you control or you or someone you trust controls all the computers right and so all the algorithms are all based on that premise it's like they're sitting in Google's data center and you're trying to like sync up your database or whatever right and so this is like now let's now what if you take away that assumption like there's a whole new kind of design space unlocked which is just also you know just really cool from like an intellectual academic point of view so anyway so let's talk about now so so now you know you've any employees you have now a little four 500 and so you've been going through this kind of rapid growth phase and have been you know kind of really you know hiring a lot of senior management and kind of taking the company to kind of a more you know kind of just sort of the next stage is I guess the company's development or something you talked about sort of some of the things you've been thinking about or learn from that or like lessons learned or yeah well you know at every stage of the ",
        "20": "company something totally different has to happen right so initially you're in this room with ten people and you kind of know what everybody's doing and you're just working on a product and answering support emails and then you know you get 250 and you start to like not you know you need some layers of management and you get to 100 and anyway I mean our most recent one we went from kind of like 150 to 500 and I remember you know some things change so one thing is there's this you know Dunbar number I think it's called it with 150 people so once you cross that number you stop being able to really remember everybody is and some people in the office you walk by and you don't actually know their name for the first time so that's pretty interesting and then communication starts to be a challenge too because in a in a group where you know everybody you can kind of just you know pass the word down and you know whatever he's doing you can hold it all in your head and when you cross that threshold you know now we're at 500 I don't actually know what every team every single person every team is doing I don't necessarily know their name and so there's a challenge in leadership which is like how do you get everybody moving in the same direction and so ",
        "21": "that's where things like you know values your mission your vision statement coming you know having communication channels to pass things through through through the company and say okay here's our q4 okay ours we're gonna do this All Hands meeting I'm gonna make a communication the leadership team they're gonna tell all the first line managers and the second line managers that hey we need to have this thing done and so that's the skill set that I've been learning you know actually I'm a big fan of executive coaching that's something I advise a lot of entrepreneurs to do in CEOs is learning on the job I think it's been really helpful for me to work with people who have previously been CEOs you know I have a board which is a really great as an advisory function but I actually like to hire somebody to come in and like work with me on various projects - I mean one of the things is like just because you happen to start a company and you know maybe found product market fit doesn't mean you necessarily know how to run a product meeting or how to just all this sort of blocking and tackling kind of basic so there's nothing wrong with that right I don't know Sal OTT with especially ",
        "22": "with kind of injured entrepreneurs who used to be engineers I'm by the way a huge fan of executive coaching and like we do it ourselves like we recommend it to every I think just a fantastic thing if you can if you have means to do it because you learn about you know you learn your own your weaknesses you kind of get your 360 kind of feedback yeah and and and but why but also why would you know this stuff right like I mean a lot of the stuff right I mean yes if your background was mostly engineering he worked at Airbnb but like you know you yeah it's just a ton of stuff to learn there's nothing wrong with learning that you haven't getting help learning that so so what so okay so so ever you think I was gonna say I mean for me I think a lot of people let the founders they like the early stage just want to focus on product and that's fine and then they they sort of move on to their next thing or hire a professional CEO or whatever for me I actually want to be a CEO run a run a business have it be enormous like I'd like to run a public company someday so for me it was very important to go train and learn those things and you're very you're very ",
        "23": "deliberate about it like you do a lot of coaching a lot of MCAT advice like I mean yeah you sort of very much you're very into kind of personal and professional development is all right that's right and actually one thing the board you know we do 360 reviews you've probably written a bunch for me but you always said he always sends NPS feedback after every board meeting what can we do better in the board every time you don't have to Brian you get like how can I do but it's great yeah we have we have a good like two-way feedback culture I tell the employees that too I was like the board gives me feedback too you know so that's let's talk a little more about so crypto so perhaps people in the audience some of them maybe you're into some aren't the ones that aren't a question I get a lot is you know what is this useful for beyond speculation right I mean so for a lot of the frankly you know use cases have been kind of more speculative that's clearly not why we're involved like what are the what are the end-user applications to get you excited yeah that's right I mean a lot of the the early ways that people get into crypto is often to try to make money or invest but I think the potential of it is much bigger than that and that's ",
        "24": "that's what we focus on a lot is trying to shift it to these utility cases so my three kind of current favorite use cases that I look I'm looking to are number one it's emerging markets right so there's a lot of people out there who don't have access to any financial system whatsoever and but they do have a cell phone now that's actually describes about you know between one to two billion people in the world who have a cell phone but no access to financial services at all and so I'm really excited about that in fact you know I started a charity that's making a small direct cash payments to people in places like Venezuela with crypto which we can talk about it's actually it's also technically it's a very good use case because one of the features of crypto is that the recipient can verify they got the money using just math and not having to ask a third party which is our existing payment some works you ask a bank and those billion people it's roughly a billion they can get $15 Android phone now that will come down you'll be able to get a $3 phone it'll probably be like Benedict Evans who works with us comes up he does all these studies on this it'll be there'll be ",

        "26": "building new versions of those apps where every upload or like button is money being transferred so you know you could imagine a version of Reddit that people it's global and every up vote is money being transferred and so there's people actually getting paid to like answer these questions or submit great content and it's kind of interesting like if you imagine the internet got reinvented but now it has a native currency that's inherently global what would people do with that and you've talked about this you're very articulated on it just saying the business model the Internet is like since there's such a steep curve to get someone to put in their credit card you know you basically just collect all this data on the on the customers they're the product they're not the customer then you sell the exhaust of their data to advertisers and that's kind of been the default business model but if you can actually move money around as easily as you can sending an email then a lot of new business models get created yeah and I think of it as you know what the internet sent a lot of wonderful things one to me one place has fallen short is and figuring out a good ",
