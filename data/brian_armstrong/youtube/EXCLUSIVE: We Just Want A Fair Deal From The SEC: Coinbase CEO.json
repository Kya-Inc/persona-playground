        "0": "i think a lot of folks who are listening to this hear about regulation they feel that there is uh some tension between the companies in the space and regulators both in the united states and also internationally as well i want to use kind of the tangible example of the lend product that you all um had you know kind of ideated on you wanted to create and launch uh there is this now infamous twitter thread that you put together and put out publicly kind of calling attention to the fact that you didn't think you were gonna be able to launch it and maybe just walk us through kind of how uh this process works and you know both i think from uh if you can what you think coinbase is kind of doing to to move towards a uh a solution but also maybe from the regulator's standpoint are there things that you think like yes they're doing this and that's actually a good thing uh it's a fair thing to be doing and if there's anything that they're doing that uh that you think could be improved or changed yeah sure so the lend product was kind of um an interesting example for us by the way the the lend product is not really material to our revenue at this point or anything like that but it's um it's an interesting case because ",
        "1": "some of our you know competitors great companies and crypto by the way um have had a product like that out in the market for a couple of years we've we've seen demand from our own customers to have it and so we decided that we wanted to go out and put out a similar product um what was frustrating is that we proactively went to the to the sec ahead of time we've been telling them about our development of this product and um we felt like we had buy in there but as it approached our launch date we suddenly saw a much different stance from them and they came out and said we well you can't not only do we have concerns do not launch this and if you do we'll we'll be suing you and they sent us a wells notice which is kind of like a preliminary document before you sue somebody so the product never launched but i was kind of frustrated by that because i felt like well the goal of the sec is to protect consumers and then create a level playing field so you know number one um how are they protecting consumers in this case i think a lot of consumers demonstrably ",
        "2": "have wanted to earn higher yields on their on their savings accounts and things like that they're not really getting those products from the existing financial services so that was one open question and then the second one was how are they creating level playing field because it seems like other companies are have been able to do this but coinbase suddenly is not allowed to sometimes we're we're a more well-known company we're a bigger company and so we sort of get this scrutiny that other startups don't have by the way i kind of understand that the sec is just one organization they don't have time to look at every startup but they kind of can look at the big ones um so we were stuck in this kind of uncomfortable position where the sec would not tell us why they didn't why they thought it wasn't shouldn't be allowed they were very close-lipped about that i'm not sure why maybe they didn't want to tip their hand in some kind of litigation or something but it just didn't feel collaborative or uh being upfront at all um and they and they were creating the sun level playing field in the process so at the end of the day we sort of talked to our lawyers about it and they felt like what's what is our case here like should we go you know we're being ",
        "3": "harmed should we should we proactively sue the sec should we uh just enter litigation with them and try to create some kind of legal precedent but we felt like there's a lot of deference given to um regulators in the court system and we we have frankly no desire to be engaged in drawn out litigation with any regulator right i consider that to be very much a last resort we always want to be proactive and collaborative with people and so we decided not to launch the product essentially we're going to wait and see what the sec does in terms of the other products that are out there already in the market um where it's it's not a level playing field today um i think we want to also just focus our efforts on maybe even more important things happening in crypto like the questions around which of these tokens are securities and how is defy going to be used um there's you know these are the things that i guess we really want to stand behind and sort of say these are the benefits to the crypto community that we want to go make sure there's a good legal precedent for um but i you know i when i went to dc i reached out to the sec i tried to ",
        "4": "get a meeting with them um they told me that they weren't meeting with any crypto companies i was kind of surprised by that um because there are so many different regulators out there every single one has been willing to meet with us and every other branch of government by the way and scc was really the only regulator that i was not able to get a meeting with as a new the first crypto public company in the united states that they weren't willing to meet with me when i went to dc so there's something kind of strange going on there i wish that we would basically all just be able to pick up the phone and talk about this stuff it doesn't need to be in a combative stance and whenever i see something like that happening that i think is kind of inauthentic and you know i i i tend to talk about it publicly i want to put this stuff out in the in the ether so that the world can know about it and they can make up their own mind about um how these things should play out in government so i want to ask uh kind of a couple of different perspectives from this specific situation because i think it's a good tangible example uh where people can understand uh both your perspective and also the regulators uh ",
        "5": "as a publicly traded ceo uh especially one that it just came into public markets if you went and you talked to somebody in the legacy finance world they would say oh my god that is nuts to do a public thread and talk about the sec et cetera how do you think about uh risk reward in terms of having the conversation and kind of pushing forward to what i think you know based from what i understand you've said publicly and also uh elsewhere is um you know really trying to work towards the solution like how do you view that uh moving towards the solution and did you evaluate any sort of risk with kind of being more public maybe so than than other people would yeah so i mean look there's no right answer here okay so i'm not going to come out and say that it's the right thing to do or it's the wrong thing to do a lot of this stuff comes down to kind of gut at the end of the day and um the way i thought about it was um you know first of all twitter twitter is a funny thing because if i had gone on to um cnbc or something like that and said the same thing people would have probably thought like oh that was a healthy debate or dialogue there's something about twitter which um you know ",
        "6": "people it's a very much like a west coast and east coast thing right so on the east coast the the reaction to my tweet i'd say was more negative people were like wow how could he do that um you know he should be going through appropriate channels and you know wall street journal or or whatever and people on the west coast were like that was the best thing i've seen you know all year and they were like finally somebody's willing to just speak the truth about what's going on behind the scenes and put it out there in the open right um and so i think there's just a cultural difference that's happening look my my i'm not naturally a combative person i'm actually like kind of conflict avoidant right like i my default is to go build genuine relationships with people just try to work on stuff like even if we disagree there's there's a way to make it win win and just move forward but if somebody is you know if they're not going to meet with us to even have a conversation which by the way i still my my optimistic view is that we can change that um we still haven't gotten a meeting with the sec for someone you know high up there or gender to talk to me personally but my hope is that that's still on the table ",
        "7": "um and if i can't get that then eventually i'm just going to go out and talk about it publicly so that people can know about it i think it's a form of accountability frankly um and that's like the way that the this is trending in the future it's it's going to be companies are less going to be going through traditional channels cnbc um you know wall street journal mainstream media new york times they're going to be bypassing that and going direct to their community via modern tools you know blogs podcasts like this one twitter and you know youtube and all the modern tools that are out there so it's just it's an interesting cultural moment where west coast companies i think are starting to take a different view on this than the east coast and when you look at it from the regulator perspective it almost feels like one like you said there's so much stuff going on uh i definitely do not envy being a regulator right now in terms of trying to figure out uh not only you know what is uh inbounds or out of bounds but also just like what to go focus on first i went through the exercise recently and said to myself you know if you're a regulator ",
        "8": "and you stack rank all the different things going on in this industry like what do you even go look at first it's hard to just do that exercise alone and so are there areas where you think that uh and crypto companies a lot of folks who run other companies or investors in the industry can kind of meet in the middle like like what is that middle ground where you think you're like okay this is the activities that we should go focus on that can actually push this forward get to solutions on some of these issues and ultimately i think find some balance between the uh kind of economic empowerment the innovation the job creation all the things that we know to be positive but also satisfy whatever the the concerns are of whether it's regulators politicians etc yeah so i totally agree by the way i have a lot of empathy for regulators in this space because they have a very hard job it's so new it's changing so quickly um you know frankly i would have a very hard time getting out there and sort of publishing clear guidance on it i think it's i think it's very difficult but coinbase has been thinking about you know what we can do to help here in fact when i was in dc one of the most common ",
        "9": "things people asked me was can you help draft something you and your lawyers helped draft something that would be proposal a proposal about how this industry could be regulated more efficiently right so that coinbase doesn't have to have 50 plus regulators in just one country um and then and we don't have this kind of jump ball between the different federal agencies so actually we've been working on a draft proposal uh a regulatory framework for the industry we're gonna be publishing that probably in the next two weeks or so and it's meant to say not that we have all the answers but it's it's a start to the conversation and i think it could make sense to have um one agency or basically uh you know a division within one of the existing agencies be the the single point of regulation a single federal regulator in the united states um that can help this this industry get a little bit of clarity so that this industry can be built in the united states effectively and the us can kind of maintain its position um as a financial hub and a leader in technology with with appropriate regulation in ",
        "10": "place so i think we basically all want to think the same thing we want to help the industry grow but have some reasonable regulation that's thoughtful and i guess we want to try to be part of the solution here not not just engaging in you know um antagonism and so we're going to put out a proposal there and i hope people are willing to come talk to us about it what's up guys bang bang thanks so much for watching the best business show today if we're going to be the best business show we obviously need the best partner that's why the exclusive sponsor the best business show is sofi they're an all-in-one platform that allows you to invest in all kinds of different assets including stocks etfs crypto ipos and they even have an automated investing function if that's your thing so before we start getting after it again make sure that you go download sofi you get an invest account and when you make your first crypto trade regardless of what you buy they'll give you ten dollars in bitcoin for free it's that simple head on over to sofi.com to get started today thanks so much for watching and i hope you come back and watch more the best business show tomorrow ",
