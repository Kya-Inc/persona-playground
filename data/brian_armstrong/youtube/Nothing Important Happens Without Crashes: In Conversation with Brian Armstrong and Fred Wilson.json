        "1": "society and what happens within that and some of the pain that is inherent in that process and there's something i wanted to read to get us started off she wrote this just a week ago i'm just going to read the couple gra a couple of first graphs of a blog post she wrote and we'll kind of launch on from there so she says innovation as schumpeter held is the driver of growth and marketing economics economies okay but although technical change is constant it is not strictly continuous once or twice in each century the whole economic system is deeply transformed by a technological revolution that changes the patterns of production and consumption and i think you guys can start to see something familiar here right the early decades are characterized by a ruthless process of unfettered free markets and creative destruction while the new paradigm is learned major financial bubbles and their collapse announced as in the 1930s and now the need for the social shaping social ",
        "2": "social shaping of the new potential and i think that's where we are now you look at this industry bitcoin crypto digital currencies digital securities all these different there's a lot of potential there somehow that is going to connect with the wider society the question is where does that stand right now how does that happen and how does that progress and as the ceo of a large company in this industry and as a early investor in this industry i would think you gentlemen have some insights on that great open-ended question yeah so i mean carlo perez i think is spot on in that analysis and actually fred wilson is the one who introduced me to that concept uh back in the day so um i do think we're going through that cycle that's exactly what's happening in cryptocurrency um one thing i would maybe disagree with her on is that it's not i don't think it's any longer one or two a century hopefully we're getting more like one a decade at this point um because i think technology just ",
        "3": "continues to accelerate in the world and that's generally a good thing so to your point um it starts off in this kind of free market this primordial soup and you see this cambrian explosion of ideas you know look look at all the people in the room all the companies being funded in this space we've never seen more good teams out there building cool stuff and venture money flowing into this space so it does feel like we're in that kind of to me the free market phase of it where there's just tons of amazing ideas happening now at some point i think this is actually pretty far in the future um the space you know may start to reach a size where it starts to have a really big you know social impact as you as you said uh like let's say that more than 50 of all people are primarily doing their banking and financial services in cryptocurrency that's we're not there yet that could be 10 years away or something like that um but once we get there i think you're right companies like coinbase will have a big responsibility and a lot of scrutiny in the world like that um my you know i think one of the ",
        "4": "important things to realize though is that the beautiful thing about cryptocurrency is that it's kind of like the internet it's decentralized nobody owns it um nobody really controls it so you know that's a really great check and balance on companies in the spaces in the space because if coinbase does something you don't like or our fees are too high or whatever the issue is you can you have choice and your switching cost is very low you can always take your cryptocurrency off and go to another provider so in that sense i think it'll always be a free market when switching costs are low and that's going to be great for everybody consumers businesses all of society you know last year on this stage bology um said something that i thought a lot about over the past year and he said you know anybody can make a crypto anybody can make a currency in their dorm room right and and i was we were just waiting to come up here on stage and we were hanging out with a guy who's literally made his ",
        "5": "own currency so that people can buy a stake in his book that he's going to self-publish right and you just think about that it's like and he thanks you for that free promotion that you just came here of course but my point is like that is kind of flipping the publishing model on its head and saying every single person oh and the way it's going to work by the way is if you buy the book on amazon you take the email receipt and you send it to him and he'll send you the token and then you have a stake in the book right so the book and the coin is all the same thing it's like i don't know if it'll work but it's such a provocative different way of thinking about things and it's possible because anybody can make a currency in their dorm room that's the fundamental thing just flips money on its head yeah that's why while we were talking about what's that guy's name no we're gonna we're gonna wait we're gonna keep this in stealth and he's gonna come out later september look for it uh yeah it's funny because i was ",
        "6": "thinking the same thing i mean it is a really good example early right like you said you don't know if it'll work but it is a really good example of one piece of the potential of this kind of technology and if it works for him that becomes something very positive for him the the flip side of that of course is what does that mean for the the industries that are already existing and they make their business selling books and they've been going through a lot of convulsions in my industry media has been going through a lot of convulsions over the last few decades as the internet you talk about technology is coming every you know 10 years or so but the truth is right we still want to read stories right we still want to watch films we still want to listen to music we still want to see beautiful art so that will never change but what does change is the ways that those things get financed the way that those things come to market the way that we might participate in those systems and we got i feel like halfway there with ",
        "7": "the internet the internet changed the way that that could get delivered to us but what mark andreessen said was what they when they wrote the spec for the internet they forgot about money right and what cryptocurrencies do i think is give us money in internet form decentralized like the way everything else works on the internet so now we can i think go the rest of the way in truly rethinking the entire supply chain right not just how it gets delivered but also how um the creator gets rewarded and how the the consumer pays for it and and everything else yeah you know i want to turn this cheaper brian and ask you a slightly pressing question right it is interesting right we're talking about reinventing money and what it can do that's all great and fine and you've built a business over the last seven plus years now um you've made a couple of moves lately that have been very interesting we're not here to just promote what coinbase ",
        "8": "is doing but you've made a couple of movies here lately that are very interesting and it was funny because yesterday i ran into somebody here and they said are you going to talk about coinbase right and i said yeah yeah and they said well you know they're just a bank now and my question to you is the moves you have made have obviously been with an eye towards growing your business towards making more profitable creating something that's longer and lasting and and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that but if you end up just replicating what already exists in other words if coinbase does just become a bank with a digital skin on it have you created anything different and i think that's what we're talking about that's what carlotta perez is talking about things are changing what are they going to look like in the future are we going to create new things or are we just going to reiterate what we had which wasn't working anymore and we all saw that in 2008 so i mean what are you building at coinbase what are you becoming yeah so i think that's a fair question um what you know the regulators of course would say we're ",
        "9": "absolutely not a bank we don't have a banking license all that stuff but i understand what people mean when they say that which is that we're holding people's money and we're kind of um we're centralizing it in a way because a lot of people have come and used coinbase um so in that way you know we're almost like a victim of our success or something like there's a little bit too much power or something in one place so the way i think about that is is a few things one it's the switching cost that i talked about earlier right um people should always be able to exit which is which is not true by the way for like the traditional financial system in the sense that um you know visa or something like that like the only way to use the visa network is through one company visa so you don't have like this option or this choice um the other thing i'll say is that we're very much a believer in the idea of having people control their own keys as well i think for a segment of the population today that's going to be very important and what it could actually be a much bigger portion of the world in the future if we can get the usability improved so with coinbase wallet we've ",
        "10": "built a product that people can control their own keys a lot of the really cutting-edge stuff that's happening in crypto people are accessing through coinbase wallet um you know one of these so it's basically this balance of like how do we get a billion people in the world using crypto well it needs to be very usable and secure but how do we make sure it doesn't get too centralized in one place so i think we're basically offering something for both and we'll have to see how it evolves from there yeah yeah and it's funny too i know a lot of people everyone knows that crypto twitter is so tribal right a lot of people are going to take that and dunk on coinbase don't coinbase bank but that really is a question that i think everybody in this industry needs to ask themselves you know it's i keep it's really funny i keep thinking of the saw guerrero line in the trailer for rogue one that didn't make it into the movie that should have made it into the movie i think that movie was better than force awakens but maybe that's a question for another conference um where he says you know if you continue to fight what will you become what will this industry become what are you fighting against what are you trying ",
        "11": "to build and are you going to build something different and better and i think even 10 years into bitcoin's development that is an extremely pressing question and i think in the last couple of years to be honest i think some people in this industry have lost sight of that and i wonder what both of you guys think about that where is this industry going what do you build it will it be better than what exists well i can i can offer a thought on that so this is true of all technology revolutions that you know carlo perez talked about right um when you know television first came out it was like this grainy image and black and white and the audio barely worked and you know people were saying well i'm why would i use that i can get all the information through radio or whatever right same thing with electric cars right the early things look like toys and um that's what we're seeing with crypto right so you know what you do what you typically see in these markets is um certain niche areas adopt it and then it eventually becomes more and more mainstream and in crypto i think of the most ",
        "12": "mainstream thing you can think of is like swiping your credit card at starbucks or something right and that'll probably be the last area that gets disrupted by crypto but the areas that will get that are being disrupted first are kind of on the far end too far ends of the spectrum one of them is in emerging markets where people are under banked or unbanked and they have no access to financial services at all but they do have smartphones we're seeing that in venezuela and areas like that already which i can talk about and then the other area on the other end of the spectrum are the power users of money um people like developers who need to send you know ten dollars of crypto to a thousand people all over the world in the next minute um or it's people who are sending like really high amounts like a million dollars into this investment in the next minute so crypto is good at these things you know very small amounts very large amounts cross-border payments real-time payments and we're seeing those niche areas get adopted first but eventually i think it'll eat its way more and more into the mainstream because starbucks doesn't want to pay 2.2 uh on ",
        "13": "every transaction and there's no reason why that needs to be the case anymore yeah i mean it's also still the case that a lot of people don't really even know how to get into crypto i i was in la earlier this year and went to dinner with a friend and she said to me i'd like to buy some bitcoin how do i buy bitcoin i said well you go to coinbase.com you open up account you connect your bank account you buy some bitcoin but you know i mean it's like you know we sitting here in this room we're all thinking how does somebody not know how to buy bitcoin but i think if you just walked down sixth avenue and you stopped a hundred people and you say that say to them do you know how to buy bitcoin i bet you like ninety percent of them don't know how to buy bitcoin i was gonna say five five might know how to do it five out of a hundred five out of five i was thinking ten yeah right so it it's still very very hard for people to get into this right i think once you're in it you know then it's a little easier to operate inside of it but we just don't have enough people ",
        "14": "there and there's a whole bunch of things that have to get solved i think um before we can um really make cryptocurrencies feel um mass mainstream uh transaction times and you know getting people comfortable with security issues i think being able to store your assets safely at a place like coinbase that can do something like cold storage at scale is absolutely necessary people don't want to put it on like a little hardware wallet that they then somehow keep you know somewhere like that's just not going to ever be a mainstream solution so that's why i think it's taken time yeah you know it's interesting something i've thought for a long time is i think excuse me there are two ways to look at this one is within the industry and then one is how the industry is going to fit in the wider world but within the industry you know we see these and boom you know these bow and bare phases but boom a bust we had it and ",
        "15": "everyone knows we're not going to go through the history of you know but what i think is really interesting is we look at the price and we think the price is telling us where the entire industry is at this moment but i think there are several dynamics going on within the industry and they're not happening at the same pace i think the hype cycle got way ahead of the development cycle and the adoption cycle and it sort of raised expectations to a point that the rest of it wasn't really there development is you know i mean look at the bitcoin core is is it even at version one point something yet isn't it still at like 0.10 or i mean you are still developing the software adoption like you said i mean 10 5 10 people on the street might know how to do this how do you guys you know navigate through all the different dynamics within the industry and then let's talk about how this connects to the wider world well first i would say i have a friend who said to me nothing good happens without a rational exuberance meaning nothing good happens without a bubble to finance ",
        "16": "it if you really think about what happened in 2017 billions and billions of dollars maybe tens of billions maybe i don't even know came into the sector a lot of that is still in the sector and now being deployed against developing new protocols developing scalability solutions developing lots of other things and so we will see the benefits of that of that financial investment that got secured by the industry in 17 start to reveal itself over the next 12 to 18 months that's the thing i'm most excited about you know in our portfolio we've got about a half a dozen projects that are going to go live in the next six months and i'm really excited to see how those go i think some will do great some will do terrible some will do okay that's the way it is in my business those are all crypto related yeah yeah yeah all crypto related projects and so um even at coinbase ",
        "17": "brian i mean you you you like three extra five extra 10x the the the engineering investment in our infrastructure in the past 18 months right yeah i mean in 2018 we grew 2.6 x so um i mean we have just a variety of products now we we try to think of it as like you know 70 2010 in the sense of 70 of our business is really just exchange and helping people get their first bit of crypto onboarding all these people into the crypto economy that fred talked about 20 of our investment is kind of in these adjacent bets like we're building out um a custodian for institutions which is helping a whole bunch of money flow into the space there and then 10 of what we do is kind of more of our venture bets internally so um you know we're building out coinbase commerce um coinbase wallet we launched a stablecoin usdc so um yeah we're very much trying to help this industry just grow in a whole bunch of different directions here's a cool thing they built you can now store your crypto assets ",
        "18": "securely at coinbase in a in a cold storage system and participate in in staking those assets in a proof of stake network without exposing those assets to any sorts of vulnerability and that's the kind of thing it's just gonna have to be that way right people aren't gonna just accept that someone can come and steal their assets if they're gonna stake them right so that's core infrastructure that had to get built and coinbase built that in the last 18 months yeah yeah i mean you talk about custody obviously is such a big issue and it is on one level it seems kind of just a logistical technical issue but obviously it's big um finance everyone knows just had a hack and lost not a huge amount of money but the fact that a large exchange like that could get hacked they are commonplace they always happen where do you see you know where do you see this the state of this ",
        "19": "industry right now in terms of that in terms of the fact that you still can have an extremely large exchange get hacked what has to happen to make people more comfortable yeah i mean it still feels like we're in the early days to me um i you know there's a lot of really amazing companies in the space that are all trying to build secure solutions and um you know we certainly we wouldn't throw any stones you know like everybody you know we have people trying to break into coinbase all the time and you know so it's something that we have to be very vigilant about i'd say from the early days um we invested a lot in this and just talked we thought a lot about how can we get the majority of these funds um off the internet uh store them in cold storage but still provide some of the features that fred wilson mentioned like staking to our customers there was a lot of innovation that happened there um you know we're in a world today where we're on generation four of our cold storage uh we kind of rebuild it every 18 months or so um we're in a place where we have these you know data centers actually all over ",
        "20": "the world that are geographically distributed and you need a consensus of key holders to come together to restore any of these funds offline we hire you know third-party firms to come try to break into it and they they come pose as uh candidates applying to work at coinbase uh the team you know typically only the head of security and me know that it's a drill um but the person will come in and apply for a job and have a week in the office and try to break into our systems and you know see if we can um still be redundant against attacks like that have any of them done it i mean in every security uh pen test that we've done um they'll give you a report card at the end like these are weaknesses these are these are benefits um and it's always there's lots of layers of security right so they might breach one or two but hopefully not get the whole ball game right so um those are kinds of things that we do all the time and um you know knock on wood we've i think we're the only major exchange that hasn't had a breach um so that's really good but um doesn't mean we can't continue to be ",
        "21": "vigilant yeah i think trading and custody are different things doesn't mean that the same company can't do them obviously coinbase does them but i think the market needs to understand that you might choose to go trade a pair you know on a small exchange in asia because they offer it and nobody else does it doesn't mean you want to store the asset there you might want to go transact there but it doesn't mean you want to store it there and you might want to do your staking and your voting in a third place coinbase is going to offer that too but as brian said the thing that's cool about this technology is that people can vote with their feet they can custody in one place trade in another place stake in another place i think coinbase is going to make a solution that makes people kind of want to do all those at coinbase but you don't have to and i think the important thing that ",
        "22": "that people need to understand is that those are different things and you can't you can't trust an exchange to securely store your assets unless they have a reputation for being a safe and trusted place to do that a lot of the losses that have happened in this industry over the last 10 years have happened because people made the mistake of thinking that they were putting their assets somewhere that was safe when they weren't going back to mount gox right yeah one thing we're looking at too is um you talked about self-custody earlier i mean i would love to be in a world where people could actually self-custody say through coinbase wallet and still participate in exchanges right i think i think technologically that's going to be possible um we're talking with people like starkware about that and um i think that's a good place to get to as well yeah you know i mean i also would like to self-custody some amount of crypto on my phone right but i don't want to necessarily have a lot of my crypto on my phone but there's some reasons why i ",
        "23": "might want to have some here just you know to have it at the edge as opposed to in the center of the network and i think what we will see in the next i think relatively you know near term is systems that allow people to be able to have all of that kind of sync together into one kind of storage system where the assets are where they need to be and optimized um like the way like a way sweep account works you know in a big bank or something you know think about that for crypto assets um you and i were on the stage last year uh and a year ago at this conference there was a lot of talk about the institutional money and it was right around the corner and it's just gonna come yeah and now here we are a year later and we're still talking about the institutional money and it's right around the corner and it's just going to come let's just talk about that for a minute the state of crypto the the the ties that are being formed between the crypto industry and ",
        "24": "traditional finance institutional money where do you guys see that right now where do you expect that relationship to go yeah well i think we have good news to report on that um and now largely that has played out uh i would say yeah so like for coinbase custody for instance you know we launched the product about 12 months ago um we just crossed a billion dollars aum for institutions there's about 70 institutions who've signed up um adding about 150 million you know au a month so to a large degree that's been a success and uh you know there's more and more features in there that we can continue to add they want to do otc trading they want to do staking they want to be voting and doing the governance on chain so actually fred and i just attended event last night where we met with a bunch of institutional clients and i think that space will keep growing really rapidly you know bitcoin is still the most important brand out there in the world that a lot of them get get interested in and that's why they come to crypto but i think once they're they have their ",
        "25": "bitcoin position they start to think about how can we get additional alpha and you know a crypto first or a crypto forward company like coinbase you know we now have 30 assets available for for institutions in coinbase custody and some of these advanced features like staking so they're actually coming there because they want a whole variety of things out there in the crypto ecosystem well so the huge thing about institutions is that when people read in the wall street journal that institutions are coming to crypto what they think is uh blackrock's coming to crypto goldman's coming to crypto but actually that's not what has happened what has happened is that there are maybe a hundred token funds what do we think is that about the right number yeah it was probably 200 or so but some of them are in asia yeah right so if you go around the world maybe 100 in the us maybe another 100 in asia maybe there may be more than that right and collectively you know those 200 token funds probably ",

        "28": "um so that's that's largely been the case today one other data point i'll throw out there about institutions um i think now on coinbase pro 60 of our trading volume is from institutions so i agree exactly what fred wilson said um people were thinking goldman black blackrock and i think they'll get there but the institutions that are coming on today are some they look a little bit different but it's really slowly becoming more and more of all i mean every institution is going to have a crypto part of their business in in the next few years if they don't already yeah so we have we're under two minutes um do you guys want to give me just quickly uh you know one or two big things that you are thinking or looking at or you know what are your major thoughts for the next hour because six months let's throw it out there i'll go first i think we will see crypto networks form around core compute infrastructure and i'm thinking storage i'm thinking compute i'm thinking bandwidth i think we are going to start to see large-scale crypto networks form to ",
