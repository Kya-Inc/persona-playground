        "2": "one this is an interview i've been trying to get for such a long time it's brian armstrong and he recently tweeted out that he wanted to do more interviews so i reached out to brian and we agreed to do this but it was clear at the very start there needs to be no questions off limits and he was game it was really important to have that because i didn't want to do the interview and people thinking i softballed him i wanted him to know that look we need to do the tough questions and i also think it's worth explaining my approach to the interview in advance when i posted that the interview was coming on twitter there were a lot of people dropping me comments and sliding into my dms with the questions they wanted asking and telling me that i had to go hard at brian and i certainly wanted to ask the big questions but no productive interview is constructed on a platform of hostility and it's rare for brian to do such an interview so i wanted to create a bridge to ask these tough questions whilst maintaining an open dialogue and listen coinbase isn't going away it will likely remain one of the biggest bitcoin companies and on-ramps therefore having this dialogue with brian is helpful and hopefully influential for me it's ",
        "3": "helpful to understand the nature of their relationships with regulators and government agencies and also to be able to put across key issues that bitcoiners have and discuss these in a long form interview now people can just fight coinbase and they can just push the hashtag deletecoinbase on twitter and shout insults of brian but as i said coinbase is not going away and if an interview like this leads to coinbase funding open source development allowing greater scrutiny on their decisions and push back in areas such as privacy then i feel it has been productive also no we had just under two hours booked in for this and we ran out of time if there are questions i didn't ask that you hoped i would then i'm sorry i actually had six pages of questions and points and i just prioritized what i felt like i really needed to cover so the history of coinbase what happened with s2x privacy coinbase analytics and also what happened with neutrino i will also be pushing for a follow-up interview because i do want to get through some of the ",
        "4": "other subjects i didn't have time for and also to follow up on some of the things we discussed i do want to thank brian for doing this interview and being candid with me whilst i may not agree with him on everything and i don't want to give too much away about what we discussed i think this was progress i also recognize that some people won't like this interview i expect they made that decision before listening to it anyway and some people say i didn't push hard enough and others will think maybe i did a good job this is the spectrum of responses that you end up dealing with when you're trying to tackle an interview like this and the complex subjects around bitcoin anyway i'm happy to take feedback always happy to take feedback if you have any questions you have any points you can reach out to me my email address says hello at whatbitcoindid.com also just want to shout out thanks to a few people who helped me prepare for this interview lee quinn matt odell and janine i really appreciate the time you all gave me to help me discuss and prepare around a few of the subjects that i discussed with brian anyway i hope you enjoyed the interview have a great weekend and i will see you soon brian how you doing doing great thanks ",
        "5": "for having me on the podcast and uh great to finally meet you as well and you as well um so i was saying to you that i didn't know if i'd ever get this interview i've prided myself on getting everyone i got zabo on i went out to japan and interviewed car palace i never thought i'd get this one but i've always wanted it and it kind of felt like you didn't do a lot of podcast interviews so firstly thank you for agreeing to do this and how come you decided to do this because you obviously know there's going to be some tough questions coming yeah i know that's totally fine and you know the first thing people should probably know about me is that i'm a bit of an introvert so that might sound strange as uh the ceo of a company but i've never really loved doing a ton of external facing stuff but what i've done over the years is i've tried to find a way to make it work for me so you know over the years of coinbase i did some kind of traditional media interviews some of those were okay but they oftentimes you end up kind of you know doing an interview and you get like one or two lines quoted or something in an article that's otherwise not really the message you want to get out there in the world so i kind of really appreciate the this sort of new ",
        "6": "form of media that's happening and i just decided a few months ago i was like you know what i want to go to a bunch of podcasts and like more youtube and like kind of the channels where you know our young our audience is and our customer base is now listening to those things so you were one of the people that got recommended to me on twitter and i've been listening to your stuff over the years by the way as well so i'm happy i know that your your audience probably is mixed in their views and everything like that but i think that just makes it a better discussion so happy to do it great well there is a lot of pressure on this interview there'll be a lot of people watching there's been pressure on me that i ask the right questions in the right way and and there's pressure there'll be pressure on your answers and there'll be a lot of eyeballs on this and one of the things i did going into this and preparing is i'm i'm not one of the most hardcore bitcoiners out there quite a few of them have me blocked as well i i i don't tweet out delete coinbase and i i you know one of the things i i'm a queen i was a coinbase customer very early on i've bought a lot of bitcoin with ",
        "7": "coinbase it has the best user experience out there obviously for transparency kraken is a sponsor now and i use them but i'm historically a fan of coinbase and the company's not gonna go away it's a huge company one of the biggest in bitcoin but there is this kind of gap between you coinbase and let's say more of the influential bitcoiners in the community and i felt like if we could start this conversation we can have this you know it may be one interview maybe it'll be two but we can start building that that kind of relationship and and start addressing some of the issues and you know i can put some questions to you you can put the responses back you know people will maybe understand so many decisions maybe there'll be some compromises maybe there'd be some concessions but i felt like this would be a good platform to start that conversation for sure yeah i'm happy to do it you know i've always been happy to engage with people over the years and i think it's one of those kind of things about the internet right which is that it's really easy to be you know question someone's motives or ",
        "8": "think they're kind of a jerk you read their stuff online and then usually you meet them in person you're like okay they're just like a reasonable person so it's actually i'll tell you it's almost i can't think of a single time anybody's ever in person been kind of like mean to me or rude to me i think it's the vast majority of people out there in the world they recognize that you know we have the same ideals but there's different ways to get there and you got to try to build a company and the company is trying to have one foot in the regulated world and one fit in the crypto world and so most people are very reasonable and they understand that but there's a small intransigent minority on twitter who gets their voices amplified yeah i know i've met some people who've given me a hard time on twitter in person and usually it starts with an apology oh sorry i was so rude and that's why you know i think these uh i agree with you these kind of long form interviews are a lot better format for working through things and also like if whatever people think of coinbase firstly congratulations you've built a multi-billion dollar business i mean that must come with a lot of pressure ",
        "9": "must have been a lot of hard work one of the things i noticed in preparation like i put out actually can i tell you something funny yeah you know i put out the the banner of the interview sorry the banner on one of the interview like i let people know you're coming i saw that yeah yeah so i spelt your name wrong in it and nobody noticed okay felt terrible but but what i noticed there was a lot of feedback a lot of questions and then i went through your twitter and almost every time you tweet it's just full of negative responses and i guess one of the starting points is i wanted to ask you does that get to you um yes it does get to me although i think every year it gets to me a little bit less so and and i don't think this is unique to me i i i probably get more than the average person but the if you look at almost every account on twitter it has all kinds of kind of negativity happening i think that's just an issue that twitter's trying to work through and make sure that it doesn't become like a bullying platform right like you ",
        "10": "know reddit for instance the replies have upvotes so i and hacker news and stack overflow and things like that so the comment threads can hopefully be sorted by some kind of wisdom of the crowd but that's not true on on twitter today so i try not to get too bent out of shape about the comments i will say you know a couple of interesting anecdotes about that like one is that um nobody really told me when you when i went out to start a company they're like you know a lot of people are going to hate you for it or irritated you or something like that and i remember that always came as a surprise and this is kind of like the beauty of a company but it's also has this negative side effect which is that you know there is a decision maker whether it's me or somebody down in the organization and so things get resolved like if fifty percent of people people think it should go one way fifty percent should the other way someone in the company will make a decision and it'll move forward and so sometimes your job as ceo is like well who do i wanna disappoint you know the least today but in other forums like in our government or ",
        "11": "something there's checks and balances and different three three-party system right so if there's massive disagreement it's actually in gridlock just indefinitely and that's kind of a feature because you don't want to have you know a dictator take over the country or something but in a company there's multiple companies competing and so it actually you do have forward progress even if people don't agree so it's kind of if if you're not having some people disagree with visions you're actually not doing the job as ceo and that was kind of a difficult thing for me to process over time was like okay that's just the world i live in like some people are going to be unhappy with me and the decisions that i make i'll tell you one other funny story which is like uh you know so coinbase we all obviously we we have a lot of connections into the person and we try to make it easier for people to get fiat currency into crypto and we also have a lot of connections into the crypto ecosystem we go talk with all the asset issuers and everything and i remember there was one early bitcoin meetup that i went to and during the day i had i put on like not not a suit and tie but ",
        "12": "just like i dressed up a little bit to kind of go to this bank meeting because we were trying to you know get our account limits raised or something so they would let us more people buy crypto and i remember at the meeting with the banks they kind of gave me a hard time and they were like well why are you doing all this crazy crypto stuff and is it safe and what's your compliance program and then i went to a bitcoin meetup that night and i was wearing kind of the same outfit and some of the like really kind of og you know crypto anarchists were coming up to me and like why are you dressed like a banker you know you even talk like a banker and and so i was kind of getting a little bit of from both of them and i felt like you know that's fine i guess we're kind of right in the middle where we need to be if we're building this bridge between the two ecosystems i guess i'm going to expect to get a little bit of heat from both sides but like i said most people they understand what we're doing like if we want bitcoin to succeed we need to get all the fiat money in the world to move over into bitcoin and that's going to require us to have some companies like coinbase yeah so we'll start digging into a lot of that and you know this is a bitcoin show you know ",
        "13": "this is primarily a bitcoin show i don't really talk about all coins but i don't really feel a need to to even address the altcoin v bitcoin thing it doesn't bother me too much that's not you know my sponsor has all coins i'm just not interested in too much myself but so that's not really an area i'm really going to go into but i definitely think we'll cover a lot of the regulatory stuff but i've got a few like leading questions as well i want to get into so you obviously recognize there's this gap between yourselves and the kind of influential bitcoiners and over some of the decisions maybe you've made maybe it's misunderstanding but do you have a desire to bridge that gap do you have a desire to kind of rebuild those relationships and have a closer relationship with some of the more influential bitcoiners well let's see i mean my general philosophy in life is like just yes be kind to everybody and try to see what you can learn from them like even if you disagree right so i would say as a general rule ",
        "14": "yes i'm interested in having positive relationships with everybody of course you know the job is busy right so there's a finite amount of time every day and i got to think about how to allocate that so if i feel like a conversation is you know not moving forward or something i might try to have somebody on the team go do that we have a whole team by the way who does nothing but interface with the community out there and so i try to think about how to balance where can i add the most value and i want to always kind of make those trade-offs appropriately yeah what is your day like like what is a normal brian armstrong day like yeah well so over the years i've tried to change the things that i'm focused on you know in the early days of coinbase i was building the actual product itself i was writing code and then you know it evolved over time okay let me think about how to run a leadership team or even what you know hire a leadership team and i'd say the three things that i focus on now um number one is hiring in top talent so if there's executives that we need to get hired or board members i try to focus on that the second one is around product ",
        "15": "strategy so i love product i think about that a lot and there's usually like five or six things in any given quarter that i care a lot about and i want to attend those product meetings and try to help shape uh where they're going and then the third one is i try to just think about creating a great culture at the company and um being kind of a voice or a direction about how we're all going to act how are we going to hire people things like that so i kind of break up my week like on mondays we have our executive meeting we usually do some deep dive discussions into like difficult decisions we need to make you know tuesday and um wednesday i'll often like interview candidates try to recruit candidates thursday i'll do a bunch of product meetings we also do a weekly q a in front of the whole company so we try to answer any questions that people have submitted and you know friday i'll probably do a mix of things like try to learn try to read try to interview a few more candidates things like that so interface with the board stuff like that so those are all how my my week ",
        "16": "typically is divided up and then you know it's a full-time job so there's usually some stuff on the weekend too a few calls here and there yeah what's it like been doing all this during this kind of weird covert lockdown period have you guys adapted to that yeah so i always like to what is the silver lining in any kind of difficult situation i always try to think about that and with covid obviously really difficult situation for the world but for us i i realized okay if we're forced to all go do this experiment where we work from home we work we work remotely how can we turn that into an advantage and so what i did was i wrote up some of my thinking on that and published it and we talked about coinbase as a remote first company and what that means is that even if some of us are eventually able to return to the offices and of course you're going to have to be socially distanced in the office our offices probably only be able to get 40 50 capacity um anyway but once we have a few people back in the office we all need to keep operating as if we're remote so that there's no advantage to being in ",
        "17": "the office or out of the office and i think what it's going to do is actually be a huge advantage for us because we're able to hire now people from many different areas you no longer have to be within computing distance of one of our offices in the world we can get people all over the world and there's some drawbacks too i mean it's a little bit more difficult to get that spontaneous creativity um that happens when you walk by someone at lunch table or keeping everybody aligned towards like what is the mission what are what our goals this quarter you know you have to really invest in that stuff and just the relationship building too like the friendships that happen at work we're working on how ways to recreate that in a remote first environment so i don't mean to say that it's all better but i think on net it's going to actually be a big advantage for us it feels like it's going to be a big shift change for san francisco itself as a tech hub yeah i would agree i've i've already seen some reports in the changes in the geography of the city the change in rents the change in property prices it feels like it whilst uh the ",
        "18": "innovation is led in silicon valley it feels like it will also be the first place to really push this kind of remote working and huge a huge change for the city right yeah i think that's right it's the rents were getting a little crazy in sf and there wasn't more housing being built and so it was getting more and more difficult for people to kind of earn a living wage and actually live within commuting distance of offices in major major cities in general but sf was probably the worst in the us in that regard so i think you're right a lot of the employees we've talked to um they're thinking about moving out more permanently either it's more rural areas or just other lower cost cities so i think it'll be sort of an evening out like probably rents and wages and really the most dense metro areas will kind of come down a bit and the rest of the areas will come up a bit so it'll be interesting all right man well listen let's get into the bitcoin stuff and i want to do a bit of history with you because i haven't heard it myself you know i've got to know other people very well uh charlie lee especially i was hanging out with with him in hong ",
        "19": "kong and he was telling me about all the early meetups and such but it it'd be great to hear from you actually because i was only recently i found out actually that you worked at airbnb right yeah that's right were you were you a coder yeah i was a software engineer there do you still write production code not a coinbase no i haven't written any production code in a while but once in a while we do a hackathon and i try to see if i can still code something so can you tell me about that journey then from airbnb to discovering bitcoin to starting coinbase it'd be great to hear that from you yeah sure so um actually the story happens i'll start a little bit earlier than airbnb um which is that i studied computer science and economics in college and so i was always interested in the intersection of both of those and um i also did something after college which was a little bit unique which is i went to go live in buenos aires argentina for about a year and i did that just to kind of work on a startup idea and sort of have some adventure and try living in another country that was the first time i had seen ",
        "20": "you know a hyperinflation country that had gone through that and that was something unique to me at least and then i eventually did end up working at airbnb as you mentioned and a couple things there that i noticed one was that they were trying to move money to 190 countries both collecting payments from customers and paying out payments to the hosts the people listing their homes on airbnb and it was a massive headache and we were working on a lot of those issues at airbnb while i was there some of the issues we ran into right was fraud issues so people were putting in all kinds of like stolen payments very high fees and slow payments globally so we were trying to think about i remember one time we were trying to think about this integrate with this payment provider in uruguay and we read all their documentation and it was like we could not figure out if we put a hundred dollars into this thing how much money was going to come out the other side for the host who had listed their home and we called them on the phone we realized they didn't know either you know the rates were crazy high like exchange rates they might have been stealing from us like who knows ",
        "21": "and we eventually just had to send some money through and ask somebody on the other side like how much money showed up because the company doing the payment transfers itself couldn't even tell us so i had this like visceral sense that the global financial system is actually a patchwork quilt of these like local proprietary systems and it's a huge barrier to innovation that's happening you know companies like only the biggest companies like airbnb and uber at great expense were able to kind of invest in expanding country by country by country and of course the easiest countries to expand into from a financial services point of view are the most developed countries right so the countries that maybe need this kind of income and economic development the most are the last on the list to integrate because you know it's very difficult to find any legal way to integrate with a local payment system in zimbabwe for instance so from that lens you know i then read the bitcoin white paper this was in i think december of 2010 and um i was just at home for christmas ",
        "22": "it might have been thanksgiving i think at my parents house in the bay area in san jose and i just uh read the bitcoin white paper i saw it on hacker news and i remember reading it and thinking this might be the most important thing i've read in like five years you know and i didn't fully understand it the first time i read it but i had i was like this sounds kind of like the internet and you know the internet i always felt like was this huge deal where i wish i had been born maybe you know five or ten years earlier so i could have kind of tried to create one of the early internet companies or something and i was like whoa maybe this is like the next internet that's going to happen so over the coming months i re-read the paper a couple times tried to wrap my head around it i was like you know how what are all the ways that this could not work or how did it could fail and eventually i started going to some of the early bitcoin meetups in san francisco as well and that was like a really unique experience this is all while i was at airbnb this was um you know trade hill if you remember them and they had they were hosting some of ",
        "23": "the early bitcoin meetups in san francisco in the mission district and it was a really funny kind of motley crew of people you know some of the people there were like these kind of computer science phd people and some of them were like just completely crazy people too who were there and sometimes you couldn't really tell the difference and in hindsight i i reflect back on it it reminds me of the the homebrew computer club if you look at like the early days of um apple and like kind of the people working on pcs and they all looked kind of shaggy you know so it was a little bit of that crew and i remember thinking this is kind of a this is kind of a weird crew you know like do i really want to be the bitcoin person if i gonna start to build something in this space because i talked to a lot of my friends about it at that time and they were all like i don't really get it like what is this bitcoin thing that you're getting into it seems kind of scammy and so my friends didn't understand it and i had a lot of self-doubt about it at that time actually because i was like ",
        "24": "i think i want to create maybe something in this space to try to help this thing grow and like just to play around with the technology but all my friends think it's kind of silly so i started working on a prototype basically nights and weekends just on my laptop and i i was thinking my whole mental model at that time was you know um smtp is the protocol that powers email but most people don't want to run their own email server they want they want to use gmail or something like that for the security and backups and the mobile device the cloud storage and everything and same thing with git i was like git was a really cool decentralized protocol but people wanted you know github to make it easier to use and it was hosted and everything so i was like all right well if bitcoin is his new protocol i'm going to make the host of the gmail or the github of this new protocol and you know eventually called it coinbase it had some working titles at that time and um i remember going to those early bitcoin meetups and some of the people they they ",
        "25": "i told them i was like yeah i'm working on like this hosted bitcoin wallet tries to make it easier to use and stuff and they were like why would you make a hosted bitcoin wallet it's just gonna get hacked like everybody you know everybody is trying to hack into these things and i was like that's true you know but i think there's going to have to be some company that gets built in this space because otherwise like the average person is not going to be able to use bitcoin if they have to run it locally on their device and so i was sort of almost trying to talk myself out of it like man if i get like really into this thing this could just be all-consuming but a very like a stroke of luck happened which is that um and i was kind of afraid to quit my job too by the way i was like airbnb is doing really well do i really want to do this i'm not sure and what i did was i applied the y combinator which is a startup incubator and the team there and paul graham was the first people who wrote me a check for 150k and they're like okay maybe you're not crazy this is like kind of a cool idea and i really looked up to them and so if they thought i was not crazy ",

        "27": "i went around and just tried to collect as many intros as i could to these investors and i remember a lot of them were really skeptical like we coinbase was not one of the hot companies at demo day even though we ended up being probably along with instacart one of the most valuable companies out of that batch out of the 100 or so that were in there but at demo day not that many investors kind of were interested in it and i was trying to raise a million dollars after that because i wanted to go hire some people and really build off team and i was barely able to get 600k so i raised less than the goal that i had but i just decided to go back to work and that's kind of where i eventually met frederickson who ended up co-founding coinbase with me you know coinbase probably would not exist without frederick so he he was an amazing compliment and just brought like such energy and force and enthusiasm and we eventually got a little bit of a team together and uh figured out the killer feature which was people actually want to buy bitcoin on coinbase not just have a hosted wallet and that was kind of an interesting moment as ",

        "72": "well so i'd say we've always had a um try to reach out to regulators proactively to work with them so that's not new that's that was true from the earliest days of coinbase it's still true today but you know if if we get something from a regulator like a like a subpoena that we think crosses the line and doesn't follow the law or you know we we're not afraid to push back on it and by the way it's it's very expensive for us as a company to do that like not not just in terms of some potential reputational risk with them but you know just mark the money for these these lawyers and everything is like kind of crazy for a small company you know that irs situation that you mentioned that was an example where we got kind of what i would characterize as like a dragnet subpoena where they said hey we need the information on all customers over this time period and that's not the intention behind subpoenas the way the law is written there needs to be some kind of reasonable expectation that the law has been violated you can't just go to any you can't just go to google and say give me the date on all your customers like so we challenged that um with them ",

        "92": "it depends where you fall on the spectrum right like compared to fidelity or something like that we're like way out here we're taking way more risk but compared to you know the other some of the other exchanges out there that are probably being a bit more aggressive we're probably taking we have a little bit more of a conservative approach and the calculus in my mind for that is that i want us to be a company that stands the test of time and doesn't get taken out by some kind of enforcement action or cascade of events or or whatever and so i'm playing for the long term here i don't i know that this is going to take a long time to get people comfortable with this technology and i don't want to cut corners in in the short term and like certainly put the company or myself at risk no it makes sense like it's your business you know you can make the decisions which suit you you want to grow your business i get it it was just interesting to hear that um i've got a couple couple more tough questions then we can get back onto some of the nicer ones so i have to talk to you about hacking team it's a really i know it's a tough one and you've taken a lot of i think well deserved criticism for this ",
        "93": "one this is this is a very hard one where i can't rationalize any of the decisions and mistakes but it's good to get out in the open let's talk about what happened here obviously you wanted to buy some software and ended up purchasing neutrino which was obviously linked to the hacking team do you want to talk about what happened there like as candidly as you can yeah sure so i think that's definitely an area where we made a mistake so you know like i talked about earlier we wanted to build out some of our blossom analytics capability in-house and you know whenever you're doing that you can kind of make a decision about we want to build something ourselves we want to try to buy something as a start to the team or invest in something it maybe is the third option so in this case we we have a team that does corporate development m a they looked at the landscape and we did identify a couple potential targets for acquisition where we went on and did some diligence on the team but most of our diligence was around the technology itself and um the team ",
        "94": "that we would um get like the engineers and things like that what we failed to do was the diligence that was kind of more around our values and our culture and that kind of thing and so when we did make the acquisition we started to see a lot of noise online about people saying hey you know do you know who you just acquired and that's where i started to look into it along with the team and we realized okay you know we might have hired some black cats here or people who at least are gray and don't have there there was some you know they probably drew the line where we would not have drawn the line about the kind of people they were working with and so at that point we kind of had to go make it a tough decision and go talk with these people and say you know how much of this is true like what actually happened there was a lot of pressure i remember at that time where people were saying like you need to fire them you need to fire them you'd fire them and look i you know i was like out of town i needed to come back and fly back i was like i'm not going to fire these people without like talking to them first and actually understanding what really happened because i don't want to ",
        "95": "i think it's just kind of an unethical thing to like because someone's angry on twitter you don't fire them without even like talking to them so we did go do some diligence we talked to them and we said all right like this part we probably it's ours it's our mistake we should have told you this before we acquired you and we tried to create a win-win just exit agreement with them that was like took our responsibility for it you can't work at coinbase but you know we do need to kind of pivot this team and so we then had a tough job of sort of rebuilding that team with with new people and and getting it to a place where we had the technology working as described so i think the main thing we learned from that is there's additional diligent steps we've got to do in m a and like a lot of things like a lot of m a deals things are moving quick you know because like the competitive process you've got to like check the everything as close as you can but you got to make a decision and so we moved too quick on that one how involved is someone like yourself in the due diligence process is it just an external job and someone gives you a report are you ",
        "96": "yourself responsible for doing part of the due diligence so at that size of company i think we were probably doing i don't know we've probably done like five or six kind of m a deals that year um at that size i had not met with them prior to us signing the agreement not personally at least it wasn't until we realized there was a problem afterwards that i got involved so we do we do a number of apple hires every year and for everyone that we do we probably look at 10 deals so there's a lot of there's a whole team that just does nothing but that and i i typically don't meet with those teams before they come on board right okay yeah because this this is the one that like i mean there's a few things that make it really difficult to defend coinbase at times and i think i think you see it in one way and people think another way you're on the inside people on the outside but this this one is really really tough to rationalize you know i'm just going to quote reporters without borders for the first time compiled a list of five corporate enemies of the internet ",

        "99": "nobody wants to work at a company where you throw people under the bus when they when they leave so i what i can tell you is that we we met with everybody on the team and we said okay who who was there like a real question mark about given this past examples that you just mentioned and really all of the key people or there was some kind of question mark or reputational or values issue uh were exited from the company there was a handful of engineers that were lower level folks that we felt like they were not like the decision makers they weren't as culpable and frankly we needed their help to transition some of the technology to actually be able to use it so i feel i feel good about like the way we kind of cleanly exited that and did it with respect for those people because it was our mistake you know they they were people who said hey i thought we were getting acquired and we were joining this company and the minute minute later they were getting fired like that's that's a really bad experience for them too so all around you know we just we just messed up and we tried to do the best we could for everybody involved ",
