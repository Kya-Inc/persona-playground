        "0": "okay uh let's this is i think a good jumping off point to an interesting discussion that blew up on twitter earlier this week which is we can't keep up with all the politics the the rhetoric the vitriol and this polarization so uh coinbase co-founder and ceo brian armstrong wrote a letter saying hey listen if you uh want to talk about politics that's fine not at my company anymore we're going to have a no politics rule no debating the stuff and we're going to be ultra ultra focus focused i'm sorry at work and you can check your politics at the door when you read this sax you've come out in support of brian armstrong what was your take on his position about leave your politics at the door when you get to work right well i think i think what brian so i did i did compliment it um his his manifesto and i think uh are you an investor i i am i'm a small investor in coinbase um ",
        "1": "and uh and and i'm friendly with brian and so i i certainly you know like the idea of defending him against unfair attacks but um i also genuinely like the manifesto um and i think you know his argument kind of boils down to three components i think number one that having these debates on every issue whatever the issue du jour is pulls the company's focus away from its core mission which he really emphasized and um you know that mission mission is challenging enough in its own right um second he was saying that in something i've said before as well which is just that politics is just increasingly divisive in our society it's just inherently divisive and therefore it's uh corrosive to team cohesion and the more you have of that in your company the worse it is for you know the team and i think the third thing he he mentioned which i thought was really interesting is that the freewheeling debate of or discussion of politics you know like like that we're having ",
        "2": "here but we kind of have our own little safe zone here it risks uh hurt feelings or misunderstandings that can become hr issues because people can then complain about they feel unsafe they feel unsafe and they report to and so that's a further disruption in this podcast i'll be honest there's a couple of moments well i think well i think one of the reasons why this pod sort of works is because we're all we're all friends and uh we've created a safe space for us to have these conversations but the workplace is very different it's not you know and and what i read brian trying to do is to reimpose a true safe space by saying leave your politics at the door now i think he's been deliberately misconstrued by by critics who want to say that well you have to leave your conscience at the door you know that's not true he's not saying that you can't have your own political views or contribute to causes that you like but you just got to do it on your own time kind of like mr han said in fast times at richmond high you know like do that on your own time um and ",
        "3": "and that makes sense to me i think like i mean look i think about this from the point of view of one of the employees working at one of these companies that doesn't want to be a party to the debate um if i'm an engineer at google or coinbase i go into work and i am captive right i don't have the option of not showing up to work if i go to a rally i have the option of saying i'm going to go to this rally and walk away because i don't like the speaker or i'm going to go to the rally because i want to participate in this dialogue or this debate i can't do that at work so it's unfair for work which is a place that i as an employee have to go to every day to be a forum for people to express themselves on political points that i may or may not agree with but more importantly may or may not want to actually be a party to the discussion around um and i think that's the most important thing to note here is like it's not about enabling the free speech of the employees that want to debate it's about the protecting the work space ",
        "4": "for the employees that don't want to debate and don't want to be exposed to that um and that's really important as chamath is a person of color who um you know have i'm sure some has some strong feelings about what we've seen in terms of police shootings or maybe in your own personal life experience facing racism uh again as a person of color what are your thoughts on the workplace is it is it possible for you to leave that at the door that was the criticism i think i saw from the you know people who were supportive of blm and they said the background here was they were trying to get brian to explicitly say black lives matter and to you know have the company rally behind that um and that he didn't he didn't want to have that be part of the work environment and that he was offering people four to six months severance if they would leave if they don't like the new rules so what are your thoughts i think that this whole thing became a quagmire unnecessarily ",
        "5": "i think that he showed um a lot of naivety um and frankly like a little bit of stupidity really um it was really poorly written and that's why it's been so misunderstood and misconstrued in my opinion i think a lot of what he had to say was valid but when it was so poorly presented and you know the the essay was like eight minutes and it was rambling and the mission was like you know 97 down on the you know and it's just like it was a convoluted [ __ ] mess so if i had to do it again if i were him or if i was his advisor and he had asked me you know to proofread the essay what i would have said is more of the following which is our mission which is you know i think to create financial liberty or something something like that you guys can find out what it is for the whole world is unbelievably important we will talk about every issue through the lens of achieving our mission and we ",
        "6": "will be disciplined about saying which things matter and which things don't so for example if somebody says listen i really believe in spaying and neutering dogs the right answer shouldn't be hey shut the [ __ ] up it says okay how does that allow us to maximize our users how does that allow us to achieve our mission why does it allow us to achieve our mission and if you ask the question why four or five times in the very first principles way you'll get to the answer so i would have rather said we are going to train people how to understand what builds up to our mission and what is otherwise something that you should leave at home and in that context there are a lot of things actually that are political that need to be brought especially into a company like coinbase which is working in crypto which is all about eliminating the financial barriers of people that don't have access to it like you are trying to dismantle an extremely ",
        "7": "exclusionary part of the economy and so there are potentially many movements that matter and those movements in countries in which you will want to gain users may look like political movements well and that was jack dorsey's point he uh so i just think yeah so i just think it was a it was a it was kind of a too superfic it was very silicon valley-esque reaction it was emotional um it was a little insecure and it to me it missed the mark because there was a lot of validity in what he was saying but presented in an kind of in a lens of you know silicon valley [ __ ] and it was not well thought through so if he had rewritten it and he had said 99 of what he said but through the lens of why we're going to think about a first principle's way of defining how everything ladders into the mission he will train his employees instead what he created was a schism and ",
        "8": "a decision point and i'm not sure that that's how you maximize value in 2020 as a ceo because at the end of the day you have to deal with an entire population cohort that is that are in their 20s early 30s teenagers that will eventually want to work for you and whether we like it or not they're different and one of the things you need to do if you're going to run an enormous company is understand the psychology of your employees understand the psychology of how movements and decisions are organized and then play to win and it's no different than anybody else if you want to be in the job you know to be the starting point guard for the warriors you got to know how to [ __ ] pass the ball and if you're going to be the power forward you have to know how to do a certain set of things that are different than that and so i would sort of have framed it there because i think there was a lot of goodness in what he said but presented in a pretty shitty manner i think it's good he brought up the topic i do think there's a tactical issue here and he he could have laid out the ground rules for i think to your point jamal of how we should talk about uh politics at ",
        "9": "work and what are the ground rules i think the number one issue here which people don't talk about is that slack and email and forums inside of companies have created a massive distraction and when somebody goes into the random channel which is built into slack i know this is in the weeds but i have seen this happen at multiple companies now slack infects a company somebody creates a room about a topic whether it's trump or police violence or immigration whatever it is and then people want to sound off on that and now you've got an electronic form where people are talking about highly charged issues that makes people feel unsafe and so what i told my companies was um the two companies i run you could talk about politics if you want to go for a walk with somebody and have coffee or lunch and you want to have a two-hour discussion about it go for it please do not put this in electronic form because it's a massive distraction uh and there'll be a record that could create downstream human ",
        "10": "resources issues to your report sex i have a suggestion and this is an organizational design experiment and maybe somebody listening will implement at their company allow 100 free form debate about anything one condition you literally need to have a soapbox and like in the 1880s hyde park in london you put the soapbox someplace in a safe space where you can go and you can talk and people who want to listen will listen and people who need to work can work and people who don't want to listen don't have to be forced to what's the digital version of that that you're suggesting a literal room campus a literal place in your office you put the soap you have a soapbox you grab it you put it on the ground you stand on it and you say it and if you're not willing to do that then right you know are you saying that there's no digital version of that because what i'm saying is that two things one is the digital version is actually training people to ask why why does it matter now the reason ",
        "11": "why it's important to ask that is because somebody may say i'll use jason's example that he loves we need to support the uyghurs in china the best way to do that is to proliferate our software in the following way because it will free them from ensavement of the chinese and will give them access to financial independence wow i mean okay that seems to be paying off the mission so if you would if so you gotta give freedom for people to come up with these ideas because it may the first version of this idea may may not actually be what the final version is in the final version maybe the killer feature so i in the digital forum in the slacks it should be why respect that's a very respectful question it shouldn't it should not be in any digital forum because it leads to chaos because we see that on twitter and what's happening is the twitter derangement that we all suffer from is now infected inside the community the communication system that runs the operating system of the company go ahead exactly yeah that that's the thing ",
        "12": "right yes i do i do agree with jake on this one so so look i mean chamath is right that i'm sure i'm sure tremoth would have written a better letter but i think we understand the gist of what brian was trying to say and actually i thought it took a lot of courage to write it and what he's basically saying is that politics has become so divisive in our society that i mean it would be nice if we could have these reasonable debates the way that we're having this discussion inside companies we didn't have to have these artificial restrictions but we do we have to you know it's the same reason you know that we have the separation of church and state is because people couldn't stop killing each other over religious wars and so finally we had you know the treaty of westphalia to stop it and what brian's basically proposing is a is a treaty for the workplace because we cannot get along around politics but david he is the ceo of an 8 billion company could he not have hired somebody to edit that essay okay well i mean look i i just to me it's like if it's meaning if it's seriously well thought through and it and if it was ",
        "13": "as important as westphalia you would probably have a couple proofreaders corporate corporate version okay it's not it's not historically it could have been polished for sure here is jack dorsey's response and i'll have you guys respond to it i think it's in your wheelhouse in terms of what you said chamoth bitcoin aka crypto is direct activism against an unverifiable and exclusionary financial system which definitely affects so much of our society important to at least acknowledge and connect the related societal issues your customers face daily this leaves people behind i think he's right you have to view this problem not through the lens of your own emotions not even through the lens of the frustrations of your employees you have to help shift the discussion to say why does this achieve our mission and just constantly in a thoughtful respectful way ask why and by the fourth or fifth why it will either be something that doesn't matter and you can dismiss it quickly or something that actually is rooted in fact and probably is something you need ",
        "14": "to pay attention to and maybe the way that the conversation started was probably not with the right language that people given the chance would have framed it differently okay the worst take uh according to the internet's uh twitter's ability to ratio people which is when you get more comments than likes um which is not normally how it works people are actually taking the time to explain to you how bad your take was as opposed to liking it is what a ratio is if you don't know um goes to dick casalo who's a friend of ours uh me first capitalists who think you can separate society from business are going to be the first people lined up against the wall and shot in the revolution i'll be ha i mean that's that's enough to get you ratioed and have this thing go supernova i mean mike cernovich is retweeting this and losing like his mind over it you know that the former ceo of twitter is inciting violence he's a comedian as well um de costello so i think he's joking here and but he adds the punk the exclamation ",
        "15": "point i'll happily provide video commentary yeah here here's here's here's my uh disagreement with with dick and with jack is ultimately the societal value of a company doesn't come from whatever platitudes or political statements its co makes but rather from the quality of its products and the impact of its products and in that sense dick and jack are living in a glass house i mean twitter is a sewer of political diatribe and polemical hate you know it's i don't know anyone who feels better uh you know after spending time on twitter you know if if facebook is like cigarettes you know i i don't know what twitter is i mean it's like fentanyl or something yeah so so ultimately you know maybe jack should spend his time figuring out how to make twitter into a less socially divisive product instead of you know because just issuing woke plateaus is not going to do ",
        "16": "it i agree with the i agree with that i don't think platitudes does it all i'm saying is you have to view it through the lens of i want to become the most relevant company possible and achieve the most impact and i think that there are a lot of times where some of these issues when presented politically underlying it is actually some feature or some capability or some way of seeing the problem that unlocks more demand that can help you win and not knowing a priori what the answers to those questions are it's important to train people on a framework versus say you can't talk because i guarantee you what will happen is somebody with some killer feature will be too scared to say something because they're not sure how to say it well and you and i both know because we've seen many companies that have gone through that cycle those companies decay and die yeah i think it'd be great if a policy like this wasn't necessary i mean it's i agree it's suboptimal but i think it's it's caused by the fact that people just can't get along around politics ",
        "17": "anymore friedberg what is your take on ultimately how coinbase winds up the year or two after this do they get more resumes of hyper-talented people who want to embrace a politics social issue-free workplace or do millennials and you know gen c and this next group of talented folks say i don't want to work for somebody who doesn't want to talk about these issues at work and then at the production board where you have a factory where you build uh companies do you have some rule around this yourself or thoughts about how you run your companies i think the more clearly you define culture the more successful your company will be and right or wrong about whether or not you enable the debate in the discussion and how you define the forums for kind of political discussion within your company the fact that there is a clear definition and delineation around this point i think removes the ",
        "18": "uncertainty and i think he'll do exactly what he's hoping to do which is to get people to leave and to attract other people that better fit with that cultural model i want to put my game face on i want to go to work and i want to win the game i'm here to play i'm not here to [ __ ] around i'm not here to do other stuff i want this job because i believe in this mission and i want this company to succeed in what it's trying to do and i think other places that allow people to run around and you know do things that they may or may not appreciate other people doing or and you have this kind of low definition kind of culture where some people are happy some people are unhappy it all kind of you know slows things down and and um and i wouldn't kind of encourage anyone to um to let that happen i think it's really important to just define how it is you want to operate be really clear about the rules and the boundaries and then um that i agree with as well i mean i think it's very much within his right and i think it took i do applaud his courage in doing it i ",
        "19": "just think that it misses the mark because i think it was too emotional i think he could do a 2.0 version and just keep building on the manifesto and say hey based on the feedback i got here's how we're going to do it no discussion here on the election reid hastings put out that fantastic uh powerpoint that i think we all know really well the cultural playbook from netflix and when did he put that out like it's almost like a decade ago no two decades ago was 2000 2001 and he's continued to refine it right if you look at there's recent iterations of it and they continue to kind of do a better job of defining um you know uh how do they intend to operate uh with people um and i think it's it's only continue to reinforce the innovation that drives that company into the hundred billion dollar plus valuation it's earned yes and if you if there's one important thing which is that there's a meaningful difference in the average age of a netflix employee and the average age of a silicon valley company now that may be also part of it as well ",
        "20": "i i think the one thing that brian could clarify is that you don't have to check your conscience at the door you it's not we're not saying that you can't have political views you're allowed to say things on twitter or take political stands or donate to wherever you want it's just that the company itself is going to be a demilitarized zone you know we're not going to bring we're not going to bring these contentious divisive debates that really aren't related to our core mission inside the company so we can all work better so we can all work better as a team towards the reason that we all join this company but that's totally fair but you know while i'm saying all i'm saying again i'll just say it again that is such an important thing to say you could have had it proof for it a couple times you didn't could have been could have come across the way you were saying it it didn't have to be written by gpt-3 you know what i mean also i think that it was a the the dunk he did afterwards where he's like and by the way if you don't like it here's four months severance get the [ __ ] out that was a pretty uh ",
        "21": "aggressive move as well all right i don't know how you guys felt i think i kind of like the gangster nature i like i think it's i think it's great it's like if i'm on the team and i believe in what he just said i feel great that he's flushing the [ __ ] out and if i don't agree with it it's like [ __ ] yeah i'll take it you know like it's really clear and i think the clear-cut definition of culture is what every company needs to kind of pursue and it's an ongoing pursuit and you can always do a better job with it and culture is what you choose not to do as much as it is what you do right i'm not going to talk about politics i think freeburg is totally right it takes a lot of courage to say here's what i believe and if you don't if you don't believe it then it's okay for you to leave and here's a severance package that takes a lot of courage so i applaud him for that yeah i mean look it's a free country and we all have limited time we should all go work on the mission that is most important and inspiring to us and coinbase has a very specific mission that brian's defining he's trying to find it clearly and if that mission is important and inspiring to you then go work there and if it's not then go work at the place that you know ",
        "22": "where that you know where the mission does inspire you and it may be a startup or maybe you know a political organization whatever it is go go do that thing that's most meaningful to you that's kind of my interpretation of what he was saying all right as we wrap here it was hard for me to interpret because it was so poorly written well also i mean it was also like a huge bomb on twitter and people's reaction to it was based upon i think how they feel at this moment in time and a lot of people feel this is why i'm sorry but communications is important how you say things what you say yeah style is really important yeah whether it's take the time get it right yeah "
