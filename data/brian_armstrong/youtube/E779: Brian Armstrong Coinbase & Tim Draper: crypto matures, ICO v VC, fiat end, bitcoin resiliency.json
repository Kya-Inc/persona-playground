        "1": "ICO ok so I think you get the picture but one of the more successful and and really legitimate companies that come out of this surge of crypto has been our very own portfolio company coinbase which is a digital wallet and a transaction platform and so I'd like to invite coinbase is CEO Brian Armstrong who will be joining conversation with our own artist and doctor in residence or scientists rather Tim Draper and it'll be moderated by our good friend Jason Calacanis so please give them more warm welcome [Applause] [Music] everybody you're in for a real treat because we're gonna talk about some of the hottest cheese they always say never work with pets I need no animals no kids and no hey hey Brian how are you great to see you you ",
        "2": "started talking about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in about 2012 if I remember correctly you and I were on Hacker News and other places talking about it yeah and people thought you were crazy you leaned into it and your first project if I remember correctly was you wanted people to watch a video and get paid a fraction of a Bitcoin take to watch the video this idea I think I saw ICO last week for 300 million dollars but this was your wasn't this your first like little stab at how crypto currency might touch the public well there was a lot of people in the early days that I wanted to get involved in digital currency because everybody did think I was crazy and so I was just going around talking to anybody who would listen and if they could do it on a video or in person or anything like that I would send them a tiny bit of Bitcoin and I probably sent tens of a Bitcoin to hundreds of people you know which later have come back to me and been like wow this is a ton of money so you got to get when you early stages you got to get out there and hustle and get ",
        "3": "traction any way you can but that idea if that existed today I was just thinking this could be a revolutionary idea if people on youtube were getting paid for their attention to something that in fact people are saying the next Facebook will be a cryptocurrency based Facebook do you believe that well I'm not sure if it entirely replaced Facebook but I do love this idea that all user-generated content today has basically been incentivized by things like upvotes or like buttons or stars or followers or you can think of it as to karma your dopamine dopamine the addiction yeah I mean even Wikipedia right is just people collaborating via karma and so most of internet innovation has happened because of that using that mechanism and now a lot of internet innovation can probably happen with real monetary value being transferred every on reddit could be a bit of monetary value and you could have people actually earning a living on reddit all day long moderating or submitting comment or answering questions so that is a pretty exciting trend that could happen Tim you immediately when you find a new ",
        "4": "technology assume and I think this is probably your superpower if you did have one as a as an investor it's been pretty exciting to watch your default state is to believe or imagine that the technology will succeed this gets you into trouble and this also gets you to the point where when mount GOx famously the store of a bunch of bitcoins I guess one of the first Bitcoin marketplaces went under because they didn't know how to build the technology properly you for some reason decided to put 20 million dollars to work in an auction to buy coins that are now worth I believe ten to twenty times that amount this is a twenty million dollar position that's now a three or four hundred million dollar position is that correct so or directionally correct this this the scientist in me says yes basically that is correct the artist in me says this is a transformative opportunity and to take ",
        "5": "it on was to drive it I yes I looked at it I met Brian I'm I missed him the first time but my son got him yep and and I saw the value the excitement behind this and I said this is potentially transformative it is going to probably disintermediate me and the venture capital business it's probably going to transform anything financial and then it just and then I believe before I even made the for the big purchase I I knew that it could be that the blockchain could be used as this perfect ledger and that that perfect ledger would make it so that ",
        "6": "if my accounting bill would go to zero and potentially my legal bill would go to zero and protect potentially my tax bill would be dropped by 90% because I think that now with the blockchain it's pretty clear in my mind that that all those new technologies can can govern us better more effectively and more globally seeing what it is Fiat governments you bought it yes and I do that and thank you for recognizing my well I wouldn't say it's a superhero trait but it's like like a optimistic trade yeah that when I look at a new company and and you can pass this on to all your entrepreneurial friends I am looking to see how high is up how great ",
        "7": "can this be if it works I'm not as concerned if if if there's a higher if there's a high likelihood of failure that's ok with me well you actually know the exact amount of money you're gonna lose in failure but with the upside as we've seen in many of your investments whether it's hotmail Skype Tesla or the company before Tesla what was it called before Tesla it was still Tesla yeah yeah these investments were insane things to back so you knew how much you would lose millions to tens of millions of dollars but nobody could ever predict the size they got to almost everybody underestimates the upside is that right yep site potential at least yes because the world is bigger than people can fathom and I think travel is great and I think this kind of a meeting of people from all over the world is great because people start to recognize how many people really have so if you have a new ",
        "8": "breakthrough idea it can spread around the world fat faster than ever before and it affects a lot of people and it can be any norm this mission and if you play your cards right along the way you can really make an enormous change in the world and so you bought twenty million dollars in Bitcoin at the Mount GOx and it became worth three or four hundred million and then you have over a billion dollars in cryptocurrency Holdings is that correct it's a yes or no question but aunt Ryan to me will have to go back and research this question and the artist in me says I'm thrilled I have money to invest in more entrepreneurs more more great things and progress will move forward will cure cancer we'll get off this planet we'll make this planet a better place to live it'll it'll all be us alright we'll take it as a yes and a yes so tell me ",
        "9": "with coinbase and there's a lot of coins now we got coin list coin base and and everybody's using the coin term you started this before the ico craze now I've been studying this and I'm an angel investor and I interview people and I met the Tasos people and a bunch of different of these ICS and I thought wow these are people who are doing their first startup largely in some cases they've not written any lines of code they have written a white paper it's sometimes over ten pages long it's they're wonderful to read should we be giving those people over tens of millions to hundreds of millions dollars people without track records with a white paper and do you have a fear watching all these transactions occur that this ICO thing could wind up blowing up in the laps of everybody in the crypto ",
        "10": "community and then tarnishing it mm-hmm so is it a scam and are you worried about the potential cratering of it yeah so I do think the ICO craze is exactly that it's it's a craze it's a bubble and it's a little out of control right now I would not be surprised if in the next six months or 12 months there's a some enforcement actions by the SEC some of these get slapped pretty hard and there's a bit of a correction in the and honestly we're probably due for that digital currency has gone through four of these cycles now where there's a big run-up and a correction back but it's at a new plateau every time and it kind of goes up and back and up and back so the ico trend underneath it I think there's something real there which is that there's a lot of people in the world who can't raise money easily they can't get into a room like this in Silicon Valley or meet Tim Draper and so they can meet Tim actually yeah well he's a Matteo you'll meet Tim Draper University yeah but I'm very accessible there are lots of people who don't know ",
        "11": "any investors I remember actually when I moved to Silicon Valley I didn't know a single person who identified as a investor or an angel investor and so I had to apply to Y Combinator and that's how I got started to meet a few people but many people don't have that opportunity and so the ico thing is real that's gonna help a lot of the oil part funded explain to us as entrepreneurs in the room and investors what is the real part for you when you when you look at it what is the part that makes you excited say this is a sustainable technological innovation that could change what well there's I think of it as two things one is its crowdfunding so and it's globally clout crowdfunding so now if you if you're a kid in India with a great idea you know you could actually have 17,000 people put in 50 bucks all of the world in 30 minutes like that was never possible for the legal the legal paperwork was one reason like you never were gonna be able to meet those people was another reason and they could never get you the $50 without spending less than $50 is another reason so that is a by itself is a great innovation the ",
        "12": "micro transaction fluidity global do it all in what signal or telegram chatroom yeah where are they doing all these in signal or telegram it's all over yeah well I know as I opened up one of these and I had like 12 invites to give money to failed entrepreneurs where people have never heard of yeah a little scary yeah I mean you said the second piece well the second piece is that there's people who are creating new protocols like the ones that I think are the most exciting are these kind of utility tokens they call it like file coin and golem and there are ways to essentially pay people for either storage or computing power all over the world and it does make sense to me that those should have their native token just because it allows you know essentially the early adopters to turn you turn them into evangelists so it's a great way as an entrepreneur to create a network effect gifting these tokens to the early people and then they go spread the word for you so that's a pretty cool innovation to everybody let me take a minute to thank my friend Scott Walker yes he runs the Walker ",
        "13": "corporate law group and they are as you know if you've been a fan of this program a boutique law firm and they specialize in the representation of entrepreneurs and their startups yes they are a great firm and all their lawyers have decades of experience there are no junior associates working at the Walker corporate law group so they're not going to get on-the-job training with your startup no they're experts and they encourage fixed fees because they think billable hours while those reward inefficiency mergers and acquisitions licensing agreements terms of services privacy policies they do it all and if you want to talk to the founder himself Scott Edie Walker you can call him directly four one five nine seven nine ninety nine ninety eight four one five that's San Francisco nine seven nine nine nine nine eight or you can email him Scott at Walker corporate law Scott at Walker corporate law or visit Walker corporate law comm and make sure when you talk to Scott you tell him you're ",
        "14": "uncle Jason sent you okay let's get back to this amazing episode [Music] Tim you are one of the most risk-taking investors we've ever seen here in the valley and on a global basis when you look at it do you get concerned that the discipline we learned in the Bay Area let's say specifically of okay let's go to an incubator accelerator or a university in your case let's do a seed round friends-and-family seed angel series a that taking all of those up until the d round and compressing them into one round on a document is a little bit too much fluidity or free do you think it's just like screw it everybody knows that they're gonna lose their money or they have that great risk and so if everybody's opting into it they should be allowed to throw that $50 in where do you sit with this well reconcile it I do know that it was a big surprise for us when both Paizo sand Bank or raise more than a hundred ",
        "15": "million dollars each and now that they're worth six or seven hundred and pays us and maybe two hundred in bank or because of the appreciation of the underlying currencies which they did not sell right and the yeah and the excitement around the - yeah but and and so we did have a serious discussion saying well you know I've seen money destroy companies because if it's if they get too much money right away they think they'll hire all my friends I'll you know how to throw a few parties you know and just throw if there's a problem just throw money at it well that isn't the way great companies get built they get built a little at a time and and so our discussion in both those cases was take a bunch of that money and just say ",
        "16": "that's our endowment and that's what we're going to be using to make sure that this coin is there for you forever and and then take just a certain amount per year and use that to build the coin make it awesome and so so it's very interesting because I when I when people say describe an ICO to me I say okay the artist in me says okay if you've got a mission of some sort you now have three vehicles to go after that mission it used to be that you'd have you could start a for-profit business that's profitable and grows and spreads that way you could start a non-profit business that is for the good of society and you need to make sure it's sustainable so it grows and spreads to society and now you can do an Icee oh it's a different thing and what you're ",
        "17": "investing it is not the company you're investing in a coin and the or you're not investing you're buying a coin and by buying that coin you are either getting behind the mission getting behind the movement of that group and hoping that the movement becomes so big that maybe that coin becomes more valuable or maybe you're just enthusiastic about the mission and and for an entrepreneur yes it's a great way to raise money currently the end of it last the individual investor has been cut out completely out of the growth of generally stage for the last 15 years yeah citizen combust yeah because going public now as the companies have to be worth five or ten billion dollars before anybody they want to take in public SEP ",
        "18": "for some spax which we are innovating on yeah and if the if companies are the if it's that late in the game then the public doesn't get to participate in the growth and the variability and the the drive of all of this entrepreneurial excitement they were looking for a vehicle to participate in and that's what this pent-up dimension and that was pent up demand and they all came into these eyes and now they're making money on the icos and now they're you know potentially losing their minds but but at some point they are doing what they were cut out to do and all our regulations have made it very difficult for companies to go public they've made it very difficult for if you had 20 dollars and you walked into B of a or Wells Fargo and said I want to open an account they would say no we don't want you yeah because it's gonna cost us two hundred dollars a year just to regulate your account right so ",
        "19": "all that regulation all that stuff that our government has put in there to protect us yeah has really destroyed and created more poverty than than any like you know scams would be anything else yeah it's really poverty is created by heavy regulation and in governments that think they know concept of accredited versus not accredited investors here in United States other countries don't have this and if you were a professor at Stanford making $150,000 a year teaching I don't know economics you would not be able to invest in private company it's like literally the professor who was teaching you how to be a wealth manager or econ 101 cannot be an accreditor how does this make any sense and and here are the people that are really interested in doing this young people who don't have a lot of money but they want to take chances and know that they're keeping ",
        "20": "down right and but the way they keep them down is by saying well we're protecting widows and orphans right and I'm not sure that it is a good idea I think people need to be really well educated like let's do everything we can to make sure everybody's really well educated and then let's let them go ahead and make the mistakes and do the things and take the risk that they should be taking when they're early in their careers yeah I mean what if we had them go to the SEC website and take a test and take a course and for a 50 dollar course and eight hours you could complete the course and all of a sudden now you're certified to invest in whatever you want that is a good idea why don't we want to send that to one of my friends at the SEC let's do that I won't hey Brian Jason don't live in fear fear is the mind killer it it is the ",
        "21": "mind killer isn't it oh yeah you weren't scared when you drove in that first p1 Tesla on the 280 and with the five-point harness on no I was excited it was like being on a rolling with a jet trap it was so cool Oh airbags kind of falling apart at that it wasn't at Tesla actually was an Ian yarn right yeah the right mobile yeah and it was amazing like a hundred miles an hour in six seconds I said pass right are you passed it looked like it was made with a five-point bail and they were wrong and yeah the problem at the belt is the entire frame was coming apart and put together with Krazy Glue hey Brian you have 40 billion dollars in transactions to date on the system is that right or what's the latest number yeah something about around there how much what's the total value of the holdings you hold the asset correct yeah we do store digital currency on behalf of our customers that ",
        "22": "turns out to be a difficult thing for people to do securely so we try to provide that as a service a lot of people tell me this is a really bad idea to put your currency in a server whether yours or on competitors yeah yeah that you should put it on a stick and then split the stick and put it in two different locations yeah which is the better idea well there's not one that's better I think there's a substantial group of people out there who want both so I think of it this way there there's a subset of people who they're a little bit tech savvy right they want to have full control and they want to be able to store their own private keys and that's how they feel like they're in full control their money I I totally get that and we actually have another product called Toshi which is a user controlled wallet which allows people to do that there's a whole other large category of people I'd probably say it's a larger group actually that doesn't trust themselves to store it that securely that and this is why you know use use Gmail for email instead of running your own email server yes not all of my money it's true right so where do you ",
        "23": "keep your money do you keep it in which one do you keep it in and which one would you tell your mom or dad or brother or sister or yeah you know son or daughter to keep it how would you advise your close family members and how do you yourself keep your currency well I have all my digital currency stored in coinbase but as I mentioned we have some products that allow you to store it yourself can I test them all but I'd say I have the majority of it's stored on coinbase servers we've got a little bit of a know your buyer Silicon Valley Edition going on right now with in some cases the Russians or Saudi Arabia or other countries being very active and wanting access to the asset class here abstence ibly to make money but it could be for other reasons I guess people are speculating I don't know if I buy that how do you know who your buyers are do you care is it your business to know yeah so for better or worse I mean coinbase is a very regulated business some of the things that Tim was mentioning I mean we are regulated as a money transmitter in all the states of ",
        "24": "the United States we also have a bit license in New York we have an e money license in Europe we're registered as a money service business at the federal level so in any two or three month period we have some auditor on site from regulator coming to check us out so one of the requirements of that is that we do know our customer and so people are not anonymous on coinbase the way I think of this is that exchanges like coinbase where you can convert you know fiat currency or local currency into and out of digital currency those are going to be regulated but the crypto to crypto world that's where people are largely operating unregulated today kind of like you know you can which is where the ico is live yeah crypto so that's just peer-to-peer it's like Kazaa it's like Napster yeah it's actually even less like those because those had a central company or a brand publishing it would be more like Nutella I guess back in the day where was just an open source project anybody could make a client or a server yeah it's like SMTP under underlying email or tcp/ip underline the Internet or something like that ",

        "27": "practical use in the world because we were sitting here I don't know five years ago talking about if four years ago and you know some cafe decided to let you buy coffee with Bitcoin I'm hoping they never transferred that Bitcoin out into cash because the discussion then was well what if Bitcoin drops it was at six dollars back then when they started taking it so if they didn't every two cups of coffee would be worth $7,000 right now just do you see will it move past a money store a transfer financial tool and does it need to Tim or is this enough because this seems to be enough I I actually look at it as a great store of value but it also I suspect people say are you gonna sell your Bitcoin and I think we'll wait no that's my currency because Milan's to one day spend it or ",
        "28": "invest it it's not - it's not to sell it because every time I think about oh yeah which I sell it well then what do I sell it into I sell it into an old-fashioned fiat currency it's like taking whatever a dollar bill and and turning it into shells from the old days yeah and cigarettes in prison yeah yeah cigarettes in prison it and and I think I come in handy I think wait do I want a currency that is tied to some artificial landmass government that is getting more and more bloated and will probably collapse under its own weight or or do I want something where I can move it from place to place or I can go to another place and just pull it down what you're really the other question you're asking ",
        "29": "is can I spend it and and more and more places are taking it even Amazon's taking in in certain countries and and it's and I think we are probably in the u.s. are probably going to be the slowest to make it into a payment program because in Africa you know it's phone to phone and they'll they run it launches its own cryptocurrency in the next 10 years we're Senate rise who would care it's still land based it would be backed by the dollar I mean Aurora they've tried Aurora coin in in Iceland and that was a total disaster because the whole point is we're global we're no longer international we're global look around yeah they're from all over the world what do you think Ryan I agree there are governments that are looking at creating their own coins I think Canada China we keep seeing headlines Vail yeah aka ",
        "30": "Russia but I I think I agree with Tim it sort of defeats the purpose of a digital currency to me it should be a global decentralized thing if it's tied to one country I think the benefit of it is that it might have less volatility as a payment method in the short term if it mark to the dollar yeah but I kind of think that you know digital bitcoin is getting less and less volatile every year so in fact it was less volatile than some fiat currencies last year like the most volatile ones the Venezuelan Bulevar and but I think if you just play that trend out another five years you're gonna have digital currency be as stable as many fiat currencies in the world and so having one tied to one government is actually not as good as having a global decentralized one the common belief Brian is that Bitcoin because the miners are all in China getting free electricity at hydro dams and other places even coal plants etc they have the majority of the compute power and they will make the majority of the decisions how does that impact the future of Bitcoin in your mind that a ",
        "31": "bunch of marauding essentially gangsters in China who are getting free electricity stolen from the government are controlling the currency that you've based your entire business on well I'm gonna disagree with the premise of the question a little bit I I've met these I've met a number of these miners in China they're legitimate businessmen for my voice stealing electricity from hydro dams the ones I met weren't stealing it they are getting it from data centers okay yeah but I think answer your question more broadly so I mean you know Bitcoin mining is a little bit too centralized right now I would say that that is a risk I think there's other challenges in bit people even one thing I want to say is that theorem actually is the most exciting answer here because they're working on proof of stake which would actually eliminate mining and I think there's a good chance that and taze us too and she may be in the audience yeah yeah actually a number of digital currencies have made really good strides there if their aim wasn't even the first one and so I think in a few ",
        "32": "years most digital currency could be proof of stake and move away from mining with you great Tim what are your thoughts it's just an existential risk to Bitcoin is Bitcoin going to be the first person up the hill but the Betamax ultimately and that the value will move to Bitcoin cash or aetherium or TASIS well it's interesting that as I understand it the miners wanted us to all go toward Bitcoin cash and they had a concentrated effort to sell their Bitcoin and buy Bitcoin cash on November 11th and it kind of worked that coin cash went up to about $1,000 in Bitcoin cash dropped by about $1,000 well but it didn't really work because now they they should they did everything they could but I think it's just resilient Bitcoin has been resilient to all these things I thought when mal Cox went down that was ",
        "33": "the end it felt like the end and it yeah but we dropped about 10% in value it didn't drop at all so I mean it was so small it was such a small drop I thought whoa people really need this and it seems to be resilient people need this and so it's just gonna keep being there and keep spreading and as it spreads you know you have a network effect mmm so we know every system that can be gamed will be gamed if there's a financial and sedative then obviously there is even more reason to game the system ie hacking for credit cards or any other crime so this is a semi anonymous global fluid currency we've seen a ton of hacking occur how much of Bitcoin surge in price could be attributed potentially to manipulation Brian mmm I think how manipulated is it as currency how many the transactions are done to do what we ",
        "34": "just heard Drive cash up Bitcoin down and people try to manipulate it I mean I think of those as having short-term effects so in any given week or something you might see something being manipulated on one exchange or something like that but so any of it is that you know bitcoin is so big now it's well over 100 billion market cap so there's fewer and fewer people who can try to move the whole market right and as Tim pointed out with this example with Bitcoin cash the minute you try to do it there's another contingent who wants to fight you the other direction and so we have a pretty we have a maturing market on our hands could those original owners because the original owners of Bitcoin and the original miners have some large double-digit percentage in a small handful of accounts could they conceivably create and this is just a crazy scenario but thousands of accounts over the last five years move currency between them in order to manipulate it and we would not know about it I don't think so so one thing is that there is roughly 10% of Bitcoin ",
        "35": "is kind of locked up in the very early transactions but the nice thing about the blockchain is you can see if they ever move and those funds have never moved so they definitely aren't using it to manipulate the market but you know the question is does anybody still control the keys to those my guess is no because they would have moved by now it's it's a incredible amount of money and I'm sure the very first computer they were using to do development work on Bitcoin they would have moved the key at some point and also you know there's people like Hal Finney who some people think was one of the people who worked on Bitcoin who passed away so my guess is that those funds are lost to the histories of time and they'll never be recovered but nobody can say for sure you're all in aetherium now and your your Bitcoin love is faded is that fair to say uh I I own Bitcoin I own a theory on my own litecoin yeah but you don't love Bitcoin anymore you love a theory I'm talking about love right now I'm not talking about love history okay you're asking what my heart feels for it yes I'm ",
