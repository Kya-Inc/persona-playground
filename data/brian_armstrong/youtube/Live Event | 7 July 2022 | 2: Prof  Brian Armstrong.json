        "1": "talk i've done since the since the end of covert so i'm really happy to be here in person it makes it makes a great change i'm going to be talking to you about the opportunity for technology and how technology changes the world sorry if i could ask the guys in the control room to give me my presentation on the comfort monitor now the when you have a topic like that it's very easy to think i'm going to talk about the future i'm not a futurist once upon a time i was an engineer then i became a manager and now i'm at the vitz business school and i do research and lecturing and teaching in business science so i would call myself a business scientist so what we try to do is not make sort of lavish predictions about the future what we try to do in business science is understand how the world has worked ",
        "2": "how it does work and on the models that we develop in that the predictive power of those models allows us to think about the now and the future and how we respond so that's really the ground i want to go through today i just want to check how many engineers in the room quite a lot of you that's good accountants okay so it's just engineer so i can cover a lot of ground because you guys are good at absorbing information now i mentioned this is the first um public what i've done since the end of covert shortly before covert i did another one and i was desperately looking for a joke on the fourth industrial revolution or technological disruption so i googled all sorts of different phrases and i could find nothing clearly the world doesn't think technological disruption is a funny matter but eventually i found one which is very relevant to today as well and there there's two reasons why this i think is quite relevant ",
        "3": "the first is people say context that you know the context really matters and in the african continent we do need to recognize that it's one thing to talk about technological disruption in the fourth industrial revolution in the developed world but we do need to relate it to to us the second reason this is actually relevant is when i've in the past spoken about the fourth industrial revolution people often the question i get the most often probably is brian you're talking about the fourth industrial revolution we can't even get the second and third industrial revolutions right shouldn't we focus on the second industrial revolution before talking about the fourth and the short answer to that question is we have to do it all at the same time we have to do it in parallel because if we wait for to get the second industrial revolution the world will have moved on and we'll be left behind but the relevance applies that at a business level as well because when i was in business there were a lot of people saying brian just focus on ",
        "4": "getting the basics right i was in telcom for a long time and those of you that were with me and in this industry at that time no we had a lot of basics we had to get right but that doesn't mean you can't think about building the future as well you have to do it at the same time and i think that confronts many organizations today yes we have to get the basics right we have to deliver the numbers we have to deliver the business of today but we have to create the future and build the business of tomorrow there's another slide by way of context just to set this up um that says how can you talk about technological disruption when brian the biggest disruption the world has seen for the last half century covert has happened and the way i respond to that is to say well actually there's this metaphor that i'm sure you've all heard of the boiling frog let me just repeat it for those of you to for to unpack it the story goes if you take a frog and throw it into a pot of boiling water it will jump out because the shock in the ",
        "5": "temperature difference will cause it to react and jump out and it will be okay but if you take a frog and you put it in a pot of cold water and bring the pot slowly to the boil because the frog is cold blooded it will not notice the temperature change it will not jump out and it will boil to death covert disruption is a bit like taking our businesses and throwing them into the pot of boiling water and our businesses all responded we responded profoundly and dramatically and most people were surprised at the way that business could respond to covert and has been very painful but most businesses have survived some have even thrived tech disruption is a bit like taking our businesses and putting them in the pot of cold water and bringing it slowly to the boil because it is a pervasive persistent powerful change in our environment and if we don't respond we are like the frog that is at risk of boiling to death or this was say dying our businesses are at the risk of dying ",
        "6": "as this pot of technological change gradually boils and raises its its temperature and i'm going to make in the next half hour this very profound sort of provocative statement that says tech disruption is actually more powerful and more disruptive than covert has been and in fact that it is the biggest driving force of social economic and business change throughout human history that's a pretty provocative bold statement to make so let me tell you how i'm going to unpack that the first is how has technology affected society and the economy more importantly it's one thing to know it has how does it how does it do this what are the mechanisms then we'll relate that there's a lot of three three-letter acronyms going around today like nec and ran and all this i'm going to introduce you to a new one it's the tep a techno-economic paradigm and how does the fifth techno economic ",
        "7": "paradigm and 5g help us think about the future and then it's a case of saying with that background what is the actual opportunity for 5g in south africa and africa and finally very briefly how we're going to respond so without further ado let's talk about technology the economy and society and we all know the narrative of the fourth industrial revolution by now what we don't all know is the japanese narrative society 5.0 and as it often the case japanese cultures take a longer term view of history or eastern cultures generally and the society 5.0 narrative starts with society one the hunting society we then learned to domesticate animals and cultivate crops and we became the agricultural society then with the invention of the guthenberg press which led to the dissemination of the knowledge the invention of the whole cotton mills the arkwright ",
        "8": "mill the spinning jenny steam engines we got the industrial society which for those of you that know the fourth industrial revolution narrative that corresponds to the first and then second industrial revolutions and then we got electronics telecommunications the transistor micro electronics computers and that gave rise to the information society which is of course the third industrial revolution and that brings us to today where we are on the cusp of what's called the cyber physical society with the blurring of the boundaries between what people do and what machines and technology does which is this fourth industrial revolution okay so so much for this quick lecture on the fourth industrial revolution what's important about this my anthropology colleagues adverts tell me we evolved to be modern human beings about 250 000 years ago it was about ten eight ten thousand ",
        "9": "years ago eight thousand bc that we learned to domesticate animals and cultivate crops it was about sixteen hundred for 14 75 precisely the guthenberg press but all the inventions that flowed from there sixteen hundred seventeen hundred it was really in the nineteen eighties that microelectronics and computers diffused into the world and that brings us to today so the first thing that's really important to notice about this is that this period of acceleration that these societies zone from us from 240 000 years to 10 000 years to 400 years to 40 years and the important thing for that that businesses need to recognize is we don't have the luxury of waiting generations to respond it's hugely unsettling it causes social stress and it causes organizational stress but our ability to respond is being challenged because of this acceleration of the rate of technological change but the other important thing about this which i'm going to unpack a bit more ",
        "10": "is i made the point that the transition from society one to two was due to our ability to cultivate crops and domesticate animals from society two to three it was the guthenberg press the spinning jenny arkwright's mill the steam engine from society three to society four telecommunications electronics the transistor microelectronics the computer society fought in society five artificial intelligence interior things pervasive connectivity and i could carry on so the point is it is that technology is actually the single biggest factor it's not the only factor it is the single biggest factor which triggers these changes in human history these fundamental ways of that humans have organized and conducted themselves and lived we even go so far as to define stages of pre-history by the tools and the technologies that people used from the stone age where we use stone tools when then we learn to to craft ",
        "11": "bronze into implements and tools and then we learn to forge iron and craft iron into tools so we even define the major periods of prehistory by the tools we use but let's get back to a little bit more recent history and there's a number of perspectives i'm going to skip over this quite fast because i want to make sure i've got time for the substance so we've got these various narratives but there's others so uh an american historian by the name of lewis mumford he said technology he's actually a sociologist technology he says has shaped human history fundamentally in three ages of human history since what the year 1000 where we learn to use wood and glass and water to actually that shaped the way we lived and then we learned to use coal and iron and industry and that shaped the way we lived and then we got electricity and self-standing machinery so that's that's that's another perspective of this far more recently a scholar called hilbert has said actually if you think ",
        "12": "about all these waves of change from a million years ago till 1500 1600 everything was focused on how we transform materials to do jobs that we need to do better then from 1600 to very recently it was about how we transform power to move from horsepower and manpower to water power steam power petrol hydrocar hydro carbon power electricity nuclear power and now it's about how we transform information and that's the iran there's economic substance to this a russian economist called kondratiev he came up with his theory of long waves which was taken further by schumpeter and more recent scholars as well which says economies move in cycles and the single biggest thing of course wars and other exogenous factors have a big influence but there's these economic cycles that have shaped the world and ",
        "13": "you can see on the side there the various ones of these but the one i want to focus on is the techno-economic paradigm which is probably the most credible theory of how technology changes society and i wanna unpack but perez and freeman and the likes of them they talk about these five techno-economic paradigms based on proper analysis of the data so let's talk about these these paradigms but what is you know we talk about this term technology revolution and we we know about the technology what's it take to be a revolution so it's not only the tech it transforms labor it transforms organizations it transforms society and it actually transforms international trade and locations of power and if we go through all the previous revolutions and look at those five factors and i'll make these slides available through through the guys at um in ec exxon we see that all of those criteria are met in terms of the ",
        "14": "industrial revolutions that we speak about now the question is it's one thing to say how technology is changing society let's look at it in the numbers and we see that incomes have risen during this technological era people are living longer poverty is falling infant mortality is falling fewer people are starving but yes of course the environment is stressed and by the way that's not new to the era of global climate change if you think back to the transition from hunter-gatherer to agriculture society we changed our environment if you think from the agrarian society through to industrial society we changed our environment and absolutely now we are changing our environment and we need to be very careful so the numbers show that it's not just some sort of conceptual thing we actually see it in the in the numbers that technological change is fundamentally changing the human condition and the way we live and ",
        "15": "it's actually changing business as well some of you will have probably seen a version of this slide if you think about the world's most valuable companies by market cap go back 20 years it was essentially a few petrochemical companies a bank a technology company a retailer fast forward five years to 2006 pretty much the same uh still one tech company fast forward another five years and we see pretty much the same we start seeing the rise of china in this we see apple as displaced microsoft and then suddenly for five years forward every single one of the world's five most valuable companies is a tech business and if we fast forward to to more recently yes saudi aramco came into the picture when it went public but the rest of tech companies and if you look at the next five you've still got facebook you have um alibaba you have 10 cent so seven of the ten the world's ten most valuable companies are tech businesses ",
        "16": "but it's not just the tech actually if we look at that amazon is it a tech business or is it a retailer is alphabet a tech business or a media company so it's actually the issues what these are all is they found new ways of organizing they're all platform businesses so what it is is it's a case of the world is changing and it's not only the tech it's the way we organize and the way we connect with the market that changes as well so it's one thing to say is that i've spent now ten minutes talking about technology has changed the world in one impatient important question is how does technology change the world because if we can figure out how it does change the world then we can think how we can respond in a constructive profitable way and that then brings me to this point about the fifth tech um techno-economic paradigm and how 5g fits into that so perez's says that these these five techno economic paradigms these are the common words so from the industrial revolution ",
        "17": "250 years ago to the current age of information and telecommunications and what she notes about each of these ages is yes there's some technological changes that trigger it she calls it a big bang i don't particularly like that word it's it's a trigger but that it's it's a whole range of new technologies that interact with each other and feed off each other and build each other so it's these clusters of interconnected innovation which then gives rise to new infrastructures and now that starts pointing us a little bit the first clue of where we're getting in terms of 5g because in each of these revolutions these new infrastructures that arise which drive and empower the full impact of this revolution how do these work i said i want to explain how it work very quickly so what you see is level of diffusion on the vertical axis time on the horizontal axis and it starts with the big bang whereas i prefer to use the ",
        "18": "word trigger which then leads to this eruption a bursting in of the technology into the world initially in a very small confined setting in its original industry but then it expands beyond that initial setting and you get this frenzy of growth and then this is called the installation period in the tep language which is followed by a deployment period and then you get the synergy where the world has learnt to appropriate this technology for social and economic benefit and then eventually the prospect for further productivity enhancement is is exhausted and that then the technology reached maturity and saturation but you'll notice this break there um at which point you're ready for the big bang you'll notice the break in the middle of this and what's interesting is every one of these five techno economic paradigms has had some bubble bursts you get the growth it builds a bubble the bubble bursts ",
        "19": "and the in and the world reorganizes and rejigs itself to recognize that the initial exuberance during frenzy needs to be moderated and so on and then you move into the proper synergy but it's the choices we make in terms of how we regulate how we socialize how we organize and appropriate the technology that will determine the actual potential application of that technology so that's how the the the sort of the mechanics behind it there are a few critical conditions that cause these great surges of economic development the first is new tools as we said this is these new combinations of new technologies the second very importantly is new organizations new ways of organizing to appropriate the technologies and for the extract value i showed you those platform business models that is an example in the current paradigm about how we've learned new ways of organizing to appropriate value and the third is new infrastructures ",
        "20": "which actually oil and enable the the techno-economic paradigm that we're in and there are three things driving that it's about clearly perceived and rapidly falling relative cost of these these clusters of innovations and we've seen for example in microelectronics the exponential reduction in cost we've seen it in bandwidth the exponentially falling price per u per unit of data the second and sorry it's also about unlimited availability and a clear potential i'm going to come back and say how that relates to 5g now but it's these three things together these surges of economic development as i've said is not just economic development it's a very fundamental change to the nature of work and changes to the fabric of society so that combination of new tools new organizations and new infrastructures truly does create revolutions that our organizations need to ",
        "21": "respond to so let's now relate this a little bit to 5g um the fifth tip that we're in uh the technologies are the internet telecommunicator i've spoken to this the ways of organizing platforms and networks distributed production knowledge productionization we've seen that and the new infrastructures global data networks global supply chains global financial networks as we think about this current the cyber physical society is it a fifth step or a sixth step the jury is out on that but at the moment where we are the technologies ar iot quantum computing blockchain i could carry on but what's really important is openness in the platforms and networks distributed intelligence not productionizing knowledge but productionizing intelligence codependence and self-cent moving from a ",
        "22": "self-centered way of thinking about the world to a more socially centred way and the new infrastructures universal connectivity digital identities universal transactional networks that everybody can transact and it's not clear what the equivalent intelligence infrastructures will be that that sort of work in progress so now when we think about 5g and particularly open 5g it is a key enabler of this openness it is a key enabler of this universal connectivity and that is where 5g open ram fits into the story let's also look at those other things i mentioned the three critical factors that the clearly perceived and rapidly falling cost we see that with you know five we know 5g has 10 times 100 times more capability than what's gone before and we see hugely falling device and system costs so that reduces the the cost of you the ",
        "23": "unit cost of production dramatically we are seeing spectrum becoming available and increa the coverage is is really starting to increase rapidly and the the use cases offer potential for this across industries not just the ones that it was initially contemplated so again we see um what 5g open ran offers is the tools and the fundamental building blocks to make this fifth techno economic paradigm a reality so let me ask you a question who are these people and what do they have in common besides the fact that the demographic is disturbingly similar to this room so it's interesting i mean the the two on the right give it away they are the people who two of the two of the many people who have learned to harness what's happening in this fifth or the sixth step the other two we know gordon who was a co-founder of of intel ",
        "24": "um and of course bill gates then we see john rockefeller and henry ford john rockefeller oil henry ford the car who really understood how to harness the fourth tip then we see andrew carnegie still and george westinghouse of the famous westinghouse industries who learned to harness the third tip and then cornelius vanderbilt who was a rail magnate and a shipping magnate and jp morgan we think of jp morgan as a financier which he was but he made his fortune out of the restructuring of the rail industry and factories and then of course the first step richard arkwright who sort of was one of the drivers of the first industrial revolution in the uk and nathan rothschild who also was a financier but he made his money out of investing in factories and mills so these were people who learned to harness these various techno economic ",
        "25": "paradigms and what they had was the ability to get through this this this understand this statement bill gates has said we always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will happen in the long term why is this because i think it resonates with most of us and the reason this is is we've seen how technological productivity actually develops it happens in these s curves the way we think human psychology is in in terms of our spatial psychology it's linear in terms of our time psychology it's linear so if i walk across the stage i take five equal steps or something and that's a linear process if it were if i was an exponential process my first step would be small then my next one would be quite big and then my next one would be enormous and then you get the picture right we don't think like that and the implication of this is there's a disconnect between the way we think about the future and the way the future plays out and that means that we tend to ",
        "26": "overestimate the change in the short term and we tend to underestimate the change in the long term and what this means is that those guys that i just showed you on the previous slide they actually didn't get disheartened here when the results they were thinking should be there but they were actually they didn't get disheartened but they saw the future they had the vision to understand the future and translate that into business objectives and business intelligence let's call it so we've seen that technology has changed the world we've seen how techno economic paradigm theory explains how it changes the world let's now quickly move into the opportunity for 5g and to start that i want to talk about three lessons from 3g because i think it's quite instructive firstly this is global mobile data usage and we see a very classic exponential trend ",
        "27": "but the interesting thing about this is we you or rolled out your networks from around 2002 to 2005. that's when you actually deployed your networks but there was no data usage you can see that on the chart then what happened is the iphone was launched in june 2007 in the us and suddenly we had a use case for 3g and it was after we found the use case that the demand picked up and then and then we saw truly exponential growth and exponential reduction in unit cost over that period so the first is it's only actually in many cases by the way i talk about these infrastructures of the techno-economic paradigms it is once the infrastructure is in place that people learn what the use cases are and how to harness that that infrastructure for the creation of economic value ",
        "28": "a second lesson let's um look at coverage so this the blue line shows the coverage of 5g networks of 3g networks and of course you get the same usage that's global coverage and what's very clear is there's this five-year lag between the time that usage happens and the economists sort of the accountants will often say guys i need a payback in 42 months i'm sorry i don't think you're going to get it for massive infrastructures i think 5g ram offers opportunity for earlier monetization but generally the lag between infrastructure deployment and infrastructure usage takes time and we need to just actually recognize the business case that we need to find a business case that acknowledges that the third lesson from 3g is could we actually have seen this coming this this ",
        "29": "exponential growth we built our networks here and we see the exponential growth there could we have seen it coming so these next few graphs are quite complicated so i'm going to explain them you see this that's this is exactly the same line on a logarithmic scale now the way to explain the next few charts is at the top you see the year now which the forecast was made you see the sources of the data and then as i build out the thing you'll see the the solid line is the actual data traffic and the dotted lines are the forecast and this was the original 2003 itu forecast okay let's build this data quickly so in 2011 the forecast um sorry let me let me start at the beginning in 2003 the itu said that's what that was the forecast for 3g data and you see it goes from about 0.1.15 exabytes a month to just under one exabyte per month what actually happened ",
        "30": "in 2005 we deployed the networks we started seeing some traffic but not much then in 2006 people updated their forecasts and said actually this is where we're heading and each year you'll see at the top we updated our forecasts of what actually happened in terms of actual mobile 3g data consumption through to about now and these these were the fourth in 2019 these were the forecasts of of data traffic what can we learn from this is that once we were in it our forecast these various dotted lines have been pretty accurate but the interesting thing is before the game we completely underestimated by a factor of 10 to 100 times the level of demand that would actually materialize and there this by the way to i i would think we are about the equivalent of here maybe here in terms of 5g now my sense is that we are we have got no ",
        "31": "idea what the actual data you use will be because before the game in the past we completely underestimated the opportunity so those are three lessons from 3g but let's get let's get practical because we you guys are practical people so how are we going to what we're going to use this for so we know many of you i mean you guys all know this the anticipated use cases for 5g enhanced mobile broadband ultra reliable low latency communications massive machine to machine type communications my senses we know we have a fairly good view of the first one we're still figuring out what we're really going to do with your ultra reliable low latency comms and mm tc it doesn't mean we haven't started figuring out but but so because it's a bit more certain let me focus on the ones that we've got a bit of a better site of and to do that let me focus firstly on ",
        "32": "this just the mobile data so when you look at the ericsson mobile subscriptions forecast this is what it looks like therefore cost goes up to 2027. i've expect i've extrapolated that um to 2030. and you might be looking at this saying hey brian that that top line is is almost flat going from 8.2 to 9.1 billion over a period of six years i mean that's like a keg of four percent that's not particularly exciting but what we really should be doing is that's the 5g subscriptions and the business case we really should be looking at is that one and you show that to any businessman they'll say that's a market i want to be in because we all what the what the theory shows us and practice is that growing market share in a flat market is really really hard ",
        "33": "two-thirds of all growth in firms comes from the growth of the sectors that they play in not through market share growth so you want to be playing in a sector that looks like that so i think that's the first thing with regard to it now that that's just that's that's essentially the traditional mobile market let's look at a different one the if we look at the way we deploying fiber in south africa and it will be pretty much the same across the rest of africa is the way the fiber operators are doing it is they prioritizing geographies they've got the the main metros the secondary metros etc etc etc and they're deploying them sequentially and you see the the demographic statistics and the sort of the middle road for forecasting fiber penetration um says that by 2028 you'll see the will have covered all of the priority one to five areas and probably about half of the priority ",
        "34": "six areas how does that translate and there's a high road in the low road which i'm not going to go through how does that translate into what fabric will actually cover and you're saying why is brian talking about fiber in a 5g conference so this the data's here you can see how we defined the various scenarios in terms of because it depends on the places you cover how much it costs you to deploy fiber how much it costs you to install in the cpe and the affordability that people are prepared to spend and what your uptake is there's all these variables and there's high roads and low roads but then the short answer is in the traditional markets you have to torture the data extremely hard to get to more than three million homes you know it was a guy called ronald cohe said if you torture the data long enough it will confess to anything the you you can't really torture the data to get to more than three million homes in our traditional markets yes there's the so-called mass market ",
        "35": "and you can see there's quite a lot of additional potential there and when you work through all this and you look at the distribution of homes in south africa so what you see on the horizontal axis is the density of homes per square kilometer and you see the income on the vertical axis and the number is the number of homes and you'll see in in the these places in south africa that number in the blacks are 11.7 million homes in that category and when we see the actual coverage of fiber you don't need to see the numbers but look at the heat map that's where that's where fiber will cover fiber will not cover where it's the it's in black and if we look at the percentage coverage you'll see it's hundred percent in some areas but naught percent elsewhere and the fact is even with the most optimistic assumptions this is you're not going to address the whole market with fiber so the point is yes some of it will be addressed with ftth ",
        "36": "there might even be an opportunity for various public wi-fi models yes there are some wireless last quarter mile solutions that can extend the fiber coverage and yes satellite and particularly the new satellite constellations might play a role but the real issue is to connect south africa and africa you cannot do it without 5g or 4g a 5g is what provides the fiber-like experience so to put that in numbers yes there's a fixed opportunity of three million homes and if you go into the lower income areas another one and a half million and maybe even some of the fixed wireless technologies can cover another four which is five eight and a half million but by then we have 18 million homes so what about the rest so that's a really important part of um the of the of the mix and the opportunity there is enormous let me very quickly go over the digital divide because i'm out of time the point of the digital divide is it's ",
        "37": "not just access when we think about the digital divide we tend to think is it available and can people afford it but there's a lot of evidence that says even once people it's available and affordable only about half of africans use it and even once they use it are we actually seeing economic social cultural and institutional benefits and avoiding the potential negatives so the digital divide is actually what the what academics now called a three-level digital divide if we look at coverage in south africa and usage so the various short lines represent 5g 4g and 3g coverage in south africa and this red line this one talks to usage so we're using it and we're pretty well covered by 3 and 4g so what's my story here the point is is that as good as a fiber connection and i think we would all agree it's not quite but most important is it translating to benefit for people i saw 80 percent of africans and south ",
        "38": "africans benefiting from the internet i don't think we can honestly say that that is the case and we need to be concerned because we don't we could have a virtuous cycle where digital access and usage and empowerment leads to more income education and employment and that in turn feeds back to digital access or we could have this vicious cycle where lack of digital access and empowerment leads to more unequal education income and employment and the end of downward spiral and we all know in south africa the risk of downward spirals in other areas so we we need to respond what's to be done i i need to get through this very quickly the point being is there's a lot of things we can do to improve access and we have done there's a lot of things we can and must do to improve usage and there's a lot of things that we can and must do to translate access and usage into benefit ",
