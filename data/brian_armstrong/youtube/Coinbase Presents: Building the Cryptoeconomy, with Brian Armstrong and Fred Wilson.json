        "0": "please join me in welcoming Bryan and Fred we've got a great conversation well thank you and thanks for everybody for coming and so what we're gonna do is I'm gonna tee up the conversation ask Bryan a few questions and then we're gonna start taking questions from the audience if you don't have questions then I'm gonna keep asking questions but I have a suspicion that you you got plenty of questions so we'll have a you know get it going and then hopefully we'll turn this into something super interactive Bryan we've got a lot of institutional customers here tonight and Sam just mentioned that custody past a billion dollars today or this week um why does institutional matter so much to coinbase yeah well you know a few years ago we we were just getting started as a business and coinbase really got started as a retail brokerage and we'd realized at a certain point that for this industry to mature and really grow we were gonna have to bring in the institutional money out there and I think like 90% of the money in the world is tied up in institution it's not just in ",
        "1": "institutions it's not just retail so we started to go talk to these customers or potential customers at that time and we said what are some of the things that you need and they really had a different set of requirements and we went about going at seeing if we could fulfill that right so for instance you know coinbase custody is a New York trust charter they needed a qualified custodian a place to store these crypto assets before they could keep their lp's money there that's the kind of thing that didn't really exist in crypto at that time and so like many things that we've done we decided to go out let's can we build like a really trusted piece of infrastructure in the space to start to draw more and more of this money in so that was really the genesis of it and I think as we've gotten going you know institutions have become a bigger and bigger part of our business we've started to enable features like OTC trading through coinbase custody where these large block trades are starting to happen and institutions have become I think 60% of our trading volume on coinbase Pro as ",
        "2": "well so these are a really key customer segments for us and I think we're just gonna keep investing more and more in it and how do you think about the interaction between custody Oh TC pro you know I mean is the idea that they should all kind of interact with each other and and have tight integration should be should you be able to truck trade right from you know assets that are in cold storage like how does that all work yeah so I think the market structure of crypto is sort of evolving where it actually is really beneficial to have these this separation a little bit like it has happened in the traditional financial system and it's really important that you know we have these custodians that are trusted and all they do is they focus on having the assets be secure you know we've seen so many breaches of security in this industry we've also seen scams you know and this is exactly the sort of thing like the Bernie Madoff thing you know if ",
        "3": "they had gone and done the diligence and called the custodians they would have found out that the assets aren't there and so that's why custodians are really important part of that market structure and then the exchanges and the brokerages these are all what we're seeing is really the foundational pieces of this next generation financial system come together and that's really what I think crypto is gonna be it's gonna it's gonna be this really new financial system that has all these kind of benefits some of the things we'll have counterparts to what it was in finance 1.0 which are sort of the early things that we're building and then there's gonna be some brand-new things too that probably the world has never seen so speaking of brand-new things coinbase is now allowing customers to steak on the Tasos blockchain and i assume that ultimately you will allow your customers to do these various you know kind of validation type things on multiple block chains that is actually something that doesn't map very cleanly into the ",
        "4": "traditional world of finance can you talk a little bit about you know how important that is to the institutional offering and how big of a deal you think that's going to be yeah so that's a great example staking is one of these things that a lot of our customers came to us and they said hey we need to get the best return on our money and our lp's money as fiduciaries and we're interested in this and we had built this cold storage system to store all of the crypto in coin based custody securely we can talk all about that if you want as well but one of the really cool innovations that we created there was that you can actually earn staking interest on funds that are stored entirely offline and if anybody's curious I can kind of get share a few details on that but that's a great example of a new thing that didn't really exist in traditional financial world some of the next things we're having customers come ask us about is voting and on chain governance and we're ",
        "5": "working right now to enable that for our institutional customers as well because a lot of them are telling us you know if we make an investment in this asset one way that we can be sure that the value of it goes up over time is we want to participate in the governance and help ensure that it's making good decisions on how to move forward so we're just to zoom out for a minute actually we think about this as in in the crypto economy there's kind of these nouns and verbs the nouns are you know institutions retail customers even BOTS and dapped and any kind of entity and the verbs are the way that they connect to each other so some of them are you know some of the verbs are buy and sell and send and receive those have been around a long time but we're seeing more and more new verbs come out like stake and vote ways that people and maybe spending crypto and like that's the that's gonna be the next generation of of crypto scrip those evolution is it's not just an asset class where people are investing in it and they're speculating oh that's a great way that got all of us here in the room and you know 50 million people in ",
        "6": "the world to have crypto the next step is going to be to connect all those people into this economic graph almost like a social graph but you know the verbs are the edges and the nouns are the nodes on the network so you touched on cold storage and security you know I've been around your company for a long time and and you know one thing that I've always appreciated is the focus on security and can you talk a little bit about like how you bake that into the DNA of the company and early on and and and how you know it has has been the case that coinbase has sort of led the market and then yeah so very early on I remember the company just had five or ten people or so and we realized that we needed to take a lot of this these funds offline and that was like really the first generation of our cold ",
        "7": "storage system we're now on the fourth generation and I remember back in those days I was just calling a bunch of people who are now in the industry you know Zucco from Z cash I think I saw Brian Lackey somewhere he's a security expert I was like you remember I was calling you in San Francisco like Samir's secret sharing work and all the I was asking him all these crazy questions so the you know the first version of it was pretty simple we just had to get the majority the funds offline but now we're on you know generation four of this architecture and we've contemplated all kinds of disasters and things that could go wrong in the world so anything from natural disasters that you know disabled all of California or to you know people being losing losing information forgetting it you know unpleasant scenarios that you could probably envision solar flares that erase all the electronic data in the world you know we've contemplated a lot of interesting solutions here so ",
        "8": "today you know the offline funds that we keep they're really split up amongst in these secured data centers all over the world and we have this data just encrypted offline with HSMs that can bring it back online and there's no you know small group of people in the world myself included who can who can do this it's a consensus mechanism where you know say any five of the ten pieces around the world or needed to come together so that's been a huge first step is get a lot of this offline and use that as a guarantee in the real world the next thing we did was we went out and got a cybercrime insurance policy so we were the first crypto company to do that and to this day I think we have the most robust cybercrime insurance policy it covers things like not only hacking by external individuals but also an internal theft you know lost to bugs and accidents and things like that and then the third thing we do is we actually hired a lot of firms to come and try to break into coinbase and steal crypto and then tell us how ",
        "9": "they did or did not do it or if they were unable to do it and they do all kinds of things these are called you know Red Team drills for those who aren't in the security community so sometimes you will have people come pose as employees interviewing or candidates interviewing at coinbase and they'll come and you know in the middle tonight they're like plugging in thumb drives and trying to break into developer laptops and you know we run these rehearsals several times a year to try to learn where we have vulnerabilities in our system and we've really architected it now in a way where we kind of assumed that at any given time one or more developer laptops have been compromised if you look at a lot of the hacks that have happened out there in the industry a lot of them boil down to malware and you know infecting developer machines and they use that to escalate privileges to elsewhere and eventually run off with money so we've kind of built our the code that you know really stores money like our hot wallet on the server it's designed and it assumes that any one or more developer laptops could be compromised at any time ",
        "10": "and the funds are still safe got it well let's let's open it up for questions if if there aren't any I can keep asking all night long but I suspect that all of you have some things that are on your mind and you want to ask about you know a lot of it we can talk about all the challenges crypt I mean cryptos facing and security challenges it's also usability you know scalability volatility in particular the security side I mean one thing that we're trying to do is just enable a lot of this technology we've built making it available to third parties through api's and you know almost like AWS for crypto or something like that I think that would help a lot of companies get off the ground so they don't have to rebuild that from scratch you know think technologies like HSM hardware security modules that are starting to appear in ",
        "11": "cloud solutions those are those go a long way as well but it's just like anyone to like if you don't know how to use it it's not effective you know anybody who's in the cybersecurity community right now I think has really good job security they're there in short demand and you know everybody is scared to death what advice would you give to the decentralized application world that's just getting off the ground because I think frankly the user experience is horrible yeah from the software engineering shop consensus that builds these in five seconds yeah well consensus has built a lot of really amazing apps some with really good usability so you're you're right in the middle of this as well so the question yeah was how about how do we get better usability in these apps especially the decentralized ones of user control to wallets and actually ",
        "12": "coinbase is playing in this space too with coinbase wallet we've we've been encountering a lot of these challenges as well you know a couple thoughts one is that I think the whole space needs better usability and one way I've give given a certain book to a lot of product managers on our team Bryce is here somewhere I think I just gave him this book like last week but it's called don't make me think by Steve Krug that's one of the classic books on usability and it just puts you in this mindset of a user experiencing your product for the first time and and you know don't make him think like why is that icon that way I wonder what'll happen if I click it it's like if you're making him think you've already lost the game that's one thought I think the other big thing you know if there's one thing that could make user-controlled wallets really take off it's that you know it's the forgotten password issue where if you lose your password you've lost your funds or I guess in another alternative or version of it is if you lose your device and some of the recovery ",
        "13": "solutions there that we're all experimenting with as an industry like encrypted backups in like Google Cloud or social recovery where you know five of your friends yeah those are all or just ensuring people are signed in through multiple devices I mean those are all things where we can start to educate the world about how to how to use those I do think for a long time you know institutions just to bring it back to the topic of today aren't gonna want to kind of roll the dice on something like that so I do think centralized third parties are you know very necessary for a while but both are gonna grow enormously over time you ",
        "14": "say it's just so I want to clarify so we make sure Brian answers the question that you intended to answer institutions would be institutional investors yeah so there are I think of it like two ends of the spectrum but they're really kind of all one group just along along a spectrum so there are institutions that are really crypto forward or crypto first institutions and the sorts of things they ask us about are you know ",
        "15": "often these more cutting-edge things that Fred alluded to like staking and voting and are we supporting this new asset that they really want to trade so those are the questions that we get from them and then you know on the other side of the spectrum maybe a more traditional institution like like an endowment or pension fund or you know asset manager they might ask more about you know our stock to audit or the New York trust charter and the qualified custodian status and can you help us ensure that we don't get a qualified opinion with PwC on our financial return or our audits so you know but what's interesting is that their questions are starting to have more and more overlap because right after they check the box on you know sock to they're like oh yeah I do do you have staking so I think the industry there's a lot of overlap and institutions and what they're wanting and we're really just working as hard as we can to hear those requests and build them yeah I mean as a coin based director I'll just say that one of the ",
        "16": "things that has impressed me about this company is their ability to actually do both of those things at the same time to do the things that are required to support you know sophisticated institutions and also continue to execute at the cutting edge of crypto and the tech in crypto and I think that's why they've established their position in the marketplace is that you know they have have built and resourced the company to do both of those things and that that's unique in my view actually before we move on incredible isn't can I ask you a question yes you can put you in the hot seat okay so I remember back in 2012 you know I was a software engineer all by myself kind of thinking about a company that might start and I remember reading some of your blog posts around that time I think it was late 2012 you know I'll be friends a very famous blog if you haven't read it and I remember you posting about Bitcoin and you said something like I know everyone you ",
        "17": "know everybody thinks this is a scam or whatever but I think this is a big deal and people should be paying more attention to this and I can feel it my bones or something like that and at that moment I had a little light will go off to my head which was man if I ever started a company I want to raise money from this guy he he seems like he's he's he's contrarian but he's not afraid to say what he thinks that was a very unpopular opinion at that time and now most VCS are you know it's the other way they're knocking on our door instead of me knocking on 50 doors and getting 50 noes so I guess my question for you and you saw this with the internet and all these things how do you how do you do that as an investor like what when you're looking at some new thing that's happening you know how do you make up your mind that this is gonna be something interesting well I think a couple couple things I try to do one is I try to always force myself to think about what the next thing is gonna be as opposed to what the current thing is ",
        "18": "going to be because it's relatively easy to get caught up in the current thing you know companies that are growing super quickly and going public and and all those things or they're excited those are exciting things but they're not the next thing right and so if you if you don't kind of force yourself to say what's out there on the horizon what what what is what is that gonna be then then you you you you will just kind of continue to spend your time and energy focused on the same things everybody else's so one is just like making it a point every single day to try to force yourself out there and then the second thing is to have like some basic kind of pattern recognition or just like some way to kind of tell oh this is gonna be big and and the thing that that Bitcoin had that reminded me of the Internet was that it was this decentralized thing ",
        "19": "that that didn't have like a didn't have an owner at the core of it right like when when I first found out about the internet back in the early 90s I was like it owns it and it was like well nobody owns that it's like this this network this decentralized network and you know people explained to me it was designed this way by the Defense Department and so that it couldn't be you know taken out you know there was no centralized thing to take it out and I always kind of like that always kind of stuck at me like wow but that was the central design paradigm to create the resiliency and it also turned out to be important in a lot of other ways when bit King Bitcoin came along and I was like it was explained to me that you know here's a way to create money and lots of other important things without a central you know entity I was like that's important like I didn't really even it wasn't even much more than that sometimes it's better I think just keep things simple right and like ",
        "20": "my partner Albert was like yeah but you know do you understand how the consensus mechanism works no not really you know well do you understand how the inflation model works no not really you know and he was like kind of beating me up a little bit about that and I was like but here's what I can tell you like this is gonna be a big [ __ ] deal like we need to invest in this thing so you got to get over your [ __ ] and we got to figure out how to invest in it actually that's one thing I love about your style is that you don't over complicate things I remember like five years ago I called you on the phone I was like really torn up about whether I should hire this particular person I don't remember who it was at this point but I was like giving you all these reasons why I should in all these reasons why I shouldn't and you you just kind of pause and you were like you probably need to remember this you were just like Brian do you want to work with this person and I was like part of me was mad oh that's his only advice like god dammit you know but then I thought about it I was like that's actually the most important ",
        "21": "question and then I knew the answer instantly I like I like your ability to make it some that's how it went about finding a partner when we started USV that was my number one rule is like I can't be a partner with somebody that I that I don't enjoy working with right and so I just kept looking around until I found somebody I mean it was also important that they could do a lot of other things but that was my number one rule and and I still think in hiring it's the number like you know this person gonna get along with others and me yeah okay that was a cool trip down memory lane sorry alright here we go when you first read what sir that conversation was like what your vision was at the time well I'll tell a story and then Brian can can talk about how he decided we were the right ones I met Brian when he was at Y Combinator in the summer of 2012 and Paul Graham had asked me to come in and do something called ",
        "22": "office hours where I met with 16 founding teams over the course of four hours you do the math that's every 15 minutes and and I walked out of there in a little bit of a like a daze because 16 pitches in four hours a lot of pitches and you got to be the thing you have to be in that moment you have to be in it with each and every team yeah be listening you got to be poking like as if you're not like then what the book you're doing right so I walk out and Paul Graham's at the door and he's like so what do you think and I was like there was just one company that I really liked coinbase and he's like coinbase and I said yeah and he says you know you're the first venture capitalist to like you know pick that one and I said yeah I just think this bitcoin thing's gonna be big and I love Brian and it's just like if he ever raises money like I want to invest in that company so it really like even back before they even wanted to raise money I raised my hand and said you know picked me and then of ",
        "23": "course he did so you have to talk about why you picked me yeah so probably six months after that we were thinking about doing our Series A and you know went out did a pitch pitch pitch pitch all over Sand Hill Road and we only got we got one party that that was interested they sent us a term sheet it wasn't a very good term sheet it not only did it have like every bad term like liquidation preference and everything in it it also included the right to fire me as CEO if they weren't happy with my performance in the next year or something like that and so that wasn't very encouraging and then and then I was like man this this fundraising thing is tough luckily we got a second term sheet from from Fred Wilson and this actually influenced my negotiation style later in life which was you didn't set up like some people send a term sheet and they put all these owners terms because they're kind of bracketing the negotiation and there's gonna be this war of attrition where you finally end up in the middle somewhere Fred just sent me like good terms it was ",
        "24": "like everything is very entrepreneurial entrepreneur friendly I think we had like one back and forth and you raised the price a little bit and then we just done it was we were done and so I've actually used that later in negotiation which is if I really want to do something I just send them like a good offer on the first one I don't try to you know set them up for some long negotiation so that was that was how we get the deal done and I think the other thing that I like to do is I like to not have any like exclusivity or exploding off or anything I like to just say like here it is you know call me in a week call me in a month come in a year if you want to do a deal in these terms I'll do it shop it to everybody up and down Sound Hill Road if you can find a better deal and you think they're a better person the thing I found about that is that it it's like it's it's very in a way it's a little arrogant because it's very confident it's like I think you're ultimately gonna choose us but it also it doesn't it doesn't like express ",
        "25": "any desperation either right like it says to the entrepreneur there's a pretty confident investor and you know they're not worried about whether I take a week or a month to figure this thing out I also think like it is you know we're sitting here six plus years after you know we made that decision - you made the decision to let us invest and we made the decision to invest so it seems to be kind of weird that you would give somebody an exploding offer like you have to take this offer in the next 24 hours as a way to get into what's a six-year relationship probably going to be a lot longer than that so this is sort of my philosophy about these things yeah I wish it was more common all right one more question all right who has one alright say ",
        "26": "cutting-edge innovative projects yeah so you know we're gonna keep adding more more assets for retailer institutional and let me just share how I think about that broadly so number one let's start with institutions so institutions should be able to you know custody any asset they want really and that's gonna be the most permissive that's where you're gonna see the most assets available on coinbase as our chief legal officer explained one time to a regulator who's visiting because institutions should be able to custody a ham sandwich if they want to so you know consumers we also by the way we have like accredited investors who trade on pro you know they're they're probably gonna see fewer ",
        "27": "assets but still the vast majority of them basically anything that's not you know a scam or something like that and then on consumer you're gonna see fewer assets because there are a lot of consumer protection laws that are in place for a good reason but you know you're we are gonna continue to list more more assets there as well so here here's the shift in my mind when crypto started off you know it was really just Bitcoin and then we later added another one another one and there was one model of the world which was you know we're only gonna put this small set of curated assets on coinbase and we're gonna be sort of our arbiters of good taste if you will and that was almost like you know Yahoo and the very early days of the internet they tried to like list all the good websites like right on their homepage but quickly it became this world where there was millions of web pages and then billions of web pages and what's what's happened is that we're now in a world where we should not be the arbiters of good taste we should just be agnostic and and letting our customers trade anything that's not a scam and what we're going to do to ",
        "28": "inform our customers is create these asset pages there's there's should be at some point you know ratings or reviews and things like that so you know it's like if you go to Amazon there might be some product that has two out of five stars and you can decide to buy it or not but everything is listed there or similarly if you go to Google you know if it's not not every webpage on the Internet is there it's not a complete search index but the best ones are gonna be listed first or have the best ratings and that's the world I think we're moving to encrypt oh yeah so we'll we'll wrap up with that if any of you are thinking about becoming a customer of coinbase custody we would love to speak with you anybody you here with a coinbase name tag or sam we'd be happy to talk to you and help you get set up in the world of Chris on-boarded a bunch of our new funds and it was really simple I was shocked how easy it was so I was prepared to go through the kind of pain in the butt that go I go through when I ",
        "29": "open account at JPMorgan Chase and coinbase was a hell of a lot easier than that so well done thank you enjoy yourself [Applause] "
