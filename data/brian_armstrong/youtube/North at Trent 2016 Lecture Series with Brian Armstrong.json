        "1": "career which I thought maybe was just going to be a couple of years in Bogota Colombia and as it turned out we've been away 10 of the last 11 years in Colombia London uh service in Afghanistan for a year I took a gap year in my traveling um then we went back to Ottawa and then we've been in Reykjavik Iceland for the last three and a half years um my dad grew up in a farm in Manitoba I just called dolphin to sorting off to Brandon um finished high school worked at Eaton's for a year and then joined the RCMP so did his training in Regina um and did his first posting in Surrey BC which he didn't like at all it was a big city I think and was far away from the Prairies I didn't really care for it and volunteered to go up to Alexander Fjord for this three-year stint in the middle of nowhere in the Arctic he had never been ",
        "2": "North so made this through your commitment and was there for three solid years never getting out while getting out I guess was going to alert or um Chris Fjord and they went to um also over in Greenland uh to the Greenland I think once or twice so he was there with another RCP and then there were two special constables both into it and their families were were there as well and they had multiple children [Music] the time so he he ended up spending time there and then he moved around the north uh he was posted in strangely enough in Pine Point when the mine sort of first opened in around 60 or 63 64. then was in Fort Smith for a resolution and then the other places that I was when I was born so I spent to see his entire career ",
        "3": "in the north and anyway these images were um they were originally the the reason for the mounties being there was a kind of a sovereignty exercise they were at the time I guess worried about a lot of the Greenland uh you know what we're coming over uh mostly in the in the winter in the spring they had built some Turf houses uh there um and anyway they're worried about the Danish flag being you know poked in this Tundra and uh and so is a sovereignty exercise they had two RCMP and these special constables out there to basically tell them you know you can stay and take out citizenship or or or go home so that's what he did for three years I think they had a fair bit of time on their hands and so he took a lot of photos when he was there um but uh also as kind of established a relationship with the the the in your special constables and their families while they were there so I'll just um ",
        "4": "yeah start going through some of these uh these photos and see how far how far we get if you've got any questions just let me know unfortunately the I was in a bit of a um a rush when I was putting these together they're they're sort of clumped in a bit of an order but they're a little bit scattered as well not uh not perfectly sequenced um uh I was like I said I was trying to get my dad's thoughts and get this done before his condition deteriorated too much and so this is uh this is where we have so the this settlement itself was very small it was only a few buildings the other SNP had a a house that they lived in the two Indian families had a house and then it was sort of a shed and then a another storage area um the they came up from uh I think it ",
        "5": "was from Montreal on the labrador uh took the ship up and uh and they would just get a shipment uh once a year in the summertime all of their well there wasn't any fresh produce uh all the frozen meat and canned goods and flour and other stuff they would get yeah in the summertime and basically have to store it and live off that uh all year um so the ship would come off in the summertime obviously when there was no uh no ice um and they'd unload all the supplies so that was so they have to get them they're running off generators so they have to get all their their oil and basically everything everything they needed to survive for the year so this is the this is it um the few uh the the two buildings where they left and then a couple of sheds they did have a couple of boats ",
        "6": "um that they could go up and and obviously they just had dog teams and sleds in the wintertime to get around um in the summertime they the Inuit families would uh take some time off and just go and and Camp basically in tents with the families just to get time away from I think my dad and the other guy that was there and live off the off the land a bit and so that was uh well that that's the part of the two families that were there just with your chance set up and doing a bit of summer summer camping on the land this is part of the uh the barge and just bringing in the the supplies for the winter and for some reason they've got their red surges um I think ",
        "7": "they must have [Music] um yeah I think it was probably a photo op I think of whoever was coming in the ship wanted to have them in that uniform [Music] um for that and then yeah the the lava that came up I think a couple of helicopters on it uh um [Music] there's another close-up later on with people in it yeah [Music] this is just a breakup in this ring right you say we're Alexander Fjord yes elsewhere just in case um okay [Laughter] ",
        "8": "[Music] uh this is uh the two special constables that were there when uh them when he was there so they had a small boat like this to go ahead and um the the um they got all of their meat and stuff uh at the one time of the year and then there was this big sort of freezer that was dug into the ground uh that's how they kept everything that they needed Frozen for the for the year and it was probably crossed out there anyway so it was uh they didn't need to elected freezers to uh to do that um and they did a fair bit of hunting um in the summertime because they needed ",
        "9": "food for the dogs they didn't eat any of the local meat um the the internet obviously did but uh they had all their groceries and stuff that they needed so all of they just needed meat in the wintertime to feed the the dog teams and make sure they were kept alive so that's uh you'll see some photos coming up of the Hunts that they went on mostly for walrus and seal um these are our turf Huts that the uh I think you can see too in this photo one here and the one I think they were about two or three of them that the Greenland Inuit would uh built uh and uh used when they when they came over uh to uh to hunt and uh [Music] deficiency ",
        "10": "that's another picture there it's very similar to we're in uh we're in Iceland right now and uh you can see the same construction they've got the Vikings uh have left some of these turfs structures that they close this and it's uh it's so fascinating to see the simulators between that between these and what's uh what's actually nice and Drew now there's another photo [Music] oh this is yeah this is so the landscape [Music] these are the two inner special constables and the the uh the non-diversional guys the uh his I think Pete Sims through which uh they sort of they didn't come and go at the same time the the SMP officers was a bit of overlap so um there were two different guys in in in the camp at the time my dad was there ",
        "11": "for his three-year stint okay yeah so this um this is one of those senior RCMP who would obviously come up for a business so he's in full uniform so I think my dad and uh instincts were in the research for that business um they didn't wear that very often obviously they probably only were once a year I'm sure [Music] so that's actually uh yeah that's that's Alexander fjord and it was a glacier that came came down very close to uh to where they were they didn't have uh they just got their water basically from the from the glacier and then off from that [Music] there's a um you can see there's a a serial number there that's I guess they're uh [Music] ",
        "12": "thank you sidewalks connecting the the houses and painted a bunch of stones white uh connecting them which I'm not sure does that helpful in the winter time obviously but I guess it was looked pretty in the summer and then they used this was their radio frequency uh so if the plane was flying over something they could be in contact with with them um they're getting communication with them if they wanted to from but the two houses who what were their two houses uh one was for the for my dad and the other guy that was there and then the other house was for the Inuit family which must have been rather cramped because they each had at least four kids and so there was yeah probably at least a dozen people living in the other homes so just when your father's coming in I mean there's there's lots of stories from the the previous decades and other RCMP posts of RCMP the obviously you died after posting right there's a graveyard in Devon Island in one of his ",
        "13": "riflesmith discharge during a wall of our time there's dangers did your dad have any conception really of how isolated and you know something were to happen to him it would be really hard for him to get evacuated did we all talk about that at all no I don't think it really considers because I had I had the same so we were just going over these last week when I saw him again and um I mean I knew there were there were families there and there were small kids but I didn't realize how many babies were actually born there when he was there and I said well how did that work you said well the two wives just helped each other during their pregnancies and and uh and he was always there during the pregnancy not to hell but just I don't know in case um and I said well what if something happened if there was a problem with the baby or the mother and she said well they would have died because there was no way of getting them in or out or getting any help in if something went wrong so I don't know if it's one of the pictures ",
        "14": "we'll see but there was something about him having to learn some basic Dentistry [Music] manual because someone had an abscess tooth or something had to be yeah and he does it I mean there's some shots here of him giving vaccinations to uh to some of the kids as well just they would bring in some some medicine in the summertime and then they were basically responsible for giving the kids the vaccinations they needed yeah um this may sound stupid but like I'm amazed that these are in color yeah so was I and if it's like it's not you know like grainy it's really good color it's not like you know when you look back at Old family photos I mean was was photography something that your father did before he went up or he just kind of lucked into busy processing the film when he was out there yeah I think so they had a they had a dark room uh set up in the limited ",
        "15": "space they had um I didn't really consider my damage from a photographer at all um growing up but we've got some that's the thing I knew this stuff has been in the trunk forever we've got some family photos that he has slides of that a large part of those I haven't actually seen although if they'll get around to doing that now that I've started this uh project [Music] um uh but yeah I was I was struck by the uh the quality of the the images um when I when I first started uh looking at them um I mean he they've been in these old cartridge for years and then sort of a few years ago he started he thought it would be easier if he started putting him into these the old carousels um with the old projectors and stuff and I was just like oh my God that's such a waste of time we need to have these digitized um because then you can look on the TV and the computer whatever so thankfully um I was able to sort of steal the slides without him knowing them and just ",
        "16": "get them digitized together um and uh so yeah it's it's uh it's it's great to have them like this but he he learned that those skills yeah he learned them there because you didn't have them anyone out there like that he had a fair bit of uh time on his hands YouTube videos depending on what the atmosphere is doing yeah very much so I think they were able to to radio um you know some of it's too late and some of the closer uh spots and have a chat every once in a while it was it could be voice not just more I'm sorry it could do voice not just Morse code yeah awesome oh uh yeah so they had um there were ",
        "17": "I think they each yeah each Russian team member had their own dog team and then each of the special constables had their own dog team so there were a lot of dogs to feed which necessitations a lot of hunting in the summer to get steel and walrus for uh for them um this I think was just a a tourist who flew in uh during the the summer period which it didn't happen very often I don't think um but I was also talking to my dad about because they did hunt a lot of walrus and I'm like well what did you do with all of the ivory like all the tests you must have you said one of the one of the guys was uh was a Carver and so he he's got this cribbage board um that's that's made out of a an ivory test from a walrus and I said well but you were hunting walrus all the time for dog food I said what did you do with all the rest he said that they used to people that would come in from this either South Canada or whatever they were just sort of you know ",
        "18": "traded for alcohol or or whatever they needed basically or whatever they were short of um uh and uh sort of barter uh brought it that way yeah so that's a picture of the uh the pathways uh connecting the buildings it's right I love what your dad said because I was here seeing aside like that and then you talked about whitewashing yeah and I loved and I asked him why and I loved it because he said this a lot it was something to do yeah uh oh sorry just a quick question about the previous slide you mentioned the video visits were visitors were obviously according to frequent um I know at some decisions for yourself larger stations they were actually those scientists coming up to do more than research it was a station too small to facilitate that even if they were bringing around here yeah I mean there's I mean there's no place for them to stay and they had the communication and it was just wasn't particularly agency to get in and out of it so yeah it's been ",
        "19": "to a lot of time um yeah and that's uh that's just another shot from just after the lift where they had all their supplies delivered it just took a while to sort everything through and find a place to store this stuff for the for the winter this is uh yeah one of them just from from one of the uh the Hunts they're just not going to have tea um and curve up what they need from from the animal not quite sure if this is a seal or walrus yet um I think I'm happier walrus um but like yeah like I said the in the Inuit we're using a lot uh of the animal either for their own conception or for uh obviously for the for the for the dogs um ",
        "20": "[Music] so that it has a smaller boat that you already saw and then this was the larger boat that they used to go on kind of longer excursions although I think those were rather infrequences as well um they didn't do a lot of uh of overnights on the on the boat according to my dad uh it was mostly uh used to uh to help them with hunting to visit the the special consoles when they were camping on the land um yeah I think so I don't think I don't think they mentioned very far actually when they were going saying their summer camps oh um growing up my my dad always had this um thing hanging in the uh ",
        "21": "in the garage or wherever you normally in the garage and it was a walrus penis which was rather large and long and that was the one that was taken out of uh anyway apparently they had to dry out and the one that we had that's drying out for most of my life I finished in various parts that the places that we lived in so that's what that is another picture of them hunting thank you and yeah often so they would just set up anchor and uh and then um you know guys would uh try and find the best place to to hunt and find the seals get their uh binoculars and Telescope to see what was ",
        "22": "there how to get on and off the boat oh that's the actually that's a fish with the glacier that uh that comes down right close to uh Pacific Camp you can see that yeah the house is on the right hand side there [Music] um they obviously had to cook for themselves so my I guess my dad aren't too big from his mom um and uh this was just some cakes and stuff that they were cooking he sported the early hipster look no I don't think that there's a picture I think in this batch that uh he was shaving off his uh his beard and he normally I never knew him to have a beard growing up um so I don't think this lasted the entire three years that he was there [Music] um my dad was much of a pet person ",
        "23": "growing up but then you know now I see that they end up seeing these photos of these puppies and and the dogs uh in the house which you grew up on a farm and the dogs are never allowed in the pets are never allowed in the house and all of a sudden he's out there and the little puppies are running around and lying all over the place and on the couch and I was like really there's a photo of the glacier again [Music] that's picture from the hunt [Music] um they at Christmas time they always had the uh the two you know families over for dinner they have the a drop at Christmas time where they would drop them a Christmas tree and a turkey and some mail I think and usually a bit of alcohol that was well packaged that ",
        "24": "wouldn't uh get damaged on the drop and uh and then my dad was also saying that his his mom I think they got to talk to them occasionally I think over over the over the radio and so his mom would get the Aegis of the kids and the clothing sizes without the wives and stuff and then send up clothes at Christmas time and gifts and games and stuff for the kids so they would all uh get together and get dressed up and and come over for uh for Christmas dinner people all in one hand yeah in this match [Music] in the wintertime I think that was uh my dad's dog uh because they each have their own team so they had a lead dog which uh after three years when he left he had to shoot ",
        "25": "because the the dog wouldn't a day you know and be able to lead the team with with the new guy coming in so it was it was uh it was definitely his talk so unfortunately when he left the dog had to go [Music] that were there did some trapping in the wintertime um partly to so these are these are foxes that they would trap and collect the pelts and then they would think they would sort of do up a shipment and it would go down to Greece Fjord where there was a little Co-op and they would get some money just so that it would be able to have a bit of spending money and it was a little store that my dad and the other guy sort of ran and could if they needed to sell them tobacco and and some food stuff that sort of thing did your dad not say that um they weren't supposed to hunt that ",
        "26": "they did or trade hers but they also yeah they also did yeah I think they did a little bit as well Brian yeah what was the relationship with the special constables were they uh I mean because it sounds like the government or the RCMP was provisioning your dad and whoever was partnered there with him but they weren't necessarily provisioning this special constant I think they were as well for okay for some things but probably not for but not for to match back home yeah yeah exactly yes those sorts of things so this is uh yeah The Advocates uh when they got the certainly Christmas my my dad's mum and probably the other guys as well to send up some games and coloring books and different sorts of stuff so that this was all uh new and interesting for the for the kids did you see I know it's really interesting were these kids they were just dressed up for Christmas did they normally dress in dresses and ",
        "27": "shirts like this or yeah juicy I don't think so yeah so this would be just the drop for that year yeah yeah uh this was uh this wasn't Christmas dinner because um they must have got two turkeys maybe one for Christmas and one for New Year um so this was just the dinner for the two of them uh not the big dinner that they're having with uh yeah but they were big pies and and have those pictures aren't related so when they were out they would come across different uh artifacts uh stuff and so a lot of the stuff they would they would collect and then try and document uh some of the stuff they just put back where it was other stuff depending on the nature of it I think some of the stuff got sent south ",
        "28": "to down to Ottawa for uh for collection just depending on what it was without you like Greenland uh anyone you think or would that be a very old skeleton yeah I'm not sure [Music] that's a police plane on skis um I was able to come in the in the winter time and they just use the oil the empty oil barrels to sort of make a little Runway um right oh sorry just a question about school sir I'm assuming that's probably not an Alexander pure no but the previous one is did they have to stop you know straight no flatten out the uh the ice strip at all or does this they ",
        "29": "just Landing kind of held your sculpture on a fairly flat spot yeah essentially okay it didn't have a name equipment there to do anything [Music] um this [Music] no there's another there's another radar station here we go yeah I think that's where the system there's not that many aerial photos because he didn't get a chance to go up into plane very often um but there are a few it's brand one before was that um there's a scenario of where um but is there Community there on the side I'm not sure it's gonna be fast it looks like it wouldn't have happened that could be truly yeah maybe ",
        "30": "because there's a lot of cancer Tower um this there's a few pictures here this is um increase Fjord the you guys he was Bob pilot he was in the RCMP my dad knew each other for quick sometime we were actually yelling at together and so this was the little Trading Store um where a lot of the the first and stuff the foxes would uh they came there and then they got the the internet got some uh some money to you know buy some stuff there or buy some tobacco and stuff back in Alexander Fury yeah yeah so they would run this I guess but I I presumed I thought he said that it was the RCMP that actually um because the stranger that has the the nwt uh coat of arms or something ",
        "31": "absolutely obviously think it was that's my dad and uh they came across a herd of musk ox and I think they were probably Fighting by the definitely this little one was from right by the the plane when they landed and got separated from the rest of the herd so he uh um that's so cute that's one of my favorite photos anyway they managed to to get the little guy back into the to the rest of the the herd and give it back to us over there and then this this was taken obviously a different time uh in the summer but um I'm not I was trying to find it for my dad where this was actually taken because it's very uh it's very green um and there's a lot of shrubs and Bush around um ",
        "32": "yeah I mean it's either in Greenland or it's just an uh a different part of southern part of elsmore Island because there's definitely not a big fish station was there a lot of interaction with animals where your dad was staying like they could buy a lot or like did the bus stops like on birds or groups I don't think they had muskox around them but they definitely had polar bear and wolves with them yeah I think so there's um they shot one of them um because they can obviously use the the hide and uh and some of the other parts of the animal uh this is back in uh to the before in Eureka um more there yeah ",
        "33": "um who's who really knows who's gonna explain this better than me what was more there was a cheap no fit one of the first no-filled airlines right they might become that after me it was one of the small Northern big operators that they got Merchant who was it in the camp Pacific Dimension yeah it got a real boost of the building of the new line in the 50s late 50s and the resupply operations civilian contracted by the military and obviously my RCP would be survived that too but I remember in the 70s and 80s uh as a kid flying to Yellowknife from Ottawa and we would fly by Edmonton and one of the options to fly north was Ward air and they were 737s so it was a competitive Airline owned by one man uh Max Ward isn't it yeah um and I think he's he's sold the company ",
        "34": "again it was a bush pilot okay he came in with the left and my dad yeah this is the picture of them all up and their uh the documents they were trying to find a different way to get a not sure where they were going exactly but to get around this rather large uh Glacier there were some photos I don't actually think they're in this bunch of boats and I'm actually trying to hold these sleds up with uh and and get the the dogs up this rather steep uh to get on top of it uh to get where they needed to go um yeah this is the picture I described earlier we should give you the vaccinations to the to the kids um [Music] that's there's two kinds of harnesses in the Arctic right but so this was the uh yeah the West ",
        "35": "yeah no trees yeah [Music] that's the dogs just taking a break they're out hunting right now you can see on the right here this is uh what they used to it's just a wide canvas basically with wood so they would hide behind that so that the seals couldn't see them when they popped their heads up um and then uh [Music] the dogs having a break and the grandson is the tea probably a cigarette [Music] uh this shot is uh uh the Inuit Hunters I guess this they had a polar bear had come across and um they didn't see the that it had any little ones uh so the polar bearing getting getting shot ",
        "36": "um and then it was only after the fact they realized that there was a couple of Cups uh that was with it um this is America and that's one of the uh [Music] so it's basically got the tracks in the back and then there's two skis on the on the front to uh to steer [Music] death of a lot of times when it was they were somewhere with the dog teams and there was planes and stuff like that they'd sort of have to line up the dog teams in a certain way in front of the plane so the pilots want the picture tape and with the plane in the background and the dog team and everything so it's a bit of a process um I don't think my dad was much of a sewer but I think Sims did some sewing they had a singer up there and that's the radio equipment um in the background that they use for all their Communications ",
        "37": "[Music] that's a laundry day um put it dry yes thank you but if it froze they could eat it with a sticky it'll still come out here this is just uh they had a bit of a workshop where they could do some work on the sleds because they had different uh tracks for uh for different times of the year um this is uh another police plane on on skis when they went to tulip they would the RCP would come for HP play and fly them to Bradley they go across and I think he said he never went across or around uh on land no ",
        "38": "this was a visit by some senior sap so there's a uh all in uniform oh yeah this is one of the uh so this is a photo of the the Greenland Inuit dress very differently than the uh the north of Canada so they would come over from a green address very well the yes they're wearing our polar bear skin and then the the jackets are are caribou [Music] would they buy that I guess they would buy that the Fabrics these ones are the the Inuit uh the Canadians from Alexander versus just useful in Syria and all geckoed and fur but but whether with the Canadians oh I think the women the women made them I thought maybe that they were sort of RCMP issue but um ",
        "39": "but uh yeah the women made the coats for uh there's another picture coming up where where there's a woman from uh from Greenland and she's got a more traditional for on the in inside uh and the skin on the other side which is for colder colder temperatures yeah yes that's another another part of the Greenland uh Inuit and their dog teams when they would come over [Music] this was a this was probably part of the Christmas drop I think whether it gets a tree and some food and then something to drink over the holidays ",
        "40": "that's just the dog keeps taking a rest and they were trying to get around this big Glacier that's one of the few pictures actually they've got with um an igloo I'm just I don't think they traveled that much they're that far in the wintertime so they uh would you say once or twice a year they would they would do a longer a longer trip yeah yeah uh Overland degrees or or even as far as Resolute I followed yeah I think I think so when the time I talked to Daddy was crying so even the the special Constable especially walk for like 10 days at a time to buy dogs live to get yeah um this uh the um and they're quite social when they're when the green lenders would come over it's not like they were ",
        "41": "told to go make Camp somewhere else they were invited in and uh and uh with ft and uh something to eat and and uh socialize the vaccinations continue [Music] results this is one of the boats just doing some maintenance and repairs so they did that themselves too yeah everything basically yeah yeah wow this is obviously Springtime because they're dressed rather oh and then this is not my dad um this is Tim's uh thought it was quite warm out apparently he was quite sick after uh it got credit gold um a couple days after this photo was ",
        "42": "taken [Music] and they've just offers a bite to eat and some tea [Music] setting up camp [Music] us a photo from the poster were they looking for Walters there yeah I think they were looking for uh your dad said that the the enemy preferred using the telescope um rather than the officers of the prcp would have the room and then again you can see the count just down there it's really really interesting when you were looking at them maybe timing for a while was just to underscore that we're talking to death the amount of time and you mentioned invested in the dogs like ",
        "43": "hunting but like it was like the dogs ruled right there were 40 dogs and a couple of 15 people and and everything because that's their own techno that's the only technology in the winter everything revolves around keeping the dogs happy and you can see all this yeah it's all for the dogs yeah [Music] that that one before Ryan was uh where they're packing up the boat that's to go off to their summer camp yeah and so they're just uh so yeah but there's still Lots but I guess not so much landed especially in the morning uh the ice but yeah I was taking about three or so yeah that was clearly the interval but not the uh the RCMP boat so they had their own [Music] store where they would come for supplies sugar flour and all the basics and tobacco [Music] ",
        "44": "and they obviously rolled their own cigarettes at that time so they had their papers and headed to close to I think some of the basics these I think are um our big whale whale boats um that semester summer summer camp [Music] this is the fresh water that we get from the uh from the glacier [Music] I think that's another shot of the labrador just from a different angle the summer [Music] ",
        "45": "is that American driver I think on the right yeah these are both oh sorry yeah on the ends those are Americans so they'll start knocking on that yeah that's why they're dressed up I guess they're a lot right of Americans coming and going and after reviews of tourists Americans and greenlanders RCMP yeah military yeah I think we look forward to the summer obviously for many reasons the warmth and the Sun but also I think they've just got a lot more visitors um there are a lot of the pictures the officers um are doing a lot of things together with the community so I was just curious as to what the language barrier was and how they communicate when they're going on a hunt together or when they're trying to get things done together how do they communicate with each other yeah I think was a bit of a struggle because um uh my dad I think during that time learned to speak a little bit of an ",
        "46": "ineptitude when he was there and these the special constables were posted in I think both of them came from Baffin Island maybe not exactly sure which Community State it came from and so they would have had a bit of English obviously dealing with the RCMP from the jobs there but I'm not sure they're family members their wives and their kids spoke any English at all so uh yeah I think the communication was a bit of a challenge at times yeah [Music] thank you he's definitely married um there [Laughter] oh that's that little boat yeah yeah okay they had to Anchor it out and the ice ",
        "47": "do you want to just go back for a second but doesn't the bow drop down yeah transport yeah pulling stuff from the ship that's the labrador again so I think that one that you showed before if it had the number at the front I think that was the American okay all right um and then they they uh this is just they're they're taking uh one of the special counselves wife and the kids uh out to the ship just for fun a little Excursion for them to get off the land and get up in the air and so pops so there they would obviously Harvest all the the seals this is walrus here and then load it all into the to the boat and then have to unload it when they go back to the camp and then store ",
        "48": "it uh store for the winter for the dogs [Music] [Music] unfortunately did a lot of reading um and I can sort of see that now because he reads a lot now that he's older and obviously he spent a lot of time um he sent me the day that there was this woman from the this American woman that used to send up books and stuff like that for them to read throughout the um oh my gosh yeah I can't remember what her connection was to the place to the people that served in the isolated station yeah it was uh she gave us a sense of how much material he got available to you oh I don't think ",
        "49": "there was that much you don't see any pictures of like bookshelves full of books and the whole library or anything oh yes obviously his dog um lead of his of his teeth Brian it's great just package that photo again I noticed uh some of the well I know it's not all chronological but his shots he had obviously government issued shoes on and I'm assuming those are non-government-ish yeah so did the like with the wives have made those for them yeah and they face I guess basically found that they were better quality than what they did yeah [Music] oh yeah so that's another these and so these are things that they uh they hide behind uh when they're hunting uh ceiling walls University ",
        "50": "[Music] [Music] there's probably at least a dozen or fifteen seals that they've uh oh God what's thinking because you were saying that they just pop their heads out of the water and they shoot them behind away how do they actually get them out of the water like open sides of the wall right it's not that must only float for a bit yeah I think it had to be quick [Music] a long Harpoon with a long string on it so then they just go over and attach that and then drag them under the hole I assumed they would stray far from the group of dogs because dogs can't really be around yeah leave them with a little bit of a distance yeah so they could sometimes help to sniff out the seal holes so they were useful to have noses ",
        "51": "and then I just said interesting between a walrus which obviously weighs a lot one person even one really strong man there's a few stories of sort of superhuman legendary you know even if you could haul them out one but for the most part we're in a ceiling you could take out as the individual but it'll take a seal but walrus is definitely a team effort so having to collaborate it's pretty cheap so how how often did they go on hunts and how long would like that haul of 15-ish feels hold them over I'm not sure I think it's how to hold them over it's a provisioning for the winter and they probably would need multiple excursions yeah 40 dogs need 15 seals yeah [Music] okay ",
        "52": "yeah this was um I'm not sure how far it was from uh it was a one day it was the first night when they were when they would yeah they could stop there if they would stop and sleep there and sleep there if they needed so it wasn't bad no any bases North right towards a murder right yeah uh this was a great we were trying to read the the writing but it was it's going to be this weird font and we started to decipher what was actually on the cross I have a feeling it's more more to Canadian because the first letters of the second names look like Sven s-v-e-r and I just can't read the rest so here came basically being embarrassing to the religion thing ",
        "53": "will just whenever you feel like because we feel some little questions and then okay why don't we just finish [Music] remarkable fluorescent sponsor whether it's wonderful there's only been another 30 photos I've got here so you can a lot of them are just shots like this with them I would say hunting and boats while they could in the summertime very short summer that they had [Music] these are a couple uh yeah that's these are the old camps sort of rock uh ",
        "54": "houses that the Inuit had had made in the summertime the Greenland yeah the green Landing [Music] installed [Music] it's another walrus sentence the bird [Music] that's sort of at the bottom of the the glacier in the summertime there's a lot quicker eating [Music] that's crazy yeah it's really cool that's a bit of a picture though [Music] ",
        "55": "Christmas [Music] all right oh yeah so um he ended up he ended up getting uh five polar bear hides uh while he was up there um I think mostly just to heat cap one for himself and then he gave one to one H2 is brothers and his sister and then I think he sold one to a to a friend so he's got a home um and then we actually have one in uh in high school his sister passed away a few years ago and her husband didn't want it and their kids didn't want it so I was like well it's no point being a box and storage somewhere and so I asked if I could buy it off him so he gave it to me so now do they last well oh yeah okay yeah it's pretty good yeah these are actually wolves um but I mean the polar bear but the polar bear itself ",
        "56": "yeah I mean it's it's uh I suppose it's a little bit uh the golden era is perfectly white as you think they are [Music] and I was saying earlier that in in 1400 of these pictures that he took there's probably only three pictures of sunsets and I was just like I said why can't you take why wouldn't you take more I mean the sunsets in the in the Arctic in the north they're spectacular he says well once you've seen one you know what's the big deal I'm just like really you've got all this time in your hand that photo before the colorful one um I think it's fascinating to think the best taken without any filters of any kind yeah that's just the color it was you know these days you can do that on Instagram in about five seconds at the time ",
        "57": "yes another Christmas the polar bears is that the mouse is working with a ton of training about you know what Wildlife was like up there when they were ascends up there so I can only imagine what your dad would have been like to see his first polar bear and yeah and even if you were scared of polar bears these are ferocious bears and uh that have been a really neat encounter uh this is another sort of uh yeah the uh the Greenland didn't come over and so this is um one of the women that Stuart Stockwood earlier just with the um here the the polar bear is the first on the outside where it's uh on the road um they have the pepper on the inside yeah it's interesting because when you think of you always hear that okay the greenlandic uh uh Inuit had were had better education than the Canadian native when they were you know more you know not more integrated but more sort of brought into you know ",
        "58": "um sort of society um in a sense that that uh you know they were probably more sort of progressive years taught to believe yeah um it's interesting that the Canadian Inuit from what we've seen are the ones that are actually more interest more in materials that would have been you know part of it at least bought at the store or Hudson State company and these guys look like they're just still dressing right from from the land right I think there's real differences between the north and south and east and west of Greenland we have I don't know if you've seen a Canadian film uh called vanishing point it was done a couple of years ago we presented an Arctic Circle actually a few years ago at the regular Film Festival by Canadians uh who traced the the Heritage connection between people or what they call polar Eskimos actually which are in the north of Greenland which would would be these ones that come from around Thule uh in Greenland um because they were dying out about a ",
        "59": "hundred years ago and um uh following visions of a shaman uh I needed a Hunting Party left from Southern Baffin and went to the north and discovered these people and helped repopulate them over a generation and then brought back a lot of uh of DNA but uh but different sort of customs and traditions and some things they do more in return in nutritional ways and and some things the the Canadian with you it's interesting to see that but but I I know what you mean uh and the when you see Community pictures of the south of Greenland um around nuke and the communities itself it looks almost like a day nutrition Village once you get past the ubanok in like disco Bay it's very traditional Stark differences yeah I also think it's interesting too when you look at ",
        "60": "[Music] where she takes off her exterior clothing she's wearing what does seem to be definitely Western guard yeah so I also think too it's the when you're traveling in the land and you're going out just like the RCMP constables are doing right they're adopting the dress that's best suited to condition which is going to be the traditional dress baby but then when you're heading out you see the classics of Western Arctic Monkeys where you can pick there that would be for around home so if you're fancy Sunday wear so it's quite interesting but I'm not sure that's what I love about these there's different ways of reading them and interpreting and thinking about them but again for coming over from Greenland it may be entirely Progressive fitting to say of course we understand the Western culture we interact with too late oh my god when you're traveling long distances you'd be silly to wear anything other than polar bear Stitch yeah that's all in context ",
        "61": "[Music] he's really into it oh so yeah so this is on to the polar bear jackets yeah you know the sweaters clearly yeah from boilers [Music] it's uh oh yeah these so they did some as I mentioned earlier they did some tracking of fox and stuff so this uh they're just going to collect uh what was in the traps and bring them home the bottom of skin them that was white boxes that were really the big deal if you look you know even today at the RFD Council logo it's a white box right it's just that I like species [Music] those shots over the boat another one of the terabytes that you've already seen [Music] ",
        "62": "system loading on the planes nope and the last last photo was one of a narwhal [Music] um so one of the one of the special gospels that was up there um they had I don't think narwhals were that common I don't think they got hunted that many of them but he does my dad does have a full narwhal Tusk at home and then um he's sort of got a half of one and then um the you know attached uh uh a bone on as a handle it's like a walking cane almost um that's been carved around the handle stuff that's really um really quite nice yeah so that's that's it [Applause] "
