        "0": "you wrote a blog post that's really interesting in uh september 2020 titled coinbase is a mission focused company like what we're talking about so one interesting thing you said in that blog post is that we're not going to be distracted by sort of activism within the company that's not related to the mission of the company now that's a rare thing for a company to state for companies here at the state especially in this climate um can you first of all describe in a little more detail what you meant uh did you receive blowback for this i definitely received some blowback but yeah i'll describe what i meant and um if you want to talk about how it came to that too we can talk about that but what i meant is that um there's a lot of companies right now including tech companies but not exclusively where um ",
        "1": "you know i think like great companies they have an important mission they're trying to do something really good for the world and unfortunately they're getting a little distracted from that at times because of employee activism that is causing the company to basically jump into whatever the current thing is and try to help is like the positive interpretation you know the negative interpretation would be to virtue signal and my view is that this is actually kind of destructive to um this is largely an american company phenomenon by the way i i i do worry that this is making america less competitive um even though i think of myself as kind of internationally minded but i you know i i'm a u.s citizen had a lot my whole life here so um when we put out this statement we had employees that were not in the u.s who were confused by it they were like why did brian need to say that you're just saying you're going to work focus on work at work that's what we were doing already yeah you know and there was certain pockets of the us certain cities all you know in particular where we had employees that ",
        "2": "um a very peculiar cultural phenomenon had evolved where um i think people really wanted the company they worked at to be you know uh almost acting like the government or something and like trying to solve the hardest societal issues and and how at least have an opinion on it if not contribute to the solution on almost everything um and for me i kind of uh you know i was it was a very uncomfortable situation for me as a ceo i'd never quite been in this situation where most the time when employees in the past were kind of asking me questions um they would be asking about like you know how do we make this product better like what do we do with this competitor what about this regulator and it got to a place around that time where most of the questions we were receiving were i think even about things not related to the company they were about broader societal issues like brian what's your stance on xyz controversial thing and you know it was i often like didn't have an opinion on ",
        "3": "these really hard questions right and um i didn't really i felt like it was distracting the company people internally were getting into fights a lot too like disagreeing with each other there was there was a thing where like the social slack internally was turning into social media almost with people putting in flame wars so and this culminated by the way with um a walkout that happened in the company we we we received like some demands from employees groups about various things and there was like basically an antagonistic thing with management and employ and i was like we're all on the same team here if you want to be antagonistic let's do it with somebody else outside the company you know that we're trying to improve the world on in that dimension so yeah eventually i was like okay the company is not aligned on this i just don't feel i don't like the job as ceo frankly like if if the job is to come in here every day and like have to squirm in front of like these the most difficult societal questions um i don't think i want to do that job so like either they're gonna have to go or i'm gonna have to go and i founded this company and i really ",
        "4": "believe in the mission so they're gonna have to go and what i realized was that um so i basically i made an exit package available to anybody who wasn't on board with this direction five percent of employees took it i got the company realigned towards this this mission we're all here to do work by the way people can they can go do anything like political or social activism outside of work it's totally fine like we all everybody has stuff like that um in their personal life but while at work we can also disagree at work by the way on the work you know this is not like a no disagreement culture like we should let's try to get the truth um but don't bring stuff into work that's just gonna create division make the workplace a refuge from division about all these crazy things and like we're all aligned here to work on the mission let's do that yeah that was really really really refreshing to hear so this is me speaking but there's a sense when companies take on these issues publicly from a ceo position or any anywhere else that it does seem to optimize for virtue signaling versus solving a ",
        "5": "particular problem because to solve a particular problem you really have to really put in a huge you have to hire a huge number you basically have to create a company within a company to take on a particular thing right uh but if you allow yourself to internally care about a particular issue you're basically pacifying some number of employee like making sure slack doesn't get out of hand and then you're doing this kind of from my perspective especially on issues that care about fake virtue signaling basically trying to understand what will make me look the best what would make the company look the best in this particular aspect and it just seems very shallow and it's optimizing for the wrong thing not for the solving of the problems yeah but for the making yourself look like the good guy and trying to then leverage that to say i'm the good guy in all situations and it's just it's it's the wrong thing and ",
        "6": "perhaps from your perspective as a ceo as a leader it's also creating division unnecessary division within people like they get yeah there's something about us we get extremely argumentative about certain topics they really bring out the emotion yeah and i think that probably as you were saying that emotion is even probably okay maybe productive when that emotion has to do with the mission of the company like you really care about those disagreements versus like something that has nothing to nothing to do with the particular with uh with increasing economic freedom uh using crypto yeah it's fascinating but it was so refreshing because it's rare why do you think that's a rare so you the city you're mentioning we could i mean there's a bunch of cities uh but you know san francisco is one such city when one when that culture and it's sad because san francisco is also ",
        "7": "the bay area is also the hub historically of some of the greatest innovation in human history yeah so that there's that tension how did that culture emerge there where like the innovation was done by people that are very mission driven you get a bunch of smart people together to solve a difficult problem they get uh maybe sometimes too much blinders on but they try to balance that and because it requires that focus to solve an actual problem and yet that's also the place where this culture emerged it's a fascinating human dynamic i don't know somebody will one day tell the history of of silicon valley not just the innovation but the social dynamics that occurred there anyway why do you think that's so rare well because people don't want to get attacked it's like super you don't want to get cancelled right it's super unpre comfortable you know nobody wants to be called a racist or whatever whatever you ",
        "8": "know people want to say on twitter so um get attacked yeah yeah i definitely got attacked i mean and i knew it i knew it would be controversial the only reason i did it frankly was that um i was kind of at my wit's end i was like well like i said earlier like the job the ceo job sucks like either i don't want to do it or they have to go and i'm going to make the company into something that i want and you know i spent i'd spent eight or nine years of my life at that point kind of building this thing i was like well i could go start another company but it takes a long time to get momentum with these things and you know coinbase is a very rare thing that happened in the world i feel very passionate about it so um yeah i'm not to go like i need to make this the company that i want to work at and what was really interesting was that there was such a huge outpouring of support so i knew that it would be controversial and i would get attacked and predictably you know there was some um some journalists and you know new york times and all these people who kind of like went and started writing hit pieces on on the company after shortly thereafter and they basically just call ",
        "9": "people who've left the company and like you know can get quotes on whatever they want and then they'll write a story so mainstream media i lost a lot of trust in mainstream media frankly after that and of course it's kind of become obvious since then that um most mainstream media is like hyper politicized at this point it's basically either super left or super right and it's not really that focused on um truth so that's that's kind of unfortunate um because i think journalism is actually like really important in society so that that whole thing got eroded in the us luckily there's sort of new media people like you um and a whole bunch of people did that blog post help that statement the the 95 people that remained is this still something you struggle with because there it's also a culture of the broader tech space okay so that was an interesting thing which was that so the 95 percent of people stayed i got a huge outpouring of support from people who said thank god you finally spoke up and said something because frankly ",
        "10": "it was making not a very fun place to work either and i realized that there is i think there was a i think is it the seam to lab has this blog post about the tyranny of the the one percent or something like that but there's basically a relatively small group one and five percent or something like that that is really upset about something it's not the majority of the company it's like five percent there's another 15 or something that are sympathetic to the cause they're they're actually somewhat suggestible they will go along with whatever because it sounds reasonable you know these are like real issues they're talking about it's not not to say that it's not real and they'll kind of get swept up in it but there's an 80 of the company that basically doesn't agree or just wants to get their work done without all this drama and or distraction and they're afraid to speak up because if they speak up they're afraid of being again called a racist like fired you know ostracized amongst their peers and so it did require um it to get to a bad enough place for me to finally say you know what i just i feel like i have to do this ",
        "11": "live through the short-term attacks of the press which ultimately was very freeing for me because now i don't really care and now i can actually just build the company that i want to build without like caring about that so and then what was cool was a lot of really great people reached out to the coinbase too after that and were like i you know i'm an early engineer at google or wherever and like this culture has gotten kind of messed up and like i want to work at a company that's willing to stand for that and so we've gotten a lot of good people come over basically what i realized and by the way are diversity numbers and all that stuff like people told me when i was drafting this post they're like don't post this you're like people underrepresented groups will never want to work at this company again and i was like i don't think that's true like i talked to like our erg groups and they're not telling me they care about this stuff that much they're telling me they just want to like be respected at work and do good work and contribute so my gut was telling me that that advice was wrong and like i can tell you a year a year after doing it like our diversity numbers are basically either the same or better in every category so that turned out to be false ",
        "12": "um look i i hate to be like like i'm you know polarizing on in either dimension here like i just want to get good work done and build good stuff with technology so you know um i think companies should just have like reasonable policies like you want to get rid of bias in hiring you want to attract great people from all different backgrounds like you know we have pledge percent we put one percent of company equity into a foundation like i hope we're able to do good stuff with that that's you know give back in some way but like the main the main message i guess for me is like the core the core mission the core work that we're doing on economic freedom and just all of our products are that is like the main value that we're contributing in the world like let's just do that more and hopefully we can get from 89 million verified users to a billion or whatever and then um i just think that's how we'll have the biggest impact it's it's tempting though it's so interesting how companies get tempted to to help yeah it's like and you step in and it's almost like a drug and then you can't ",
        "13": "you forget i mean like all of us in life doesn't have to be companies you get distracted yeah and maintaining focus like you're absolutely right the way for coinbase to add value to the world is just to maximize the mission that it's on not not other not other stuff and when you get wealthier more successful this becomes more and more tempting to just help out in some other shallow ways and it's fascinating and you just kind of brought that to light so it was very refreshing and it shouldn't be controversial to sort of focus on just getting stuff done well let me ask you i mean do you think that this it's all these things tied together there's like a general trend of like more censorship you know there's like more cancel culture um there's uh some of these like freedom values are kind of you know even like freezing people's accounts like the trucker thing that happened and it seems like there's a general trend of um more authoritarian you know uh policies there ",
        "14": "but do you think there are do you feel like the tide is turning on that like there's counter examples to it we've seen recently yeah i i think it's uh the last gasp of old way of doing things and so there's desperation and so on because to be fair it's kind of the internet which is where is the source of a lot of this where people have a voice is making the power centers of the world really nervous and so that's where that's coming from i think and and the internet is tricky it's weird it's full of bots yeah it's full of like misinformation of all kinds yeah full of large groups with conspiracy theories and so on uh and i mean misinformation broadly people are misusing the word misinformation they're just governments are just labeling random things with misinformation just to censor them but i just think it's just like a new world where the internet is really finally taking hold where there's billions of devices and everybody has a voice it's it's almost uh ",
        "15": "basically governments and powerful people are slightly losing hold of power and they're starting to freak out a little bit that's it anyway so and then once you have young people that are coming up now gain power i think will will rebalance everything and and then there's yeah like you said promising signs um that it's obvious that the majority of people want freedom and that means a lot of things that means economic freedom that means freedom to have a voice freedom to move around freedom to act in the way they you know without without reasonable sort of um limitations by people that don't have their best interests and i i gain more hope from just regular people that are fighting and like demanding the being able to have freedom of speech or more specifically sort of resisting ",
        "16": "crude overreach of government in the acts of censorship at least in the united states uh and hopefully that percolates out to the rest of the world that's struggling on a much more basic level where people are being put in prison for the words they say not just banned from twitter you "
