        "0": "Brian thank you so much for being here the CEO coinbase I think everybody wants you to explain a little bit about what this thing called Bitcoin is so we'll get there but first I wanted you to tell us about your journey because you started the company in 2012 you were an engineer at Airbnb you'd started a few things before that yep um but what was it back then before anybody knew what Bitcoin was that made you think this is an opportunity yeah well let me just zoom out for a minute to put you in the mindset I was in at that time so I had studied computer science and economics in school and I had taken a year to live abroad in Argentina which is a country that had gone through hyperinflation and then as you pointed out I joined Airbnb and there were a company that was moving money to 190 countries all over the world and so I sort of had a front row seat into the difficulty of integrating with the global financial system every country has kind of their own systems you have to integrate with with different fees and delays and so in December of 2010 I happened to read the ",
        "1": "Bitcoin white paper which was written by this mysterious person who nobody knows Satoshi Nakamoto and it immediately a real person I have no idea who he she or they are unfortunately but it definitely captured my imagination when I read it because it talked about how the whole the whole world could have this Universal currency that ran on the internet and I felt like it just kind of grabbed me and I felt like this is the most important thing I've read in like five years so I started going around to different meetups in San Francisco like they had these very early Bitcoin meetups and you might laugh at this but I remember thinking like oh my gosh I'm too late to the game because there was already like Bitcoin exchanges that were there and this was like the 2011 timeframe and I'd go to these meetups and like the room was half kind of brilliant computer scientists people and half just completely crazy people so kind of like online dating probably yes so in that environment I kind of started to tinker with a prototype on nights and weekends which eventually would become coinbase and so that was a little bit of the ",
        "2": "origin story you left Airbnb like pre-ipo super high for this thing called cryptocurrency yeah what is cryptocurrency serious a little crypto 101 because there are a lot of people in this room who are intrigued by it but don't know where to start right well cryptocurrency is just digital money so it's like money that you can send around the Internet and Bitcoin was this fundamentally a computer science breakthrough so it's solved this problem that had never been solved before which is that if I'm gonna send you a digital dollar how do I prove to you that I didn't also send a copy of the same thing to somebody else because in the digital world it's really easy to make copies of things like photos or any kind of digital content and so the only way people had solved it to date was they have trusted intermediaries like banks that sit between us and so they atomically debit and credit and account to make sure I didn't double spend it and Bitcoin came up with this brilliant ",
        "3": "solution which was it allowed me to send you a dollar and prove that I didn't send it to anybody else but we didn't have any intermediaries in the middle taking a fee or slowing things down and so it basically created this global version of cash or gold if you want to call it that that allowed anybody to transfer value to anybody else in the world trust lessly over this global network so it's basically supposed to be less hackable less fraudulent less risky but it almost seems to people who don't understand it that it's more of all of those things yeah well it's brand-new and so I mean just like cash that you have in your wallet people can come take your wallet and steal your crypto money as well but it does have some nice properties that are even better than you know traditional cash so for instance sending it over the Internet allows me to send it instantly anywhere in the world whereas you can't do that with cash you know in the physical world so there's a number of advantages but there's also as you pointed out a number of challenges ",
        "4": "to it becoming like a global currency so you got into Y Combinator you got backed by Union Square Ventures Anderson Horowitz a number of you know other investors Kevin Durant an investor and now you store twenty billion dollars in digital assets yeah it depends on the day the prices have been changing a lot but ten ten to 20 billion ish of customer crypto I think we're the largest custodian of crypto out there right now that we know of so basically in the beginning you were just offering the opportunity to buy and sell Bitcoin and today talk to us about the range of what you do sure well actually the very first product was I just thought there should be a hosted Bitcoin wallet kind of like my inspiration was something kind of like email with Gmail you know nobody wants to run their own email server and if you lose your computer you don't lose all your email it's sort in the cloud so I just made you know a hosted Bitcoin wallet something similar to that but a funny thing happened all these people were signing up for the product and they were like I liked the product but I ",
        "5": "don't have any Bitcoin to keep in the wallet so it would be nice if I could buy some and that was the nexus feature we launched was the easy way to buy and sell it and that became the first product that got mainstream adoption we've got about 25 million customers of that product now so going on from that we now have a number of products another one we launched is an exchange so it's kind of like you know if if coinbase is like the Charles Schwab or fidelity of crypto our exchange is kind of like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq of crypto so we did about 150 billion of crypto trading on that exchange in the last year and now we have other products coming out as well we have a custodian for institutions we have an asset management firm that creates these indexes index funds or ETFs kind of like you know the S&P 500 of crypto so you know our mission as a company is to create an open financial system for the world and one of the first things we need to do to make that happen is enable people over the world to get their fiat money and this is what we call it into and out of crypto money and sort of be like that bridge all over the world for ",
        "6": "people to get money into crypto and then once we do that we need to shift crypto into what I call the utility phase meaning let's have people actually start to use it in their daily lives for various goods and services and that's the next big challenge that we have which we can talk about if you want as well well so talk to us a little bit about the journey because as you were building the company I mean the market just took off I mean how many crypto currencies are there today thousands thousands and how many do you host on the platform so we only list five today because a lot of those things are brand new and higher risk some of them frankly are scams right and so what we've done is we've taken a very curated approach one of our goals is to build the product out there in the crypt of space that's the most trusted meaning it's secure and compliant and the easiest to use so that means that we're not trying to list everything under the Sun especially as new consumers are coming into this space and trying to understand what they should and shouldn't buy it's kind of like not every company can get listed on the New York Stock Exchange there are ",
        "7": "some minimum requirements before you can go public there so what's it been like for you I mean has it really been like being on a rocketship whatever that's like yeah I mean it's it's organized chaos right certainly for me as an entrepreneur it's been a crazy journey you know we now have about a thousand people at the company it's about six years old every year there's just like another thing to learn a new skill set you know whether it's like fundraising or learning how to manage teams more effectively or even now we have a number of offices around the world six or seven and so just communication across a global workforce and all these things I'm definitely learning on the fly so let's talk about the price Bitcoin peaked at 19,000 700 something dollars last December now it's below 6,000 today every day I feel like I'm reading a new story about Bitcoin hitting a new low is this the new normal like is this what the price of Bitcoin should be well the way I think about it is that this this technology is going ",
        "8": "through a series of bubbles and corrections right so we've actually been through about four or five of them now where Bitcoin made this big run-up in price and there was kind of irrational exuberance and then it corrected back you know 60 70 % and each time it does that it's at a new plateau and it's kind of matched the growth of the company right you know if you go back to 2012-13 when we started we had maybe five or five hundred people a day signing up and then at the next after the next bubble and correction we had like five thousand people a day signing up you know and now it's more like 50 dollars in a day signing up so this technology just like the Internet right remember that in 2001 the internet went through this crazy bubble where everybody's expectations were way ahead of the actual value and it crashed down but a lot of good companies got started in the trough as well which you know what companies like Facebook which later turned out the very big companies so the same thing is happening like people's expectations are all over the map but I think the real world adoption and usage is like pretty steadily increasing each year so ",
        "9": "if you want to start dabbling in cryptocurrency I mean where do you start I mean buying and starting a wallet is is one thing but obviously there are so many different options and there are as you mentioned a lot of people out there trying to make a quick buck yeah I mean so certainly the easiest way to get started crypto is just to own a little piece of it and you know your friends can send it to you you can go online and like ask for people to send you send you crypto though there's so many crypto evangelists out there that they'll they'll love it if you do that but once you own a little piece of the technology it helps you to understand it you can start to talk to people about it and then look for ways to use it in the future so what do you think about the risk factor here obviously the SEC has not been very positive on Bitcoin lately they've rejected a number of these Bitcoin ETFs there was a lot of optimism that regulators would get on board why is the SEC still not believe mmm I mean from my point of view actually the SEC has been pretty positive on it they've I ",
        "10": "don't expect them to kind of take some brand new technology and instantly bless it you know their job is to ensure there's a safe market out there that consumers aren't gonna get defrauded or anything so I think rightfully so they're looking at it was a lot of scrutiny especially as there's so many new coins coming out there that are you know of questionable value so from my point of view they've been very actually good to work with just helping the ones that are more established come out and the next big challenge we have working with them is we need to jointly define a standard for like what is an acceptable cryptocurrency how would you classify one as a security versus a commodity all those kind of questions Warren Buffett has called it rat poison squared at Jamie time and has called it a fraud are they wrong yes they're wrong I think and you know of course Jamie Dimon came back and corrected himself after that Canton look I think you know if you go back six years it was actually nine out of ten people who I talked to or crypto sceptics now it's getting harder and ",
        "11": "harder to find crypto sceptics there probably are still some out there but it's becoming contrarian to be equipped a skeptic instead of the other way around so I think just like all new technologies when they first come out people are skeptical and then they start to see real-world use cases and they get a little bit more excited so what is your perspective on i ciose it seems like there's a new initial coin offering every day whereby funds are raised unregulated and you've got a few investors who say I want to back this but there's no regulation around it how do you see icos evolving yeah I mean with my coin base hat on our job is just to be the most trusted and easiest to use products out there in the market and so we've taken a more cautious approach to looking at I SEOs we haven't really participated in anything in that area yet but with that being said I do think I SEOs are an important innovation in the world and the reason is that it's really difficult for people out there in the whole world to raise money for new ventures now here in Silicon Valley you ",
        "12": "know entrepreneurs like myself are lucky enough to have a network of people and we've been able to raise capital but if I didn't you know I just I went to school in Houston Texas right and I didn't know any angel investors they're the ones were there they were from oil and gas and if you went in there and you pitched them a new software product like cryptocurrency I think they might be very unlikely to invest so there and there's people over the world with even less opportunity right in many foreign countries so for them ICO is the ability to raise money from people all over the world who might send a little bit of crypto into this address on your computer as part of a crowdfunding project is a huge breakthrough and yes there's a lot of legal questions to work through there's a questions about quality on some of them but I expect the ico trend to continue in fact like this year in 2018 I think it's on track already to be 4x the size it was in 2017 and I cos have broken all the previous crowdfunding records out there so you've said coin bases objective is to be about trust and legitimacy not these sort of ",
        "13": "fly-by-night exchanges what is it that you're doing at coin base to make sure that you are the leader the brand leader in cryptocurrency and that you give you know all of this you know you see a huge opportunity here opportunity here a good name mm-hmm well the first thing is that we proactively with regulators right so not only in the US but we're operational in 33 countries and so we've always tried to be an educational resource proactively reach out to them whereas I think others in industry have kind of tried to fly under the radar right which is a totally different approach you know the second thing is around security like cybersecurity like storing this cryptocurrency is a really hard problem and there's all these hackers out there in the world who are trying to break into exchanges and steal crypto and so we've built a track record and reputation so far of being the most trusted at that which is why we have the deposits that I mentioned earlier and you know some of the things that we do we talk about publicly which is 99% of all those funds are stored entirely offline they're not connected to the ",
        "14": "Internet we have a series of key holders that are geographically distributed around the world that need to come together in some kind of consensus to move any of those funds and there's redundancy so you know pieces of it can be lost or forgotten and that kind of thing you know if you just take me away you can't you can't actually get access to the funds there's a group of people around the world that need to come to consensus so there's many things I can talk about we have insurance on it all these things but I think compliance and cyber security have been two of the biggest pieces that have helped us get that most trusted reputation something else that you are trying to be a leader on which I love is on diversity and we've all heard about the blockchain Bros and how the bit coin and crypto industry is sort of at risk of rewriting all of the wrongs that the tech industry has in being so underverse as it is what are you so first of all why did you decide to do that and what sort of progress are you seeing internally yeah so the reason why is that we're trying ",
        "15": "to build we have an ambitious mission and we're trying to build the best products and to do that we need to get the best people into the company right and you know talent you know this talent is everywhere but opportunity is not and so that's part of why it's important for me to to make a company that has this kind of inclusion so some of the things we've been doing on that front one of them is I created a top-level company objective which we review every month in front of the company around diversity inclusion and we have an okay are they call it you know objectives and key results yes in the valley lingo so that's one thing another thing you're setting targets for yourself yes okay for the company another thing that I've done is there's something called the Rooney rule which is part of the sourcing process where you you have a for us we set a goal for ourselves of sourcing at least three people for all VP and above positions from underrepresented backgrounds and the reason I did that was that I felt like bringing in leadership that was ",
        "16": "diverse would be a way to automatically attract talent under them to come into the organization so that was an important one you know the last thing that I that I started doing that I'll just mentioned is we we worked really hard to eliminate or at least try to reduce the amount of bias in hiring processes because there's always gonna be some but one way we did that was we created you know we started interviewing people based off of not culture fit or whatever that ambiguously means but I prefer culture Edition yeah yeah and so we started interviewing people based off of our values and our skills and we we're working to create a standardized set of questions so that you know each candidate will get asked ideally the same set of questions and there's a standard rubric of answers and things like that so you know working with people like Joelle Emerson and those folks has been and Ellen Powell has been really helpful to bring in some of those those ideas super important all right we're gonna start taking questions in a moment are you seeing progress like what are the results that you're seeing as a ",
        "17": "result of your efforts yeah so we've seen some positive results and obviously we have a long ways to go still as well but you know one thing is that actually a third of our leadership team is women now so that's a feel like a good start and actually a third of the company is women which is still not where we'd ideally be at 5050 but you know in fin tech that's above average so we're happy about that you know we did hire a head of diversity inclusion which is I think somewhat rare at our size company we're starting early on that and we've created some employee resource groups as well which are groups of employees who can come together and I think that's contributed positively to a culture where people feel included they can just do their best work and you know we have this kind of rule like if somebody is brilliant and they're jerk like it's an easy decision they don't get hired at coinbase so I think that's been a good outcome so far no brilliant jerks but no stupid ",
        "18": "questions either anybody have a question for Brian go ahead [Music] yeah so there's certainly a company or our countries all over the world that are taking a different look at cryptocurrency my general view of it is that most places in the free world they are adopting this technology they might want to you know they rightfully want to protect consumers as it's being adopted and introducing thoughtful regulation as a piece of that but they're certainly not anti crypto in fact the opposite ",
        "19": "there's many jurisdictions around the world that are seeking out crypto companies like coinbase we're receiving pitches you know where can we build our next office around the world because they recognize that this technology is a way to stay on the forefront of both finance and tech now there are going to be some countries in the world just like the Internet where you know it's restricted or it's filtered and I think crypto is gonna end up following a similar path to the Internet in that regard you know how China has the Great Firewall of China or North Korea has a private Internet right so I think there couldn't be an end up being countries like that and the citizens there will actually use VPNs and things like that to try to bypass those restrictions to get access to cryptocurrency it's been countries like Argentina or Venezuela where crypto just became the de facto you know currency and have saved like the economy why do you think it's so hard for some other ",
        "20": "countries to just realize the usefulness of that right so I think there are certainly country's going through economic crisis and I think there's pockets of people in those areas that are getting interested in cryptocurrency I I don't want to say that saved those countries that might be an exaggeration at this stage but I think there is certainly interest amongst those people in having stable currency where they have the highest pain point right and it's really terrible to see what's happening in places like Venezuela so you know one effort that I've started on the side is a nonprofit called give crypto org and what we're doing is trying to make small payments out to people in the world who are going through economic crisis crypto scheme is a very good way to get real-time small amounts of payments to people directly to in their hands so there's not an intermediary and then helping them exchange it to the local currency if they need to or do crypto decrypt it of transactions to buy whatever they need I think is a really important use case so I'm bullish on that in the next say three to five years I think you will see country's going ",
        "21": "through economic crisis where everybody has a smartphone and the Internet now they will suit you could see people organically adopting crypto as an alternative I feel like a lot of the crypto chat is always about kind of buying and selling can you give us a sense in America of real life like I'm paying for bread like what adoption rate is that and is it in certain major cities or who's doing that because I don't feel like I see that a lot yeah so you're absolutely right that the vast majority of usage today of crypto is in the investment phase right it's people buying selling it trading it speculating and in the u.s. I would say that's probably 90% of activity by the way investment let's call it roughly 10% of it to be real world usage and people are not using it necessarily in you know call it brick-and-mortar stores or like at Starbucks or something like that ",
        "22": "they're using it more like online so the early use cases are things like online crowdfunding there's people who are creating a bunch of games there's people creating new user-generated content sites kind of like you know reddit Twitter Facebook equivalents where instead of an upload or like button you actually transmit a small amount of value so people who are creating content that's useful to others they're actually earning money on this Universal currency of the Internet so those are the kinds of use cases along with the emerging market things that I talked about that I think will take off first and it's going to be people who have the highest pain point and it I think it'll be quite some time before you know you cross the street and go to Starbucks in the US and pay with crypto just because that you know the the financial system in the u.s. works pretty well for most consumers there's a higher pain point in other areas one more Oh Thank You Bryan does coinbase is it isn't required to ",
        "23": "report gains on portfolios of users in any of the countries right now so no that's actually something we've been working with the IRS on is we'd like to just issue 1099 statements just like any brokerage would to all of our customers and hopefully we'll have a solution with them shortly about the exact format that they will accept of that so that's what we're working on it with them we'll do one more here hey how you doing so are there any cryptocurrency either new or are already out there that really excites you as far as the usage it doesn't have to be a specific one but just you know what excites you about the usage of a particular coin yeah so you know I never want to give investment advice I always have to be careful here just from a regulatory point of view but there are a number of new tokens that we've announced that we're exploring at coin base you can go read read about those on our blog we mentioned a couple of them there so I'll restrict my comments to that just because I don't ",
        "24": "want to get in any trouble very careful okay I have a last question um what is next for crypto and let's separate crypto and blockchain yeah because they're two very different things with different potentials and some people say they don't see the potential in crypto but they see the potential for the blockchain what do you see okay so I mean first of all more of like a 100 101 answer so for anybody doesn't know I mean cryptocurrency is like digital money so people transfer it around to transfer value blockchain is kind of a broader concept than that and it's it's the technology underpinning crypto currencies like Bitcoin but you know it couldn't be also used for other things like private blockchains like a consortium of banks might come together as an alternative to Swift which is like a global you know settlement network between banks people are using blockchain for other kind of more you know theoretical things right now like governance or identity but my my rough assessment of it is that cryptocurrencies meaning like the public ",
        "25": "block chains are where we're gonna see a lot of the innovation or more of the innovation just like when the internet came there was like public internet which is where most the innovation happened and then there was private in Internet's or intranets and some companies use those and whatnot but most of the innovation was in the public Internet so I think the same thing will happen with crypto so is block doing going to change the Internet as we know it or is the internet simply going to evolve it is gonna change the Internet I mean the Internet when it was created there was a couple original sins if you will like if you talked to Marc Andreessen who created the first web browser what he says is that they made a few mistakes so one was they didn't build privacy into the Internet as a base level thing the other one was they didn't make payments native to the Internet and now years later this got invented so the Internet which is inherently global and decentralized and no country or company owns it now has a currency that is also ",
        "26": "global decentralized and no country or company owns it that's hugely powerful because previously the internet was mostly about transferring information now you can do information and value all right well luckily there's no pop quiz but hopefully we all learned something thank you so much Brian we'll keep watching [Applause] "
