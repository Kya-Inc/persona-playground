        "0": "so how you doing i'm doing very well thanks for having me no thank you for having me because i'm actually here in your offices which i love and there's clearly lots of creative things going on here which is very fun slowly coming together better than our last office which was a three-bedroom apartment that was packed full of people and had no decorations whatsoever well that's how all the best stories begin certainly in startups definitely yeah so not only are you running a startup but you're actually running a bitcoin company so how's that going so far it's been really good you know we were the first bitcoin company to kind of get a bank deal done in the us we made it really easy for people just to convert dollars into and out of bitcoin we tried to make it trusted and secure so we have insurance on the bitcoin that we're holding and that must be interesting yeah that's an interesting deal how do you ensure bitcoin well it was tough to explain it to people but um we actually have something called a cyber crime insurance policy so what so it covers i don't know why ",
        "1": "that's hilarious it like sounds like teenage mutant ninja turtles yeah it sounds like a movie should be made around that like a hacker movie or something but um yeah it covers all kinds of like the things that we the discussions we have sometimes are pretty intense about um you know like ukrainian hackers trying to break into our systems and how how would we deal with coercion and like you know duress keywords and things like that so it gets a little intense sometimes but luckily we haven't had to use any of those so what like what is the weirdest thing you've had to deal with like have you actually had to deal with these ukrainian hackers um i mean yes like there's people trying to steal bitcoin all the time all over the world yeah it's um it's a very attractive target and you know all all financial services are you know so far we've had an amazing track record as a company we're storing more bitcoin than any other company in the world that we know of um so we've invested a lot in security we've actually we actually stored 98 of it entirely offline and it's distributed in geographic geographically distributed in safe deposit boxes and ",
        "2": "we do something called key splitting which is like essentially we're splitting up the secret into a bunch of pieces and to restore it would require those to be rejoined oh my gosh i remember you know in the movies when like they have to launch the nuclear missiles and you have to put the key at the same time yeah it has to be it's always like kind of like that that's crazy so you had to invent a lot of things around security to start to store bitcoin securely yeah i can imagine especially because you guys just launched a new exchange we did so how's that going it's great so it's been out about a month um i think we're now the largest exchange in the u.s by volume and i think third largest in the world that's what i heard a high five thank you nice like king of bitcoin it sounds like well i wouldn't say that but we're doing well we're doing well which is okay i'll say it i said it we're trying to remain humble here i mean this is a very new space yeah um and we we're trying to help bitcoin overall grow not just like not for it to just be about coinbase but um certainly having a stable exchange in the u.s that um people can trust is going to be a great thing for the ",
        "3": "bitcoin ecosystem you know i've interviewed a few people in the bitcoin space and when i interview them i ask them to explain bitcoin in one sense do you think you can do that sure okay what is bitcoin so bitcoin is a global decentralized digital currency nice i did it in one sentence but you might have to ask like what does that even mean um so i mean my favorite analogy to explain bitcoin is email right so um think about email it works everywhere in the world and you can send an email in a couple seconds it's free the same thing you know that email has done for communication bitcoin is doing for money previously you know money was moved around by a series of proprietary payment methods in all in different countries all over the world so you know visa is an example of that the only company who can use the visa network is visa there's also western union and all these systems in various countries i have a visa do you have a visa sure yeah they're in everyone's pocket right right ",
        "4": "um but if you want i think you know so our goal is like coinbase will be on every phone you know as their wallet i think the the wallet is moving from you know your pocket to the phone that's like been a trend that's happening for a little while um but any com the beauty of it is that any company can send money on the bitcoin network it's not just coinbase now let's talk about the wallet sure so you're also a wallet so what does that mean for bitcoin like how how does the bitcoin wallet work yeah so i mean it's a little does it look like a normal wallet so it's it's electronic it's on your phone so instead of carrying it you know in your back pocket with you know um dollars or whatever yeah let's see what's in your wallet it's cutting it i mean i've got credit cards i've got everything an id normal stuff all the normal um but you know instead of isn't paper money like doesn't it seem kind of archaic oh yeah i never have it it's sort of but then i find myself trapped in certain situations you know well meaning what they don't accept anything else yeah on occasion like parking garages yeah or i ",
        "5": "don't know well it makes sense because um those have high fees right so there's actually a lot of places in san francisco that don't want to accept credit cards there's restaurants bars taxi drivers the reason is like they're paying two or three percent for that and they that's why they always want cash right and so bitcoin is really like a digital form of cash it's a peer-to-peer payment so there's no like intermediary in the middle charging them a fee is there more risk when you're sending money through bitcoin so there's not in it depends yeah there's different kinds of risk right so um one of the things that merchants face are chargebacks there's no chargeback risk in bitcoin it's it's like good funds like the cash just arrives in in bitcoin that sounds great just a package of cash yeah that'd be great it just arrives yeah but i mean one thing that's that's more risky right now is that bitcoin is still pretty volatile the price of it right so you know if you do accept bitcoin and the price goes up or down tomorrow it could change five ten percent or more um because it's still quite volatile so i guess you are having that sort of risk ",
        "6": "bitcoin is such just it's like an unchartered territory it's like the wild west it is it really is you're like you're like a cowboy in the wild west well hopefully we're not all cowboys and indians i think we're you know we have like a great compliance team we have amazing legal counsel we have amazing investors so yeah i think we're slowly we didn't have legal counsel i don't think probably not i think i think we're moving we need really good lawyers we kind of have a foot in both worlds we're partly like you know in the realm of stodgy old financial services like with bankers and things and then we're also kind of partly a tech company doing hackathons and things like that so why'd you start this company well um i mean i want to see payments become more efficient i want to see there's billions of people in the world actually who don't have access to financial services as well but they now increasingly have a smartphone and so we think a lot of you know the traditional sort of bank business model doesn't actually work for those people um because if you're you know living in a ",
        "7": "slum or something like that and you only have 20 to your name um it doesn't make sense to like deposit that in a bank and then the the bank makes money by loaning out deposits so the business model doesn't work unless you have substantial amount of money deposited with them whereas with bitcoin that doesn't matter it's just a piece of software um we can have that installed on you know android phones around the world and it's very low cost service that we can provide so my only concern with that would be like the people you're saying someone who's living in a slum or you know in say africa or somewhere else who doesn't have um you know i know that like bitcoin you can use in a lot of different countries as well but um my only concern with that is do they know how to will they be able to figure this out is it too complicated for them will people figure it out yes actually i think they will so you know i think there's going to be kids who grow up in in india or something like that and they have a smartphone and it turns out you know they have 100 bits on there which is a tiny amount of bitcoin and they start to ",
        "8": "trade that with their friends and they start to use it it's like hogs but not yep and they there's going to be somewhere like the local kiosk on their street corner where they can get cell phone credits um you know but instead of having to like you know pay to do a cash economy or to a lot of people in developing world also sms phone cell phone minutes to each other as a form of digital currency but it costs fees because the tel the telcos there are charging fees for that so this is suddenly like a way for them to have free payments um anywhere in the world i'm like the valley girl i'm like brian armstrong from coinbase so let's see what's really in your wallet okay yeah so you got some money i got some money got some credit cards here yep some different some different places what's this key card yeah it's an accident that's your name on it yep that's exciting this is a very like efficient wallet i feel like my wallet is like way like has is taking up way too much space yeah good job let's figure out how to get some coffee with bitcoin okay "
