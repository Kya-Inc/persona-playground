        "1": "are in the undertaking process no I mean we've been pursuing those conversations with separate tracks just like we are in various countries around the world but you're correct I mean there has been a stark contrast you know in the US the SEC has taken a regulation by enforcement approach instead of engaging with the industry to create rulemaking as as they should and we feel very confident in our case there which is now going through the court system I think it'll be a landmark case and a lot of people in the crypto space have really uh thanked us and thanked me personally um with amicus briefs and just personal notes saying thank you for standing up for the industry making sure that the law is followed we also need to make sure that we get new legislation passed in the U.S so we don't see that type of activity from the regulator in the future but in Canada the story's been totally different we've had very productive conversations with the regulator they're engaging very thoughtfully in a rule making process with us and that pre-registration undertaking that we've now signed is an incredibly positive step in the right direction so I can't I can't say enough good things about the Canadian Regulators it ",
        "2": "in part because our regulatory process is not divided between any regulation and securities regulation Canadian framework that is being developed that you think could ultimately apply to the United States you know I think that's a really important point in the U.S as you pointed out we do have different Financial Service Regulators on the Commodities and security side what that's caused unfortunately is a a battle a Turf War you know it's essentially created political Behavior at the regulator um level at the very top of those agencies and that's not helping anybody in the U.S in most of the other markets that we interact with there's just one Financial Service regulator for both Commodities and securities and the debates about which type of crypto asset is one or the other is is more of an um it's a wonky point that intellectually could be interesting but it's not actually the focus of creating sensible regulation that protects consumers and innovation in that vein then did what happened with the SEC and I know that ",
        "3": "it's still ongoing spook off any institutional discussions that you had been having particularly here in Canada I mean our Canadian financial institutions are known for being risk averse have they wanted to stay away from doing business us or Partnerships with coinbase until this is resolved well I would say just as a general comment on institutional investors yes they are often looking for regulatory Clarity the good news is that we're starting to see that emerge in Canada uh the pre-registration undertaking that we just signed was a great step again in that direction um I I would say actually the the misstep in the United States by the SEC has created an opportunity for other regions and we've seen that now in Canada where they're stepping in to embrace this this really important technology we're seeing it in the UK we're seeing it in UAE we're seeing it in Singapore so the US is actually surprisingly a bit of an outlier here and I have to say it's not the entire ",
        "4": "U.S it's really just uh one or two people that are outliers most of the folks I speak with in government the U.S they understand the potential of this technology as well so the U.S system will correct on its own time but in the meantime we're excited to invest more in Canada in regions where regulatory Clarity is already starting to emerge and you mentioned the the regulatory landscape at the OSU and others did require registration and exchanges were faced with a choice they could either comply or they could leave binance is one of those that chose to leave there's been other instances where a coinbase has taken a different approach or a different path from binance would you characterize as binance as sort of a bad actor in crypto well I don't want to speak about any other companies in the space I'll leave that for others to decide but what I can say is about coinbase you know we've been committed since the earliest days of this company which you know we've been around since 2012 more than 10 years now even even back in 2012 we decided that we wanted to this to be ",
        "5": "regulated and trusted and safe institution and Industry and we actually leaned into regulation and compliance even before it was clear you know you think we think it might be unclear now in some areas it was much more unclear back then I can I can reassure you so I think the culture of coin Mesa has really been a differentiator for us on the compliance front and if we can make crypto trusted and easy to use by working with Regulators by having a really incredible cyber security practices by you know we became a listed company in the US which required us to meet the highest levels of accounting standards so you know you don't have to take our word for it we have a big four accounting firm kind of auditing our books these are things that we've helped do to help Advance the industry in the right direction and I think customers recognize that and it's it's there's been a flight to Quality in in this past year where it's benefited coinbase I know that you don't want to talk overtly about binance but a lot of analysts bring it up when talking about coinbase just because of its sheer size and scale and that if it runs into trouble it ",
        "6": "casts a Paul on the whole sector and ultimately that will affect you yeah well you know we actually I mean we saw this happen um last year of course with FTX as well and you know it's really unfortunate in traditional Financial Services sometimes we see Bad actors you know the classic ones Bernie Madoff Etc um Enron and it seems that in this this new Financial system we're also seeing some Bad actors come on the scene um again I try not to focus too much on that I try to just focus on what we can control at coinbase we try to we try to be trusted we try to make the easiest to use products to sort of demystify this technology so more people can benefit from it we try to surround ourselves with good governance um the highest compliance standards so you know that's I I believe in focusing on what we can control and I know the technology potential here is there it's here to like in a way that can actually benefit people and so I'm not going to let a few bad actors kind of derail us from our broader Mission as part of this International push because you are ",
        "7": "facing sort of falling revenues there's reports that perhaps even market share domestically in the US is being taken by the likes of Robin Hood is that kind of increasing the impetus to look outside the U.S for growth opportunities in addition to kind of what you're going through on the regulatory front yeah well I would disagree with the premise there a little bit I think in the U.S in q1 and Q2 in our earnings we reported positive adjusted ebitda so I think we really um have shown a really good Financial Health there you know we have over five billion dollars on the balance sheet um actually our simple trading product grew and share in Q2 uh we shared that in our earnings as well now I mean just broadly your question you know about other services integrating crypto we want more companies out there to integrate crypto even even some that are competitive or semi-competitive our vision here is that we believe crypto is the most important technology to update the financial system globally the financial system is in major need of an update by the way if you ask most ",
        "8": "Canadians and others um you know they say the fees are sometimes High payments take too long especially internationally it's banking services are not equally distributed to people all over the world and so I think crypto is an important technology the most important technology to update that Financial system globally so those are the things we to achieve that mission we need crypto to be integrated into every aspect of the traditional Financial system and new fintechs around the world and so we're trying to make that easier we don't see it as a zero-sum game what does that update to the financial system look like because many people view it as just an outright disrupter if only it would gain traction and ultimately that's the ultimate criticism of crypto it is still nothing but a vehicle for speculation yeah well I would say I disagree with that I the early days of crypto certainly had lots of speculation and there's still some of that happening today but I'd say that view is probably four to five years out of date we what we've seen in the last four to five ",
        "9": "years is that people have started to use crypto for a variety of things they've started to use it for things like stable coins payments nfts which are more like artwork new ways for creators to get paid things like D5 have created new more efficient decentralized protocols for financial services things like borrowing and lending and then there's a lot of other things on the horizon as well new forms of decentralized identity social media um you know we're even we even launched our own kind of Layer Two solution called base which is helping crypto scale to the next level kind of similar to how the internet went from dial up to broadband and we've had over 100 companies startups um actually engage and build on top of that platform so we're seeing a lot of developer activity building these next generation of applications you know coinbase Ventures has even invested in eight different startups in Canada alone that are building new applications on top of blockchain so I think the future is bright crypto is going to be much ",
        "10": "more than just a speculative asset class although trading is certainly a big use case and we're going to see it touch all aspects of financial services and non-financial service use cases that's really web three uh the next generation of the internet on the has had bit coin apps we're still waiting to see whether the SEC will green light those in the United States I mean given the tenor and flavor of the SEC these days are you optimistic that A1 would be greenlit and B what could that mean to your business if people could start trading crypto in their traditional portfolios yeah so I am optimistic that one of the ETFs will get approved and I hope that something similar happens in Canada as well um you know the the head of the SEC may not be may not like crypto or want to approve them but you know the US government um has made it clear that they want to have a clear path for these things to exist there's no there's no legal reason it's blocking it and I think um One Way ",
        "11": "Or Another We're going to get these approved in the U.S and I don't see it as really competitive to coinbase in fact again back to my prior comment we want crypto to be integrated into more and more of the economy ETFs will open up new uh Capital you know certain people who don't have access maybe to traditional ways of investing or they don't feel comfortable they're LP agreements we could see ETFs bring in a lot of fresh Capital into crypto so we're we're certainly Pro ETF and coinbase has been named as the custodian in many of these ETF applications which I think is a great representation of our trust we've created in the ecosystem and of approved here in Canada to your point about how Canada's regulatory process has been further along a final question again I hate to go back to the legal battle but how much are you willing to spend on this have you attached a dollar figure and are you getting support you mentioned those amicus briefs from professors from you know the blockchain association from Big prominent VC funds are they putting dollars behind this ",
        "12": "because it could set precedent yeah well we haven't shared an exact figure of the legal cost but as I mentioned earlier you can see in our public financials that we have over five billion dollars on the balance sheet we were able to positive in q1 and Q2 so I'm not worried about the financial cost of the of the litigation uh what I'm most worried about is you know as a citizen of the United States how much damage it could be doing to the country I think coinbase will be fine um I'm more worried about the other startups in the space the chilling effect um but really you know America stumbling here is the rest of the world's opportunity and coinbase is a global company and so we're going to continue to invest in markets where Clarity is emerging including Canada and I think um it's their opportunity to to grow share and there's a competitive environment for countries just like companies the goes in believe that that's kind of the whole hope U.S just wants to kill crypto ",
        "13": "well I think the US has a lot of different people in government with different motives um I I do believe at this point that um the SEC you know at least the chair is is trying to curtail crypto I don't think that there's a good faith effort to regulate it I think they're trying to curtail it but there's lots of other people at the SEC that we interact with which are really fine individuals and we have very productive relationships with them and you know the good news is that um things change in the U.S every every four to eight years and so um I think one way or another either through congressional action to make new legislation which we've seen good progress on the cftc is asserting their Authority the Court's uh case that's playing out or with new SEC chairs in the future I think America will get to the right answer here um but you know coinbase is going to make sure we do our part to help ensure that it happens "
