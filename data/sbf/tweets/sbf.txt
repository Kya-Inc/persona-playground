From my drafted congressional testimony in December
I'm glad Mr. Ray is finally paying lip service to turning the exchange back on after months of squashing such efforts!  I'm still waiting for him to finally admit FTX US is solvent and give customers their money back...https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-us-balance-update-2023-01-17…
FTX US is solvent, as it always as been.https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-us-balance-update-2023-01-17…
TL;DR:  1) S&C files, claiming FTX US is insolvent 2) S&C forgot to include bank balances, ~$428m 3) Once you add those back in, you get in the neighborhood of my prior balance sheet (~+$350m) 4) Other slides in the same filing demonstrate (2)
https://sambf.substack.com/p/ftx-pre-mortem-overview…
None of these are me.  I'm not and couldn't be moving any of those funds; I don't have access to them anymore.
I believe it is likely the case that various legit legs of FTX have the ability to access these funds; hopefully that's what's happening here.  If not, hopefully one steps in soon to do so.  I would be happy to help advise regulators on this if any wanted.
1) I still do not have access to much of my data -- professional or personal.  So there is a limit to what I will be able to say, and I won't be as helpful as I'd like.  But as the committee still thinks it would be useful, I am willing to testify on the 13th.
2) I will try to be helpful during the hearing, and to shed what light I can on:  --FTX US's solvency and American customers  --Pathways that could return value to users internationally  --What I think led to the crash  --My own failings
3) I had thought of myself as a model CEO, who wouldn't become lazy or disconnected.  Which made it that much more destructive when I did.  I'm sorry.  Hopefully people can learn from the difference between who I was and who I could have been.
I made a lot of big mistakes this year.  But this wasn't one of them.  There's no evidence, because it didn't happen.  Please, please, focus on your own house.
Rep. Waters, and the House Committee on Financial Services:  Once I have finished learning and reviewing what happened, I would feel like it was my duty to appear before the committee and explain.  I'm not sure that will happen by the 13th.  But when it does, I will testify.
Expanding on DealBook:  When I filed, I'm fairly sure FTX US was solvent, and that all US customers could be made whole.  To my knowledge, it still is today.  I was expecting that to happen.  I'm surprised it hasn't.  I'm not sure why US withdrawals were turned off.
I’ll be speaking with  at the  summit next Wednesday (11/30).
1) What
31) And in the future, I'm going to care less about the dumb, contentless, "good actor" framework.  What matters is what you do--is *actually* doing good or bad, not just *talking* about doing good or *using ESG language*.
32) Anyway -- none of that matters now.  What matters is doing the best I can.  And doing everything I can for FTX's customers.
30) (Some of what I said was thoughtless or overly strong--I was venting and not intending that to be public.  I guess at this point what I write leaks anyway.)
29) Which means that interacting with regulatory structures can be really frustrating: a *huge* amount of work--much of it arbitrary--and relatively little customer protection.  Fuck that.  You all deserve frameworks that let regulators protect customers while allowing freedom.
28) Even so, there are regulators who have deeply impressed me with their knowledge and thoughtfulness.  The CFTC has; the SCB, and VARA, too.  And others, scattered.  But most are overwhelmed.
27) A few thoughts:  a) It's *really* hard to be a regulator.  They have an impossible job: to regulate entire industries that grow faster than their mandate allows them to.  And so often they end up mostly unable to police as well as they ideally would.
26) Well, that gives some color, I guess.  It sucks.  I'm really sorry that things ended up as they did.  And as I said--I'm going to do everything I can to make it more right.
25) Last night I talked to a friend of mine.  They published my messages.  Those were not intended to be public, but I guess they are now.
24) Shrapnel
23) Roughly 25% of customer assets were withdrawn each day--$4b.  As it turned out, I was wrong: leverage wasn't ~$5b, it was ~$13b.  $13b leverage, total run on the bank, total collapse in asset value, all at once.  Which is why you don't want that leverage.  ---
22) And that risk was correlated--with the other collateral, and with the platform.  And then the crash came.  In a few day period, there was a historic crash--over 50% in most correlated assets, with no bid side liquidity.  And at the same time there was a run on the bank.
21) And problems were brewing.  Larger than I realized.  [AGAIN THESE NUMBERS ARE APPROXIMATE, TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE, ETC.]  Leverage built up-- ~$5b of leverage, backed by ~$20b of assets which were....  Well, they had value.  FTT had value, in EV!  But they had risk.
20) I was on the cover of every magazine, and FTX was the darling of Silicon Valley.  We got overconfident and careless.
19) Once upon a time--a month ago--FTX was a valuable enterprise.  FTX had ~$10-15b of daily volume, and roughly $1b of annual revenue.  $40b of equity value.  And we were held as paragons of running an effective company.
18) Truth and Beauty
1) Hi all:  Today, I filed FTX, FTX US, and Alameda for voluntary Chapter 11 proceedings in the US.
4) I'm going to work on giving clarity on where things are in terms of user recovery ASAP.
5) I'm piecing together all of the details, but I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did earlier this week.  I will, soon, write up a more complete post on the play by play, but I want to make sure that I get it right when I do.
3) This doesn't necessarily have to mean the end for the companies or their ability to provide value and funds to their customers chiefly, and can be consistent with other routes.  Ultimately I'm optimistic that Mr. Ray and others can help provide whatever is best.
We hope this is just step one: beginning to find ways to bring liquidity to users.  That is the core thing that I am fighting for right now, and will continue to fight for in whatever ways I can.
1) I'm sorry.  That's the biggest thing.  I fucked up, and should have done better.
21) NOT ADVICE, OF ANY KIND, IN ANY WAY  I WAS NOT VERY CAREFUL WITH MY WORDS HERE, AND DO NOT MEAN ANY OF THEM IN A TECHNICAL OR LEGAL SENSE; I MAY WELL HAVE NOT DESCRIBED THINGS RIGHT though I'm trying to be transparent.  I'M NOT A GOOD DEV AND PROBABLY MISDESCRIBED SOMETHING.
22) And, finally:  I sincerely apologize.  We'll keep sharing updates as we have them.
20) At some point I might have more to say about a particular sparring partner, so to speak.  But you know, glass houses.  So for now, all I'll say is:  well played; you won.
19) A few other assorted comments:  This was about FTX International.  FTX US, the US based exchange that accepts Americans, was not financially impacted by this shitshow.  It's 100% liquid.  Every user could fully withdraw (modulo gas fees etc).  Updates on its future coming.
18) But all of that isn't what matters right now--what matters right now is trying to do right by customers.  That's it.
1) Hey all: I have a few announcements to make.  Things have come full circle, and http://FTX.com’s first, and last, investors are the same: we have come to an agreement on a strategic transaction with Binance for http://FTX.com (pending DD etc.).
5) I know that there have been rumors in media of conflict between our two exchanges, however Binance has shown time and again that they are committed to a more decentralized global economy while working to improve industry relations with regulators. We are in the best of hands.
6) (Note that http://FTX.us and http://Binance.us–two separate companies–are not currently impacted by this.  http://FTX.us’s withdrawals are and have been live, is fully backed 1:1, and operating normally.)
1) A huge thank you to everyone who has supported us--we're excited to keep climbing together.  And especially to those who stay level headed during crazy times.  We deeply appreciate it.
4) And in the end you should do what you want, and trade where you want.  We're grateful to those who stay; and when this blows over we'll welcome everyone else back.
5) As always -- a huge thank you to our supporters.  And to everyone else, as well, as long as they keep building and keep moving the industry forward.  We'll keep building too.
1) Posting about what everything wants to know more about:  SEND!
4) Anyway I was going to write a different thread, but I took a deep breath and reminded myself of something we'd all do well to remember:  that we're all in this together, and I wish the best to *everyone* driving the industry forward.
5) Because I respect the hell out of what y'all have done to build the industry as we see it today, whether or not they reciprocate, and whether or not we use the same methods.  Including CZ.  Anyway -- as always -- it's time to build.  Make love (and blockchain), not war.
BTW -- Quant Zone is way faster now!  And, they're sharable.https://ftx.com/quant-zone/rules…
BTW on the blue check marks:  so far the discourse has centered around them as vanity, but remember that for people in finance, they help weed out scammers posing as someone else  also this post is gonna get a lot of scammer spam isn't it
1) I was a significant donor in both D and R primaries.  Supporting constructive candidates across the aisle to prevent pandemics and bring a bipartisan climate to DC.  And working with them to support permissionless finance.
4) Excited to see what happens on Tuesday!
5) (As an aside: when I talk about pandemic prevention, I really do mean *prevention*.  We should be working to stop the next pandemic *before* it happens, not imposing restrictive mandates for this one.)
3) If you want to contribute crypto, reach out to your elected officials and ask if they accept it; FTX is happy to sign them up!
Max funding rates never really made sense to me.  If the fair rate is very negative then bounding funding rates just makes perps illiquid.
We're excited to help return the assets quickly to customers
1) Alright alright, Coinbase 2022Q3 earnings:https://s27.q4cdn.com/397450999/files/doc_financials/2022/q3/Q32022-Shareholder-Letter.pdf…previous:
5) My reading of this is, roughly:  a) $145m of the difference is encumbered capital which will be returned b) $100m or so of loss to FX moving  So something like a real loss of $400m, and a 'predictive' loss of $300m.
6) Annualizing this out, and netting out staking, you get something like:  Revenue: $2b Expenses: $3.2b  Once again, the vast majority of expenses seem to be headcount--roughly 80%.  They have roughly $6b on hand.
welcome!

1) we passed on Twitter b/c it didn't seem like our strengths were what was needed for Elon's vision for Twitter  (e.g. if he wanted to do blockchain-based social media, or blockchain wallets/payments, we'd have been excited to work on that!  and who knows, maybe he still will)
2) In some ways it mirrors https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1586483627487277056…:  a) Twitter needed a revamping of leadership, so Elon did that  b) now Twitter has strong leadership, and we're excited for Elon to execute *his* vision for it

This roughly lines up with my instincts fwiw; thanks for writing up !  We need  advocating for us online and making the bull case for blockchain  And *I* would think that we need people hashing out the *details* in DC--implementing the will of industry.
still putting the finishing touches on it (not live yet), but you'll be able to create a profile and accept crypto & fiat by that tag as well soon!
Interesting to see the relationship between public polls and policymakers
A new feature on http://ftx.com and http://ftx.us:  Send!  Send crypto (or dollars) to any email or phone number.
It's been really interesting paying more attention to foreign policy statements globally  So much of it is people talking past each other--either for political reasons, or because they actually don't understand where the other side is coming from  We, as a world, can do better

This is either a great endorsement of their belief in their own value add as a business, or a great condemnation of their judgement:  investment bank who gets paid to help restructurings hires 20 other investment banks to help with its own restructure
when "customer protection" goes awry: exploitative data fees and restrictive market access combines with insane leverage and forced liquidations  there's a better way
it's that time of the week againhttp://ftx.com/fttNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
1) A really promising update from HK on crypto: https://info.gov.hk/gia/general/202210/31/P2022103000454.htm?fontSize=1…If only it had come last year...
2) I deeply appreciate when policymakers engage constructively and optimistically with the people who matter the most for an industry's direction:  the customers.
1) My *final* thoughts/post on this:
7) There are a huge number of possibly paths here--some fairly subtle--and I worry that some people haven't fully thought out, empirically, what the result would be of possible decisions we could make.  But hopefully I'm wrong about that.  Crypto Twitter, take the wheel.
8) One last thing:  I *am* seriously concerned that some relatively strident/adversarial strategies would end up backfiring and undermining DeFi.  I'm fine with CT leading the way--so for all our sakes I hope I'm wrong!  But I won't *actively* support things I think backfire.
1) Meta Mark
24) Sometimes the easiest answer is the right one.  Zuck is planning to spend tens of billions on building out The Metaverse because he believes in The Metaverse.  It was a great distraction.  But simultaneously it was also real.
25) Facebook has the largest possible social media network on the web.  They won.  So what's next?  Start building Social Media 3.0.
23) So, to be clear, I *do* think that the above claims might be true:  Facebook wanted to distract people from its reputation and its lack of headroom for growth, and so it became Meta.  But I think there's probably something else, too.  Something that explains the next $10b.
22) Which makes no sense if this is all a diversion.  It's one thing to blow $10b/year on smoke bombs.  It's another thing to blow $10b/year on smoke bombs that don't produce very much smoke.  Why throw good money after bad?
21) Except there's one last problem.  Investors have now decided that spending $10b per year on The Metaverse is dumb, and Facebook (er, sorry, Meta)'s stock is tanking.  The vague meta guidance is no longer working.  And yet Zuck keeps spending.
20) And so that could explain why Facebook did it:  to distract from its reputational problems, and to project on a vague and unclear and futuristic enough space that they could convince people that maybe they were going to make another $100b from it,  Facebook became Meta.
19) You need something which is everything and nothing.  Something which could be the whole world, but where no one knows what to expect or how to know if you're doing it yet.  You need The Metaverse.
18) Something with the following properties:  a) People think that maybe it could get really big.  Like, $100b revenue big.  b) If Facebook plows $10b into it people will be like "yes, that is how you make this thing really big, I guess, sure", and not ask any more questions.
1) Advising
19) That's how we operate, and the way that we would be able to collaborate.  If that doesn't work--if we aren't able to have a nuanced, detailed conversation acknowledging realities--then that sucks, but so be it.  There's no point in debating if it isn't constructive.
20) And the only remaining decision is whether we should run with *our* beliefs about what is best, or whether someone else should take the lead.  And we're fine either way!  Because usually we all agree on the ultimate goal--it's a question of the best strategy.
18) So anyway, long story short:  If people disagree with us, we're super excited to chat and see if we can come to agree!  Hopefully we can do so in a *constructive* way that acknowledges nuance and cares about the details and doesn't try to steamroll or judge.
that's definitely my best guess at the effective way to communicate and negotiate and engage!  I'm not perfect at it (I can think of one or two fuckups :P).  I try.  but idk to each their own
6) I hope, for all our sakes, that the crypto twitter community has carefully considered all of the details of possible bills and policy proposals, and that the crypto twitter community correctly understands the details of policymaking and negotiation and alliances in DC.

Latency down another ~20% since the last update!
Come watch 2 people who aren't regulators talk about regulating things, as if they had the power to regulate!
It's crucial that our markets infrastructure and regulation holds DCO and FCM margin/leverage to the same standard.  'out of sight, out of mind' does not make for good systemic risk protection, and 'in sight, in mind' does not make for equitable treatment and competition.

Eh to clarify: we are figuring out what we're doing on stablecoins; it could be anything or nothing, and could *or could not* involve partnerships, issuance, hula hoops, etc.  (One of those is less likely than the others.)
Disagree.  Those same companies could generally really use a smaller, learner team anyway.

Everyone: "salami"  Ryan: "No you don't get it, it's Salem"  Everyone: "ok fine"  Ryan: "well really it's more like sa-la-may"  Everyone: ...
1) Phishing sucks
8) Anyway, recently a frustrating thing happened.  We’ve mostly stamped out sites that try to phish users by masquerading as FTX.  But we can’t fix fake sites impersonating *other* services.  A few users accidentally registered at fake other sites, including 3 Commas.
TO BE CLEAR 3 COMMAS ISN'T FAKE, THERE WERE FAKE SITES PRETENDING TO BE 3 COMMAS
15) Anyway -- maybe a time to try out the 5-5 standard on the 3Commas/phishing scammer!  If they send back ~$5.7m (~95%) of the scam within 24h to 0xD15ff86129c3Da57756b33827DfFF6D252602284, we'll absolve them.
16) Their addresses:  a) 0x6D3e6Ba1b510287141b27F763A86E04c72a001D1 b) 0xaB8bd0D4Eda57cd9EE5A058e498A791dF13dFA65 c) 0x87c828593984381E50D55F755B8462e074047Cf7
14) But this once, we'll do it; roughly $6m total.  (To be clear, only for FTX accounts!  Hopefully other exchanges will comp theirs.)  BUT AGAIN NOT A PRECEDENT, WE WILL NOT GOING FORWARD.
1) Whelp, that was an interesting few days.  A retrospective.
18)While I don’t myself wear glasses, I’m excited to join our bespectacled brethren.  It’s a huge honor to see the passion and intensity with which Bitboy regards me.  Maybe someday I’ll feel as strongly about something as he does about me.
19) Anyway, enough policy for now.  Back to building.
17) Anyway: I totally understand that lots of people will disagree with me on various points.  That’s great—it means I have people to learn from.  And I really do think that regulation is going to get better, clearer, and create pathways for crypto to come back onshore.
holy shit 100 retweets, 40 likes, 17 comments--those spam bots are really leveling up  (or else  is feeling very generous.  Really could be either way!)
1) Binance converts USDC --> BUSD, and we see the change in supplies.  Thus begins the Second Great Stablecoin War.  (The first one, fought in ~2018, ended with USDC and USDT edging out TUSD/GUSD/USDP.)
TO BE CLEAR 3 COMMAS ISN'T FAKE, THERE WERE FAKE SITES PRETENDING TO BE 3 COMMAS
15) Anyway -- maybe a time to try out the 5-5 standard on the 3Commas/phishing scammer!  If they send back ~$5.7m (~95%) of the scam within 24h to 0xD15ff86129c3Da57756b33827DfFF6D252602284, we'll absolve them.

14) But this once, we'll do it; roughly $6m total.  (To be clear, only for FTX accounts!  Hopefully other exchanges will comp theirs.)  BUT AGAIN NOT A PRECEDENT, WE WILL NOT GOING FORWARD.
3) At this point, we're probably the largest unaligned players in the stablecoin ecosystem.  Bybit, the various blockchains, tradfi, and market makers are as well.  (Worth asking what the futures are of USDK, HUSD, etc.)
4) Finally--it'll be interesting to see what emerges from the non-fiat-backed-stablecoin space, post-Luna and post-DAI-holding-USDC.  My guess is that it will be something interest bearing or otherwise with some upside.
2) What's different this time is:  a) positive interest rates --> more revenue for stablecoins  b) by now they've all learned the core lesson: NEVER EVER BLOCK REDEMPTIONS or your stablecoin will no longer be stable
<3  Really appreciate all the feedback—I really do think that DCCPA will be better for it.  I definitely take Eric’s point that free smart contracts are essential and I wasn’t clear enough about that.  In the end a strong free decentralized economy is what matters
Thank you, to everyone who gave feedback.  Except, apparently, bitboy, and people with glasses???
We're excited and hopeful to receive approval from the bankruptcy court so we can begin working closely with the Voyager team to return the funds to customers as soon as legally possible.

ICYMI: scaled orders live on FTX!http://ftx.com/trade/BTC/USD
this is the dumbest take  we, *and every other major centralized US exchange*, have had to do this for the last few years to comply with regs.  This is just our internal analysis and doesn't have any regulatory weight and isn't meant to influence anyone else's behavior.
1) Some new things at FTX!
7) also idk if any of you guys heard but I posted some thoughts about crypto policy recently, also I think we should not send funds to North Korea and instead fight for presumptive economic freedom on peer to peer xfers/validators/defi if you wanna complain then do so here
8) (or 2) ok had issues with tweet 2 but: there's now a Beta UI to see new UI features when they're raw!
6) New wire deposit instructions on http://ftx.us/wallet!
If only...
100% -- in particular people are paying close attention to the language to make sure it doesn't end up killing DeFi, which is super important
Personally, I think that "3.5% rates are reasonable" is totally compatible with "messaging that it's ok to invest again"
Keeping DeFi and peer to peer transfers free is crucial.  There are policies I honestly think are key to achieving that.  I could be wrong about those policies--I probably am wrong about some!  But in the end the most important thing is to keep commerce and expression free.
Thanks to everyone who gave feedback.  At the very least, I'm going to update/edit to clarify that DeFi should not be censored.
to be clear I never meant to imply that it should!  It shouldn't.  But allowing for the *ability* for DeFi to ultimately interface with regulated entities, when phrased poorly, could be read to imply a need to.  And to be clear I don't think it should need to.
1) As promised:  My current thoughts on crypto regulation.https://ftxpolicy.com/posts/possible-digital-asset-industry-standards…
14) But my support for any particular bill, framework, etc. is absolutely contingent on those points--contingent on them actually protecting customers, and them actually protecting economic freedom.  Anyway, here's the blog post link once again: https://ftxpolicy.com/posts/possible-digital-asset-industry-standards….
15) And, finally:  NONE OF THIS IS LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR INVESTMENT ADVICE.
13) I'm optimistic that we're making progress on that last point.  I'm optimistic, for instance, that the Stabenow-Boozman bill would protect customers while also protecting economic freedom; and that federal regulators are making progress towards thoughtful frameworks.
1) I’ll post more later, but:  a) Crypto—and for that matter, commerce in general—does not function without peer to peer transfers and a presumption of freedom b) it has to be free to write software as long as it is not eg a scam c) validators’ job is to validate not to police
2) I’m optimistic that the Stabenow-Boozman’s bill will provide customer protection on centralized crypto exchanges without endangering the existence of software, blockchains, validators, DeFi, etc.  If I were convinced I was wrong about that, I would not support it.
3) (Nothing here means that it’s ok to send to a sanctioned party, scam people, etc.)

Sometimes, when things are seeming too meta, nothing feels better than launching products.  So really baller to see  crank out a major  product from start to finish in 3 hours last night, even if it might never see the light of day.
FTX is excited to be regulated in Dubai by VARA!  We're excited to expand out our presence in the city, and to work with regulators who have taken the lead in establishing a regulatory framework for digital assets, protecting customers and allowing for innovation.
100% agree on disclosures, knowledge tests, etc.  FWIW I don't know that it necessarily makes sense to be crypto-specific--I think that having, at least, mandates for disclosures and for knowledge-based tests for all FCMs/DCMs facing retail could make sense.
FWIW you can see disclosures, and a link to proposed knowledge-based tests/etc., for a prospective, if-approved FTX US Derivatives site, here: https://ftx.us/derivs/
1) When it comes to oracles,  you just have to make up your own damn mind
22) Which doesn't mean that the risk engine needs to be manual.  You can create a set of rules for it so that it's conservative, and handles apparent large moves gracefully.  That, in the end, is probably the most important thing we do at FTX.
23) And, really, it's why we started FTX in the first place.  Tradfi had sophisticated (sometimes!), slow, manual risk models, and--in some FCMs--fast, egregious ones.  Crypto had fast, automated, broken risk models.  There was an opening for a thoughtfully automated risk engine.
21) The Oracle tells you everything and nothing--the history and current state of markets.  It's the risk engine's job to consume that information, and decide what positions are safe.  Sometimes it can't just regurgitate The Oracle.  Sometimes it has to make up its own damn mind.
20) Well, it depends on what it's promising.  But probably it's just promising to tell you, literally, what MNGO is currently trading at.  And, for a brief period, on some exchanges, MNGO was in fact trading at $0.40.  The real problem here was using the raw oracle price.
19) There are a bunch of other risk engine protections and sanity checks, too, which would have caught something like this.  So -- back to the oracle.  It reports:  "MNGO: $0.40"  Is it wrong?
18) (It's worth noting that this is all referring to FTX International.  In addition to all of the above protections, our amendment for FTX US Derivative's margin order would only be for BTC and ETH futures using USD margin.  No MNGO, and certainly no MNGO collateral.)

5) (Disclaimers:  a) not financial advice b) won't be live for a day c) see https://docs.ftx.com/#fast-access for details d) right now only for REST e) have to be KYC2 for a week so people can't spam accounts f) mostly helps via API, unless you live near AWS Tokyo g) coming to FTX US soon)
BTC and Nasdaq are roughly in-line with each other, beta-adjusted, since the start of the year  (BTC moves ~2x as much in general)
that time of the weekhttp://ftx.com/fttNOT FINANCIAL ADVICE
still not involved
1) This Thanksgiving:  FTX, Evolved.
6) API traders: keep in touch over the month as we preview some of what we'll be rolling out!  And watch for the grand launch on November 21st.
7) And, finally, a huge thanks to our growing dev team:  turning sleepless nights into higher order throughput and lower API latency.

Moving to a more responsible workforce might be a *reflection* of bad things, but it's generally itself a *good* thing.  I'm confused by market reactions to it.
you know an article is professional when they remember to include a little bit of red in FTX US's logo
ok so now's the time when:  bad number already known/priced in bad number comes people sell because number bad ??? profit  (NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE)
guy hits ball hard and far
with stick, to be clear
congratulations,
this is wild
Heads up: rotating a few FTX wallets today (mostly non-circulating); we do this periodically.  Might be a few more coming, won’t have any effect.
Thanks to some hard work from people way smarter than me, we're seeing matching engine latency on FTX down ~25% on average over the last week!
I'll be on Bloomberg in 5 minutes to talk about Voyager and crypto regulation and definitely no surprise questions about any other topics I'm sure!
Really grateful to work with , , and others to push forward in the US; and a heartfelt goodbye to @Brett_FTX as he transitions to an advisor and FTX US transitions to its Miami HQ!  Being agile and coordinated is a core value--it'll be great to be together.
1) Blacklists and whitelists
13) What's important is that we not bleed over from blacklists to whitelists.  That sanctioning North Korea doesn't slowly slip into only allowing economic activity with a few trusted parties.
14) For more info on FTX's sanction compliance, see here: https://ftxpolicy.com/posts/sanctions-compliance…
12) And so what does that mean for, e.g., Tornado Cash being sanctioned?  I think, basically:  I understand why it happened, and that it's important to prevent illicit finance.  And it was still a blacklist--if an extensive one--not enforcing a whitelist for transfers.
here we go againhttp://ftx.com/ftt(not investment advice)
Spot down 3.4% on FTX  (of GBP, that is.  BTC down less.)https://ftx.com/trade/GBP/USD
boy would the world thinking differently about crypto price moves it they measured it vs world currency baskets instead of just USD
yeah this part confuses me a bit  seems like the last thing you want to do is drive unemployment --> people have less money --> inflation down  the way to attack inflation is supply side or getting rid of uneconomic financing
touchdown
wow

Happy Merge everyone!  Now can we stop mistaking spot/futures arb/collecting the airdrop for putting on a huge delta?
Hearing on the  /  bill in an hour before the Senate Ag committee!https://bit.ly/3S2YUln(I'm in DC today but won't be at the hearing)
oh boy, not a good tweet to confuse 'coinbase' and 'coindesk' in :P
Digital ecosystem: "risk engine runs 24/7 so no margin call unless necessary, can deposit 24/7, is non-recourse.  No extra fees for margin calls, exact formula public."  TradFi: "yeah but margin calls are evil, only classy incumbents should be allowed to do it"  Also TradFi:
It's extremely important that only comic sans is allowed to define margin calls  you wouldn't want full transparency or anythinghttps://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024780511-Complete-Futures-Specs…
we have filed a proposed amendment to our clearinghouse which we believe would create a transparent, limited-recourse, equitable access venue for the US, reducing margin calls by avoiding intraday/overnight margin gaps, and emphasizing customer protection: http://ftxpolicy.com
you know what time of week it is

1) The freedom of the goat
13) If there's nothing you *need* to prove, you're free to prove *everything*.  Free to keep getting better.https://youtube.com/watch?v=xFZqk8k4QwQ…
14) Anyway, I wish we were the GOAT, but realistically we're still more of the upstart, with a bit of a chip on our shoulder; misfits as much as anything else.  We're definitely not perfect; you all remind us of our weaknesses every day.  But hopefully we can keep getting better.
Somehow it makes me really happy that 's first play of his 45 year old season wasn't just a 24y pass--it was a clever, well-orchestrated pass for 24 YAC.
1) I have sympathy for this POV: if you censor communication it breaks a lot: https://twitter.com/matthuang/status/1568235735563784193?s=21…2) I *also* think that it's really important that the gateways to the financial world take their duty extremely seriously to prevent financial crimes: https://ftxpolicy.com/posts/sanctions-compliance…
I'm really excited to work with  and ! https://t.co/s7bN30405F
Really excited to be working more closely with  and the  team!
1) I'M NOT A REGULATOR, THIS IS NOT LEGAL ADVICE  but:  my current best guess is consistent what  says: that the CFTC will regulate spot + futures for non-security tokens, and the SEC will regulate spot + issuance of tokens that are securities
4) And, for what it's worth:  I think this is all pretty reasonable; and a resolution providing regulatory oversight along these lines would be healthy for consumers, protect against risk, prevent scams, give clarity to the industry, and allow liquidity to come back to the US.
5) And it's consistent with what  /  drafted--  as well as what  and others have argued for from the customer protection angle
the most impressive people I know are often those that waste no time in building great things
we like the

--"you basically need a new executive team and a totally new culture"... one industry official told WaPo.  --'Bezos... is committing more of his weekly schedule to Blue Origin.'  They have a legendary leader--why doesn't _he_ take the reigns?
1) One cool application of on-chain social media:  In-message verification.
5) But you could actually do even more.  You could, for instance, tweet out:  "Here's a verified fact!  2 + 2 = {print(2+2)}", which would just render as '2 + 2 = {print(2+2):4}'.
6) And in general, anything that a blockchain could compute--basically anything a computer program that has access to all other blockchain data could compute--you could embed in your message.  It would be self-evaluating and automatically verified as accurate (or not!).
